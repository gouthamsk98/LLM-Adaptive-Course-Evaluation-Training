Users that need to port their code from GCC 11.2.0 to 12.2.0 should refer to the series of official GCC porting guides listed below:\\n\\n* `Porting to GCC 12 <https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-12/porting_to.html>`_\\n\\n\\nWarnings\\n========\\n\\nThe upgrade to GCC 12.2.0 has resulted in the addition of new warnings, or enhancements to existing warnings. The full details of all GCC warnings can be found in `GCC Warning Options <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-12.2.0/gcc/Warning-Options.html>`_. Users are advised to double-check their code, then fix the warnings if possible. Unfortunately, depending on the warning and the complexity of the user's code, some warnings will be false positives that require non-trivial fixes. In such cases, users can choose to suppress the warning in multiple ways. This section outlines some common warnings that users are likely to encounter and ways to fix them.\\n\\n\\n``-Wuse-after-free``\\n--------------------\\n\\nTypically, this warning should not produce false-positives for release-level code. But this may appear in test cases. There is an example of how it was fixed in ESP-IDF's ``test_realloc.c``.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    void *x = malloc(64);\\n    void *y = realloc(x, 48);\\n    TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_PTR(x, y);\\n\\nPointers may be converted to int to avoid warning ``-Wuse-after-free``.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    int x = (int) malloc(64);\\n    int y = (int) realloc((void *) x, 48);\\n    TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_UINT32((uint32_t) x, (uint32_t) y);\\n\\n``-Waddress``\\n-------------\\n\\nGCC 12.2.0 introduces an enhanced version of the ``-Waddress`` warning option, which is now more eager in detecting the checking of pointers to an array in if-statements.\\n\\nThe following code triggers the warning:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    char array[8];\\n    ...\\n    if (array)\\n        memset(array, 0xff, sizeof(array));\\n\\n\\nEliminating unnecessary checks resolves the warning.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    char array[8];\\n    ...\\n    memset(array, 0xff, sizeof(array));\\n\\n\\nRISC-V Builds Outside of ESP-IDF\\n================================\\n\\nThe RISC-V extensions ``zicsr`` and ``zifencei`` have been separated from the ``I`` extension. GCC 12 reflects this change, and as a result, when building for RISC-V ESP32 chips outside of the ESP-IDF framework, you must include the ``_zicsr_zifencei`` postfix when specifying the -march option in your build system.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  riscv32-esp-elf-gcc main.c -march=rv32imac\\n\\nNow is replaced with:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  riscv32-esp-elf-gcc main.c -march=rv32imac_zicsr_zifencei\\n\",\n",

As a result, if an application allowed ``malloc()`` to allocate memory from external RAM (by configuring the :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_USE` option as ``CONFIG_SPIRAM_USE_MALLOC``), FreeRTOS had the potential to allocate dynamic memory from external RAM, and the specific location was determined by the heap allocator.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Dynamic memory allocation for tasks (which are likely to consume the most memory) were an exception to the scenario above. FreeRTOS would use a separate memory allocation function to guarantee that dynamic memory allocate for a task was always placed in internal RAM.\\n\\n    Allowing FreeRTOS objects (such as queues and semaphores) to be placed in external RAM becomes an issue if those objects are accessed while the cache is disabled (such as during SPI flash write operations) and would lead to a cache access errors (see :doc:`Fatal Errors </api-guides/fatal-errors>` for more details).\\n\\n    Therefore, FreeRTOS has been updated to always use internal memory (i.e., DRAM) for dynamic memory allocation. Calling FreeRTOS creation functions (e.g., :cpp:func:`xTaskCreate`, :cpp:func:`xQueueCreate`) guarantees that the memory allocated for those tasks/objects is from internal memory (see :ref:`freertos-heap` for more details).\\n\\n    .. warning::\\n\\n        If you previously relied on :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_USE` to place FreeRTOS objects into external memory, this change will lead to increased usage of internal memory due the FreeRTOS objects now being allocated there.\\n\\n    To place a FreeRTOS task/object into external memory, it is now necessary to do so explicitly. The following methods can be employed:\\n\\n    - Allocate the task/object using one of the ``...CreateWithCaps()`` API such as :cpp:func:`xTaskCreateWithCaps` and :cpp:func:`xQueueCreateWithCaps` (see :ref:`freertos-idf-additional-api` for more details).\\n    - Manually allocate external memory for those objects using :cpp:func:`heap_caps_malloc`, then create the objects from the allocated memory using one of the ``...CreateStatic()`` FreeRTOS functions.\\n\\nPower Management\\n-----------------------\\n\\n* ``esp_pm_config_esp32xx_t`` is deprecated, use ``esp_pm_config_t`` instead.\\n* ``esp32xx/pm.h`` is deprecated, use ``esp_pm.h`` instead.\\n',\n",

Although it is recommended to use the new driver APIs, the legacy driver is still available in the previous include path ``driver/dac.h``. However, by default, including ``driver/dac.h`` will bring a build warning like ``The legacy DAC driver is deprecated, please use 'driver/dac_oneshot.h', 'driver/dac_cosine.h' or 'driver/dac_continuous.h' instead``. The warning can be suppressed by the Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_DAC_SUPPRESS_DEPRECATE_WARN`.\\n\\n    The major breaking changes in concept and usage are listed as follows:\\n\\n    Breaking Changes in Concepts\\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n    - ``dac_channel_t`` which was used to identify the hardware channel are removed from user space. The channel index now starts from ``0``, so please use  `DAC_CHAN_0` and `DAC_CHAN_1` instead. And in the new driver, DAC channels can be selected by using :cpp:type:`dac_channel_mask_t`. And these channels can be allocated in a same channel group which is represented by :cpp:type:`dac_channels_handle_t`.\\n    - ``dac_cw_scale_t`` is replaced by :cpp:type:`dac_cosine_atten_t` to decouple the legacy driver and the new driver.\\n    - ``dac_cw_phase_t`` is replaced by :cpp:type:`dac_cosine_phase_t`.

       " 'Build System\\n============\\n\\nMigrating from GNU Make Build System\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nESP-IDF v5.0 no longer supports GNU make-based projects. Please follow the :ref:`build system <migrating_from_make>` guide for migration.\\n\\nUpdate Fragment File Grammar\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThe former grammar, supported in ESP-IDF v3.x, was dropped in ESP-IDF v5.0. Here are a few notes on how to migrate properly:\\n\\n1. Indentation is now enforced: improperly indented fragment files generate a runtime parse exception. Although the former version did not enforce this, the previous documentation and examples demonstrated properly indented grammar.\\n2. Migrate the old condition entry to the ``if...elif...else`` structure for conditionals. You can refer to the :ref:`ldgen-conditional-placements` for detailed grammar.\\n3. Mapping fragments now requires a name like other fragment types.\\n\\n\\nSpecify Component Requirements Explicitly\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nIn previous versions of ESP-IDF, some components were always added as public requirements (dependencies) to every component in the build, in addition to the :ref:`common component requirements <component-common-requirements>`:\\n\\n* ``driver``\\n* ``efuse``\\n* ``esp_timer``\\n* ``lwip``\\n* ``vfs``\\n* ``esp_wifi``\\n* ``esp_event``\\n* ``esp_netif``\\n* ``esp_eth``\\n* ``esp_phy``\\n\\nThis means that it was possible to include header files of those components without specifying them as requirements in ``idf_component_register``. This behavior was caused by transitive dependencies of various common components.\\n\\nIn ESP-IDF v5.0, this behavior is fixed and these components are no longer added as public requirements by default.\\n\\nEvery component depending on one of the components which isn\\'t part of common requirements has to declare this dependency explicitly. This can be done by adding ``REQUIRES <component_name>`` or ``PRIV_REQUIRES <component_name>`` in ``idf_component_register`` call inside component\\'s ``CMakeLists.txt``. See :ref:`Component Requirements <component-requirements>` for more information on specifying requirements.\\n\\nSetting ``COMPONENT_DIRS`` and ``EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS`` Variables\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n.. highlight:: cmake\\n\\nESP-IDF v5.0 includes a number of improvements to support building projects with space characters in their paths. To make that possible, there are some changes related to setting ``COMPONENT_DIRS`` and ``EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS`` variables in project CMakeLists.txt files.\\n\\nAdding non-existent directories to ``COMPONENT_DIRS`` or ``EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS`` is no longer supported and will result in an error.\\n\\nUsing string concatenation to define ``COMPONENT_DIRS`` or ``EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS`` variables is now deprecated. These variables should be defined as CMake lists, instead. For example, use::\\n\\n    set(EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS path1 path2)\\n    list(APPEND EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS path3)\\n\\ninstead of::\\n\\n    set(EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS \"path1 path2\")\\n    set(EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS \"${EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS} path3\")\\n\\nDefining these variables as CMake lists is compatible with previous ESP-IDF versions.\\n\\nUpdate Usage of ``target_link_libraries`` with ``project_elf``\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nESP-IDF v5.0 fixes CMake variable propagation issues for components. This issue caused compiler flags and definitions that were supposed to apply to one component to be applied to every component in the project.\\n\\nAs a side effect of this, user projects from ESP-IDF v5.0 onwards must use ``target_link_libraries`` with ``project_elf`` explicitly and custom CMake projects must specify ``PRIVATE``, ``PUBLIC``, or ``INTERFACE`` arguments. This is a breaking change and is not backward compatible with previous ESP-IDF versions.\\n\\nFor example::\\n\\n    target_link_libraries(${project_elf} PRIVATE \"-Wl,--wrap=esp_panic_handler\")\\n\\ninstead of::\\n\\n    target_link_libraries(${project_elf} \"-Wl,--wrap=esp_panic_handler\")\\n\\nUpdate CMake Version\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIn ESP-IDF v5.0 minimal CMake version was increased to 3.16 and versions lower than 3.16 are not supported anymore.  Run ``tools/idf_tools.py install cmake`` to install a suitable version if your OS version doesn\\'t have one.\\n\\nThis affects ESP-IDF users who use system-provided CMake and custom CMake.\\n\\nReorder the Applying of the Target-Specific Config Files\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n.. highlight:: none\\n\\nESP-IDF v5.0 reorders the applying order of target-specific config files and other files listed in SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS. Now, target-specific files will be applied right after the file brings it in, before all latter files in ``SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS``.\\n\\nFor example::\\n\\n    If ``SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=\"sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig_devkit1\"``, and there is a file ``sdkconfig.defaults.esp32`` in the same folder, then the files will be applied in the following order: (1) sdkconfig.defaults (2) sdkconfig.defaults.esp32 (3) sdkconfig_devkit1.\\n\\nIf you have a key with different values in the target-specific files of the former item (e.g., ``sdkconfig.defaults.esp32`` above) and the latter item (e.g., ``sdkconfig_devkit1`` above), please note the latter will override the target-specific file of the former.\\n\\nIf you do want to have some target-specific config values, please put it into the target-specific file of the latter item (e.g., ``sdkconfig_devkit1.esp32``).\\n',\n",
       " 'Networking\\n===========\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nWi-Fi\\n*****\\n\\nCallback Function Type ``esp_now_recv_cb_t``\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nPreviously, the first parameter of ``esp_now_recv_cb_t`` was of type ``const uint8_t *mac_addr``, which only included the address of ESP-NOW peer device.\\n\\nThis now changes. The first parameter is of type ``esp_now_recv_info_t``, which has members ``src_addr``, ``des_addr`` and ``rx_ctrl``. Therefore, the following updates are required:\\n\\n    - Redefine ESP-NOW receive callback function.\\n\\n    - ``src_addr`` can be used to replace original ``mac_addr``.\\n\\n    - ``des_addr`` is the destination MAC address of ESP-NOW packet, which can be unitcast or broadcast address. With ``des_addr``, the user can distinguish unitcast and broadcast ESP-NOW packets where broadcast ESP-NOW packets can be non-encrypted even when encryption policy is configured for the ESP-NOW.\\n\\n    - ``rx_ctrl`` is Rx control info of the ESP-NOW packet, which provides more information about the packet.\\n\\nPlease refer to the ESP-NOW example: :example_file:`wifi/espnow/main/espnow_example_main.c`\\n\\nEthernet\\n********\\n\\n``esp_eth_ioctl()`` API\\n-----------------------\\n\\nPreviously, the :cpp:func:`esp_eth_ioctl` API had the following issues:\\n\\n    - The third parameter (which is of type ``void *``) would accept an ``int``/``bool`` type arguments (i.e., not pointers) as input in some cases. However, these cases were not documented properly.\\n    - To pass ``int``/``bool`` type argument as the third parameter, the argument had to be \"unnaturally\" casted to a ``void *`` type, to prevent a compiler warning as demonstrated in the code snippet below. This casting could lead to misuse of the :cpp:func:`esp_eth_ioctl` function.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    esp_eth_ioctl(eth_handle, ETH_CMD_S_FLOW_CTRL, (void *)true);\\n\\nTherefore, the usage of :cpp:func:`esp_eth_ioctl` is now unified. Arguments to the third parameter must be passed as pointers to a specific data type to/from where data is stored/read by :cpp:func:`esp_eth_ioctl`. The code snippets below demonstrate the usage of :cpp:func:`esp_eth_ioctl`.\\n\\nUsage example to set Ethernet configuration:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    eth_duplex_t new_duplex_mode = ETH_DUPLEX_HALF;\\n    esp_eth_ioctl(eth_handle, ETH_CMD_S_DUPLEX_MODE, &new_duplex_mode);\\n\\nUsage example to get Ethernet configuration:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    eth_duplex_t duplex_mode;\\n    esp_eth_ioctl(eth_handle, ETH_CMD_G_DUPLEX_MODE, &duplex_mode);\\n\\nKSZ8041/81 and LAN8720 Driver Update\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nThe KSZ8041/81 and LAN8720 drivers are updated to support more devices (i.e., generations) from their associated product families. The drivers can recognize particular chip numbers and their potential support by the driver.\\n\\nAs a result, the specific \"chip number\" functions calls are replaced by generic ones as follows:\\n\\n* Removed ``esp_eth_phy_new_ksz8041()`` and ``esp_eth_phy_new_ksz8081()``, and use :cpp:func:`esp_eth_phy_new_ksz80xx` instead\\n* Removed ``esp_eth_phy_new_lan8720()``, and use :cpp:func:`esp_eth_phy_new_lan87xx` instead\\n\\n\\nESP NETIF Glue Event Handlers\\n-----------------------------\\n\\n``esp_eth_set_default_handlers()`` and ``esp_eth_clear_default_handlers()`` functions are removed. Registration of the default IP layer handlers for Ethernet is now handled automatically. If you have already followed the suggestion to fully initialize the Ethernet driver and network interface before registering their Ethernet/IP event handlers, then no action is required (except for deleting the affected functions). Otherwise, you may start the Ethernet driver right after they register the user event handler.\\n\\nPHY Address Auto-detect\\n-----------------------\\n\\nThe Ethernet PHY address auto-detect function ``esp_eth_detect_phy_addr()`` is renamed to :cpp:func:`esp_eth_phy_802_3_detect_phy_addr` and its header declaration is moved to :component_file:`esp_eth/include/esp_eth_phy_802_3.h`.\\n\\n\\nSPI-Ethernet Module Initialization\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nThe SPI-Ethernet Module initialization is now simplified. Previously, you had to manually allocate an SPI device using :cpp:func:`spi_bus_add_device` before instantiating the SPI-Ethernet MAC.\\n\\nNow, you no longer need to call :cpp:func:`spi_bus_add_device` as SPI devices are allocated internally. As a result, the :cpp:class:`eth_dm9051_config_t`, :cpp:class:`eth_w5500_config_t`, and :cpp:class:`eth_ksz8851snl_config_t` configuration structures are updated to include members for SPI device configuration (e.g., to allow fine tuning of SPI timing which may be dependent on PCB design). Likewise, the ``ETH_DM9051_DEFAULT_CONFIG``, ``ETH_W5500_DEFAULT_CONFIG``, and ``ETH_KSZ8851SNL_DEFAULT_CONFIG`` configuration initialization macros are updated to accept new input parameters. Refer to :doc:`Ethernet API Reference Guide <../../../api-reference/network/esp_eth>` for an example of SPI-Ethernet Module initialization.\\n\\nEthernet Driver\\n---------------\\n\\nAPIs for creating MAC instances (`esp_eth_mac_new_*()`) have been reworked to accept two parameters, instead of one common configuration. Now, the configuration includes\\n\\n* Vendor specific MAC configuration\\n* Ethernet driver MAC configuration\\n\\nThis is applicable to internal Ethernet MAC :cpp:func:`esp_eth_mac_new_esp32()` as well as to external MAC devices, such as :cpp:func:`esp_eth_mac_new_ksz8851snl()`, :cpp:func:`esp_eth_mac_new_dm9051()`, and :cpp:func:`esp_eth_mac_new_w5500()`\\n\\n.. _tcpip-adapter:\\n\\nTCP/IP Adapter\\n*****************\\n\\nThe TCP/IP Adapter was a network interface abstraction component used in ESP-IDF prior to v4.1. This section outlines migration from ``tcpip_adapter`` API to its successor :doc:`/api-reference/network/esp_netif`.\\n\\n\\nUpdating Network Connection Code\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n\\nNetwork Stack Initialization\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- You may simply replace ``tcpip_adapter_init()`` with ``esp_netif_init()``. However, please should note that the ``esp_netif_init()`` function now returns standard error codes. See :doc:`/api-reference/network/esp_netif` for more details.\\n- The ``esp_netif_deinit()`` function is provided to de-initialize the network stack.\\n- You should also replace ``#include \"tcpip_adapter.h\"`` with ``#include \"esp_netif.h\"``.\\n\\n\\nNetwork Interface Creation\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nPreviously, the TCP/IP Adapter defined the following network interfaces statically:\\n\\n- WiFi Station\\n- WiFi Access Point\\n- Ethernet\\n\\nThis now changes. Network interface instance should be explicitly constructed, so that the :doc:`/api-reference/network/esp_netif` can connect to the TCP/IP stack. For example, after the TCP/IP stack and the event loop are initialized, the initialization code for WiFi must explicitly call ``esp_netif_create_default_wifi_sta();`` or ``esp_netif_create_default_wifi_ap();``.\\n\\nPlease refer to the example initialization code for these three interfaces:\\n\\n- WiFi Station: :example_file:`wifi/getting_started/station/main/station_example_main.c`\\n- WiFi Access Point: :example_file:`wifi/getting_started/softAP/main/softap_example_main.c`\\n- Ethernet: :example_file:`ethernet/basic/main/ethernet_example_main.c`\\n\\nOther ``tcpip_adapter`` API Replacement\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAll the ``tcpip_adapter`` functions have their ``esp-netif`` counter-part. Please refer to the ``esp_netif.h`` grouped into these sections:\\n\\n*  :component_file:`Setters/Getters <esp_netif/include/esp_netif.h#L241>`\\n*  :component_file:`DHCP <esp_netif/include/esp_netif.h#L387>`\\n*  :component_file:`DNS <esp_netif/include/esp_netif.h#L516>`\\n*  :component_file:`IP address <esp_netif/include/esp_netif.h#L568>`\\n\\nDefault Event Handlers\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nEvent handlers are moved from ``tcpip_adapter`` to appropriate driver code. There is no change from application code perspective, as all events should be handled in the same way. Please note that for IP-related event handlers, application code usually receives IP addresses in the form of an ``esp-netif`` specific struct instead of the LwIP structs. However, both structs are binary compatible.\\n\\n\\nThis is the preferred way to print the address:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    ESP_LOGI(TAG, \"got ip:\" IPSTR, IP2STR(&event->ip_info.ip));\\n\\nInstead of\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    ESP_LOGI(TAG, \"got ip:%s\", ip4addr_ntoa(&event->ip_info.ip));\\n\\nSince ``ip4addr_ntoa()`` is a LwIP API, the esp-netif provides ``esp_ip4addr_ntoa()`` as a replacement. However, the above method using ``IP2STR()`` is generally preferred.\\n\\nIP Addresses\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nYou are advised to use ``esp-netif`` defined IP structures. Please note that with default compatibility enabled, the LwIP structs still work.\\n\\n*  :component_file:`esp-netif IP address definitions <esp_netif/include/esp_netif_ip_addr.h#L96>`\\n',\n",

Users that need to port their code from GCC 8.4.0 to 11.2.0 should refer to the series of official GCC porting guides listed below:\\n\\n* `Porting to GCC 9 <https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-9/porting_to.html>`_\\n* `Porting to GCC 10 <https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/porting_to.html>`_\\n* `Porting to GCC 11 <https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-11/porting_to.html>`_\\n\\n\\nWarnings\\n========\\n\\nThe upgrade to GCC 11.2.0 has resulted in the addition of new warnings, or enhancements to existing warnings. The full details of all GCC warnings can be found in `GCC Warning Options <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-11.2.0/gcc/Warning-Options.html>`_. Users are advised to double-check their code, then fix the warnings if possible. Unfortunately, depending on the warning and the complexity of the user\\'s code, some warnings will be false positives that require non-trivial fixes. In such cases, users can choose to suppress the warning in multiple ways. This section outlines some common warnings that users are likely to encounter, and ways to suppress them.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    Users are advised to check that a warning is indeed a false positive before attempting to suppress them it.\\n\\n\\n``-Wstringop-overflow``, ``-Wstringop-overread``, ``-Wstringop-truncation``, and ``-Warray-bounds``\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUsers that use memory/string copy/compare functions will run into one of the ``-Wstringop`` warnings if the compiler cannot properly determine the size of the memory/string. The examples below demonstrate code that triggers these warnings and how to suppress them.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    #pragma GCC diagnostic push\\n    #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored \"-Wstringop-overflow\"\\n    #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored \"-Warray-bounds\"\\n        memset(RTC_SLOW_MEM, 0, CONFIG_ULP_COPROC_RESERVE_MEM); // <<-- This line leads to warnings\\n    #pragma GCC diagnostic pop\\n\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    #pragma GCC diagnostic push\\n    #if     __GNUC__ >= 11\\n    #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored \"-Wstringop-overread\" // <<-- This key had been introduced since GCC 11\\n    #endif\\n    #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored \"-Warray-bounds\"\\n                memcpy(backup_write_data, (void *)EFUSE_PGM_DATA0_REG, sizeof(backup_write_data)); // <<-- This line leads to warnings\\n    #pragma GCC diagnostic pop\\n\\n\\n``-Waddress-of-packed-member``\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nGCC will issue this warning when accessing an unaligned member of a packed ``struct`` due to the incurred penalty of unaligned memory access. However, all ESP chips (on both Xtensa and RISC-V architectures) allow for unaligned memory access and incur no extra penalty. Thus, this warning can be ignored in most cases.\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    components/bt/host/bluedroid/btc/profile/std/gatt/btc_gatt_util.c: In function \\'btc_to_bta_gatt_id\\':\\n    components/bt/host/bluedroid/btc/profile/std/gatt/btc_gatt_util.c:105:21: warning: taking address of packed member of \\'struct <anonymous>\\' may result in an unaligned pointer value [-Waddress-of-packed-member]\\n      105 |     btc_to_bta_uuid(&p_dest->uuid, &p_src->uuid);\\n          |                     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n\\nIf the warning occurs in multiple places across multiple source files, users can suppress the warning at the CMake level as demonstrated below.\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n    set_source_files_properties(\\n        \"host/bluedroid/bta/gatt/bta_gattc_act.c\"\\n        \"host/bluedroid/bta/gatt/bta_gattc_cache.c\"\\n        \"host/bluedroid/btc/profile/std/gatt/btc_gatt_util.c\"\\n        \"host/bluedroid/btc/profile/std/gatt/btc_gatts.c\"\\n        PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS -Wno-address-of-packed-member)\\n\\nHowever, if there are only one or two instances, users can suppress the warning directly in the source code itself as demonstrated below.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    #pragma GCC diagnostic push\\n    #if     __GNUC__ >= 9\\n    #pragma GCC diagnostic ignored \"-Waddress-of-packed-member\" <<-- This key had been introduced since GCC 9\\n    #endif\\n        uint32_t* reg_ptr = (uint32_t*)src;\\n    #pragma GCC diagnostic pop\\n\\n\\n``llabs()`` for 64-bit Integers\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nThe function ``abs()`` from stdlib.h takes ``int`` argument. Please use ``llabs()`` for types that are intended to be 64-bit. It is particularly important for ``time_t``.\\n\\n\\nEspressif Toolchain Changes\\n===========================\\n\\n``int32_t`` and ``uint32_t`` for Xtensa Compiler\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe types ``int32_t`` and ``uint32_t`` have been changed from the previous ``int`` and ``unsigned int`` to ``long`` and ``unsigned long`` respectively for the Xtensa compiler. This change now matches upstream GCC which ``long`` integers for ``int32_t`` and ``uint32_t`` on Xtensa, RISC-V, and other architectures.\\n\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n   :widths: 20 45 35\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n\\n   * -\\n     - 2021r2 and older, GCC 8\\n     - 2022r1, GCC 11\\n   * - Xtensa\\n     - (unsigned) int\\n     - (unsigned) long\\n   * - riscv32\\n     - (unsigned) long\\n     - (unsigned) long\\n\\n\\nThe change mostly affects code that formats strings using types provided by ``<inttypes.h>``. When using these fixed-width types (e.g., ``uint32_t``), users will need to replace placeholders such as ``%i`` and ``%x`` with ``PRIi32`` and ``PRIx32`` respectively. Types *not* defined in ``<inttypes.h>`` (e.g., ``int``) do *not* need this special formatting.\\n\\nIn other cases, it should be noted that enums have the ``int`` type.\\n\\nIn common, ``int32_t`` and ``int``, as well as ``uint32_t`` and ``unsigned int``, are different types.\\n\\nIf users do not make the aforementioned updates to format strings in their applications, the following error will be reported during compilation:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    /Users/name/esp/esp-rainmaker/components/esp-insights/components/esp_diagnostics/include/esp_diagnostics.h:238:29: error: format \\'%u\\' expects argument of type \\'unsigned int\\', but argument 3 has type \\'uint32_t\\' {aka \\'long unsigned int\\'} [-Werror=format=]\\n    238 |     esp_diag_log_event(tag, \"EV (%u) %s: \" format, esp_log_timestamp(), tag, ##__VA_ARGS__); \\\\\\n        |                             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n        |                                                    |\\n        |                                                    uint32_t {aka long unsigned int}\\n                                                  uint32_t {aka long unsigned int}\\n\\nRemoving ``CONFIG_COMPILER_DISABLE_GCC8_WARNINGS`` Build Option\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n``CONFIG_COMPILER_DISABLE_GCC8_WARNINGS`` option was introduced to allow building of legacy code dating from the rigid GCC 5 toolchain. However, enough time has passed to allow for the warnings to be fixed, thus this option has been removed.\\n\\nFor now in GCC 11, users are advised to review their code and fix the compiler warnings where possible.\\n',\n",
       " 'Tools\\n=====\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nESP-IDF Monitor\\n---------------\\n\\nESP-IDF Monitor makes the following changes regarding baud-rate:\\n\\n- ESP-IDF monitor now uses the custom console baud-rate (:ref:`CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_UART_BAUDRATE`) by default instead of 115200.\\n- Setting a custom baud from menuconfig is no longer supported.\\n- A custom baud-rate can be specified from command line with the ``idf.py monitor -b <baud>`` command or through setting environment variables.\\n- Please note that the baud-rate argument has been renamed from ``-B`` to ``-b`` in order to be consistent with the global baud-rate ``idf.py -b <baud>``. Run ``idf.py monitor --help`` for more information.\\n\\nDeprecated Commands\\n-------------------\\n\\n``idf.py`` sub-commands and ``cmake`` target names have been unified to use hyphens (``-``) instead of underscores (``_``). Using a deprecated sub-command or target name will produce a warning. Users are advised to migrate to using the new sub-commands and target names. The following changes have been made:\\n\\n.. list-table:: Deprecated Sub-command and Target Names\\n   :widths: 50 50\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n\\n   * - Old Name\\n     - New Name\\n   * - efuse_common_table\\n     - efuse-common-table\\n   * - efuse_custom_table\\n     - efuse-custom-table\\n   * - erase_flash\\n     - erase-flash\\n   * - partition_table\\n     - partition-table\\n   * - partition_table-flash\\n     - partition-table-flash\\n   * - post_debug\\n     - post-debug\\n   * - show_efuse_table\\n     - show-efuse-table\\n   * - erase_otadata\\n     - erase-otadata\\n   * - read_otadata\\n     - read-otadata\\n\\nEsptool\\n-------\\n\\nThe ``CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE_DETECT`` option has been renamed to :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_HEADER_FLASHSIZE_UPDATE` and has been disabled by default. New and existing projects migrated to ESP-IDF v5.0 have to set :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE`. If this is not possible due to an unknown flash size at build time, then :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_HEADER_FLASHSIZE_UPDATE` can be enabled. However, once enabled, to keep the digest valid, an SHA256 digest is no longer appended to the image when updating the binary header with the flash size during flashing.\\n\\nWindows Environment\\n--------------------\\n\\nThe Msys/Mingw-based Windows environment support got deprecated in ESP-IDF v4.0 and was entirely removed in v5.0. Please use :ref:`get-started-windows-tools-installer` to set up a compatible environment. The options include Windows Command Line, Power Shell and the graphical user interface based on Eclipse IDE. In addition, a VS Code-based environment can be set up with the supported plugin: https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension.\\n',\n",
       " 'System\\n======\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nInter-Processor Call\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIPC (Inter-Processor Call) feature is no longer a stand-alone component and has been integrated into the ``esp_system`` component.\\n\\nThus, any project presenting a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file with the parameters ``PRIV_REQUIRES esp_ipc`` or ``REQUIRES esp_ipc`` should be modified to simply remove these options as the ``esp_system`` component is included by default.\\n\\nESP Clock\\n---------\\n\\nThe ESP Clock API (functions/types/macros prefixed with ``esp_clk``) has been made into a private API. Thus, the previous include paths ``#include \"{IDF_TARGET_NAME}/clk.h\"`` and ``#include \"esp_clk.h\"`` have been removed. If users still require usage of the ESP Clock API (though this is not recommended), it can be included via  ``#include \"esp_private/esp_clk.h\"``.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Private APIs are not stable and no are longer subject to the ESP-IDF versioning scheme\\'s breaking change rules. Thus, it is not recommended for users to continue calling private APIs in their applications.\\n\\nCache Error Interrupt\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe Cache Error Interrupt API (functions/types/macros prefixed with ``esp_cache_err``) has been made into a private API. Thus, the previous include path ``#include \"{IDF_TARGET_NAME}/cache_err_int.h\"`` has been removed. If users still require usage of the Cache Error Interrupt API (though this is not recommended), it can be included via  ``#include \"esp_private/cache_err_int.h\"``.\\n\\n``bootloader_support``\\n----------------------\\n\\n* The function ``bootloader_common_get_reset_reason()`` has been removed. Please use the function ``esp_rom_get_reset_reason()`` in the ROM component.\\n* The functions ``esp_secure_boot_verify_sbv2_signature_block()`` and ``esp_secure_boot_verify_rsa_signature_block()`` have been removed without replacement. We do not expect users to use these directly. If they are indeed still neccessary, please open a feature request on `GitHub <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/new/choose>`_ explaining why these functions are necessary to you.\\n\\nBrownout\\n--------\\n\\nThe Brownout API (functions/types/macros prefixed with ``esp_brownout``) has been made into a private API. Thus, the previous include path ``#include \"brownout.h\"`` has been removed. If users still require usage of the Brownout API (though this is not recommended), it can be included via  ``#include \"esp_private/brownout.h\"``.\\n\\nTrax\\n----\\n\\nThe Trax API (functions/types/macros prefixed with ``trax_``) has been made into a private API. Thus, the previous include path ``#include \"trax.h\"`` has been removed. If users still require usage of the Trax API (though this is not recommended), it can be included via  ``#include \"esp_private/trax.h\"``.\\n\\nROM\\n---\\n\\nThe previously deprecated ROM-related header files located in ``components/esp32/rom/`` (old include path: ``rom/*.h``) have been moved. Please use the new target-specific path from ``components/esp_rom/include/{IDF_TARGET_NAME}/`` (new include path: ``{IDF_TARGET_NAME}/rom/*.h``).\\n\\n``esp_hw_support``\\n------------------\\n\\n- The header files ``soc/cpu.h`` have been deleted and deprecated CPU util functions have been removed. ESP-IDF developers should include ``esp_cpu.h`` instead for equivalent functions.\\n- The header files ``hal/cpu_ll.h``, ``hal/cpu_hal.h``, ``hal/soc_ll.h``, ``hal/soc_hal.h`` and ``interrupt_controller_hal.h`` CPU API functions have been deprecated. ESP-IDF developers should include ``esp_cpu.h`` instead for equivalent functions.\\n- The header file ``compare_set.h`` have been deleted. ESP-IDF developers should use ``esp_cpu_compare_and_set()`` function provided in ``esp_cpu.h`` instead.\\n- ``esp_cpu_get_ccount()``, ``esp_cpu_set_ccount()`` and ``esp_cpu_in_ocd_debug_mode()`` were removed from ``esp_cpu.h``. ESP-IDF developers should use respectively ``esp_cpu_get_cycle_count()``, ``esp_cpu_set_cycle_count()`` and ``esp_cpu_dbgr_is_attached()`` instead.\\n- The header file ``esp_intr.h`` has been deleted. Please include ``esp_intr_alloc.h`` to allocate and manipulate interrupts.\\n- The Panic API (functions/types/macros prefixed with ``esp_panic``) has been made into a private API. Thus, the previous include path ``#include \"esp_panic.h\"`` has been removed. If users still require usage of the Trax API (though this is not recommended), it can be included via  ``#include \"esp_private/panic_reason.h\"``. Besides, developers should include ``esp_debug_helpers.h`` instead to use any debug-related helper functions, e.g., print backtrace.\\n- The header file ``soc_log.h`` is now renamed to ``esp_hw_log.h`` and has been made private. Users are encouraged to use logging APIs provided under ``esp_log.h`` instead.\\n- The header files ``spinlock.h``, ``clk_ctrl_os.h``, and ``rtc_wdt.h`` must now be included without the ``soc`` prefix. For example, ``#include \"spinlock.h\"``.\\n- ``esp_chip_info()`` returns the chip version in the format  = 100 * ``major eFuse version`` + ``minor eFuse version``. Thus, the ``revision`` in the ``esp_chip_info_t`` structure is expanded to ``uint16_t`` to fit the new format.\\n\\nPSRAM\\n^^^^^\\n\\n- The target-specific header file ``spiram.h`` and the header file ``esp_spiram.h`` have been removed. A new component ``esp_psram`` is created instead. For PSRAM/SPIRAM-related functions, users now include ``esp_psram.h`` and set the ``esp_psram`` component as a component requirement in their ``CMakeLists.txt`` project files.\\n- ``esp_spiram_get_chip_size`` and ``esp_spiram_get_size`` have been deleted. You should use ``esp_psram_get_size`` instead.\\n\\neFuse\\n----------\\n\\n- The parameter type of function ``esp_secure_boot_read_key_digests()`` changed from ``ets_secure_boot_key_digests_t*`` to ``esp_secure_boot_key_digests_t*``. The new type is the same as the old one, except that the ``allow_key_revoke`` flag has been removed. The latter was always set to ``true`` in current code, not providing additional information.\\n- Added eFuse wafer revisions: major and minor. The ``esp_efuse_get_chip_ver()`` API is not compatible with these changes, so it was removed. Instead, please use the following APIs: ``efuse_hal_get_major_chip_version()``, ``efuse_hal_get_minor_chip_version()`` or ``efuse_hal_chip_revision()``.\\n\\n``esp_common``\\n--------------\\n\\n``EXT_RAM_ATTR`` is deprecated. Use the new macro ``EXT_RAM_BSS_ATTR`` to put ``.bss`` on PSRAM.\\n\\n``esp_system``\\n--------------\\n\\n- The header files ``esp_random.h``, ``esp_mac.h``, and ``esp_chip_info.h``, which were all previously indirectly included via the header file ``esp_system.h``, must now be included directly. These indirect inclusions from ``esp_system.h`` have been removed.\\n- The Backtrace Parser API (functions/types/macros prefixed with ``esp_eh_frame_``) has been made into a private API. Thus, the previous include path ``#include \"eh_frame_parser.h\"`` has been removed. If users still require usage of the Backtrace Parser API (though this is not recommended), it can be included via ``#include \"esp_private/eh_frame_parser.h\"``.\\n- The Interrupt Watchdog API (functions/types/macros prefixed with ``esp_int_wdt_``) has been made into a private API. Thus, the previous include path ``#include \"esp_int_wdt.h\"`` has been removed. If users still require usage of the Interrupt Watchdog API (though this is not recommended), it can be included via  ``#include \"esp_private/esp_int_wdt.h\"``.\\n\\nSoC Dependency\\n--------------\\n\\n- Public API headers listed in the Doxyfiles will not expose unstable and unnecessary SoC header files, such as ``soc/soc.h`` and ``soc/rtc.h``. That means the user has to explicitly include them in their code if these \"missing\" header files are still wanted.\\n- Kconfig option ``LEGACY_INCLUDE_COMMON_HEADERS`` is also removed.\\n- The header file ``soc/soc_memory_types.h`` has been deprecated. Users should use the ``esp_memory_utils.h`` instead. Including ``soc/soc_memory_types.h`` will bring a build warning like ``soc_memory_types.h is deprecated, please migrate to esp_memory_utils.h``\\n\\nAPP Trace\\n---------\\n\\nOne of the timestamp sources has changed from the legacy timer group driver to the new :doc:`GPTimer <../../../api-reference/peripherals/gptimer>`. Kconfig choices like ``APPTRACE_SV_TS_SOURCE_TIMER00`` has been changed to ``APPTRACE_SV_TS_SOURCE_GPTIMER``. User no longer need to choose the group and timer ID.\\n\\n``esp_timer``\\n-------------\\n\\nThe FRC2-based legacy implementation of ``esp_timer`` available on ESP32 has been removed. The simpler and more efficient implementation based on the LAC timer is now the only option.\\n\\nESP Image\\n---------\\n\\nThe image SPI speed enum definitions have been renamed.\\n\\n- Enum ``ESP_IMAGE_SPI_SPEED_80M`` has been renamed to ``ESP_IMAGE_SPI_SPEED_DIV_1``.\\n- Enum ``ESP_IMAGE_SPI_SPEED_40M`` has been renamed to ``ESP_IMAGE_SPI_SPEED_DIV_2``.\\n- Enum ``ESP_IMAGE_SPI_SPEED_26M`` has been renamed to ``ESP_IMAGE_SPI_SPEED_DIV_3``.\\n- Enum ``ESP_IMAGE_SPI_SPEED_20M`` has been renamed to ``ESP_IMAGE_SPI_SPEED_DIV_4``.\\n\\nTask Watchdog Timers\\n--------------------\\n\\n- The API for ``esp_task_wdt_init()`` has changed as follows:\\n\\n    - Configuration is now passed as a configuration structure.\\n    - The function will now handle subscribing of the idle tasks if configured to do so.\\n\\n- The former ``CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT`` configuration option has been renamed to :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_INIT` and a new :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_EN` option has been introduced.\\n\\nFreeRTOS\\n--------\\n\\nLegacy API and Data Types\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nPreviously, the ``configENABLE_BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY`` option was set by default, thus allowing pre FreeRTOS v8.0.0 function names and data types to be used. The ``configENABLE_BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY`` is now disabled by default, thus legacy FreeRTOS names/types are no longer supportd by default. Users should do one of the followings:\\n\\n- Update their code to remove usage of legacy FreeRTOS names/types.\\n- Enable the :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_ENABLE_BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY` to explicitly allow the usage of legacy names/types.\\n\\nTasks Snapshot\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe header ``task_snapshot.h`` has been removed from ``freertos/task.h``. ESP-IDF developers should include ``freertos/task_snapshot.h`` if they need tasks snapshot API.\\n\\nThe function :cpp:func:`vTaskGetSnapshot` now returns ``BaseType_t``. Return value shall be ``pdTRUE`` on success and ``pdFALSE`` otherwise.\\n\\nFreeRTOS Asserts\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nPreviously, FreeRTOS asserts were configured separately from the rest of the system using the ``FREERTOS_ASSERT`` kconfig option. This option has now been removed and the configuration is now done through ``COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_ASSERTION_LEVEL``.\\n\\nPort Macro API\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe file ``portmacro_deprecated.h`` which was added to maintain backward compatibility for deprecated APIs is removed. Users are advised to use the alternate functions for the deprecated APIs as listed below:\\n\\n- ``portENTER_CRITICAL_NESTED()`` is removed. Users should use the ``portSET_INTERRUPT_MASK_FROM_ISR()`` macro instead.\\n- ``portEXIT_CRITICAL_NESTED()`` is removed. Users should use the ``portCLEAR_INTERRUPT_MASK_FROM_ISR()`` macro instead.\\n- ``vPortCPUInitializeMutex()`` is removed. Users should use the ``spinlock_initialize()`` function instead.\\n- ``vPortCPUAcquireMutex()`` is removed. Users should use the ``spinlock_acquire()`` function instead.\\n- ``vPortCPUAcquireMutexTimeout()`` is removed. Users should use the ``spinlock_acquire()`` function instead.\\n- ``vPortCPUReleaseMutex()`` is removed. Users should use the ``spinlock_release()`` function instead.\\n\\nApp Update\\n----------\\n\\n- The functions :cpp:func:`esp_ota_get_app_description` and :cpp:func:`esp_ota_get_app_elf_sha256` have been termed as deprecated. Please use the alternative functions :cpp:func:`esp_app_get_description` and :cpp:func:`esp_app_get_elf_sha256` respectively. These functions have now been moved to a new component :component:`esp_app_format`. Please refer to the header file :component_file:`esp_app_desc.h <esp_app_format/include/esp_app_desc.h>`.\\n\\nBootloader Support\\n------------------\\n\\n- The :cpp:type:`esp_app_desc_t` structure, which used to be declared in :component_file:`esp_app_format.h <bootloader_support/include/esp_app_format.h>`, is now declared in :component_file:`esp_app_desc.h <esp_app_format/include/esp_app_desc.h>`.\\n\\n- The function :cpp:func:`bootloader_common_get_partition_description` has now been made private. Please use the alternative function :cpp:func:`esp_ota_get_partition_description`.

As the DHE_PSK/DHE_RSA ciphers have now been disabled by the above change, the server would fall back to an alternative cipher; if in a rare case, it does not support any other cipher, the handshake would fail. To retrieve the list of ciphers supported by the server, one must attempt to connect with the server with a specific cipher from the client-side.

However, users should also exclude the legacy ``freemodbus`` component from the build. This can be achieved using the statement below in the project\\'s ``CMakeLists.txt``:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n  set(EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS freemodbus)\\n',\n",
       " 'Storage\\n=======\\n\\nNew Component for the Partition APIs\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nBreaking change: all the Partition API code has been moved to a new component :component:`esp_partition`. For the complete list of affected functions and data-types, see header file :component_file:`esp_partition.h <esp_partition/include/esp_partition.h>`.\\n\\nThese API functions and data-types were previously a part of the :component:`spi_flash` component, and thus possible dependencies on the ``spi_flash`` in existing applications may cause the build failure, in case of direct esp_partition_* APIs/data-types use (for instance, ``fatal error: esp_partition.h: No such file or directory`` at lines with ``#include \"esp_partition.h\"``). If you encounter such an issue, please update your project\\'s CMakeLists.txt file as follows:\\n\\nOriginal dependency setup:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n   idf_component_register(...\\n                          REQUIRES spi_flash)\\n\\nUpdated dependency setup:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n   idf_component_register(...\\n                          REQUIRES spi_flash esp_partition)\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   Please update relevant ``REQUIRES`` or ``PRIV_REQUIRES`` section according to your project. The above-presented code snippet is just an example.\\n\\nIf the issue persists, please let us know and we will assist you with your code migration.\\n\\n\\nSDMMC/SDSPI\\n-----------\\n\\nSD card frequency on SDMMC/SDSPI interface can be now configured through ``sdmmc_host_t.max_freq_khz`` to a specific value, not only ``SDMMC_FREQ_PROBING`` (400 kHz), ``SDMMC_FREQ_DEFAULT`` (20 MHz), or ``SDMMC_FREQ_HIGHSPEED`` (40 MHz). Previously, in case you have specified a custom frequency other than any of the above-mentioned values, the closest lower-or-equal one was selected anyway.\\n\\nNow, the underlaying drivers calculate the nearest fitting value, given by available frequency dividers instead of an enumeration item selection. This could cause troubles in communication with your SD card without a change of the existing application code.If you encounter such an issue, please, keep trying different frequencies around your desired value unless you find the one working well. To check the frequency value calculated and actually applied, use ``void sdmmc_card_print_info(FILE* stream, const sdmmc_card_t* card)`` function.\\n\\nFatFs\\n-----\\n\\nFatFs is now updated to v0.14. As a result, the function signature of ``f_mkfs()`` has changed. The new signature is ``FRESULT f_mkfs (const TCHAR* path, const MKFS_PARM* opt, void* work, UINT len);`` which uses ``MKFS_PARM`` struct as a second argument.\\n\\nPartition Table\\n---------------\\n\\nThe partition table generator no longer supports misaligned partitions. When generating a partition table, ``ESP-IDF`` only accepts partitions with offsets that align to 4 KB. This change only affects generating new partition tables. Reading and writing to already existing partitions remains unchanged.\\n\\n\\nVFS\\n---\\n\\nThe ``esp_vfs_semihost_register()`` function signature is changed as follows:\\n\\n- The new signature is ``esp_err_t esp_vfs_semihost_register(const char* base_path);``\\n- The ``host_path`` parameter of the old signature no longer exists. Instead, the OpenOCD command ``ESP_SEMIHOST_BASEDIR`` should be used to set the full path on the host.\\n\\nFunction Signature Changes\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe following functions now return ``esp_err_t`` instead of ``void`` or ``nvs_iterator_t``. Previously, when parameters were invalid or when something goes wrong internally, these functions would ``assert()`` or return a ``nullptr``. With an ``esp_err_t`` returned, you can get better error reporting.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`nvs_entry_find`\\n- :cpp:func:`nvs_entry_next`\\n- :cpp:func:`nvs_entry_info`\\n\\nBecause the ``esp_err_t`` return type changes, the usage patterns of ``nvs_entry_find()`` and ``nvs_entry_next()`` become different. Both functions now modify iterators via parameters instead of returning an iterator.\\n\\nThe old programming pattern to iterate over an NVS partition was as follows:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    nvs_iterator_t it = nvs_entry_find(<nvs_partition_name>, <namespace>, NVS_TYPE_ANY);\\n    while (it != NULL) {\\n            nvs_entry_info_t info;\\n            nvs_entry_info(it, &info);\\n            it = nvs_entry_next(it);\\n            printf(\"key \\'%s\\', type \\'%d\\'\", info.key, info.type);\\n    };\\n\\nThe new programming pattern to iterate over an NVS partition is now:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    nvs_iterator_t it = nullptr;\\n    esp_err_t res = nvs_entry_find(<nvs_partition_name>, <namespace>, NVS_TYPE_ANY, &it);\\n    while(res == ESP_OK) {\\n        nvs_entry_info_t info;\\n        nvs_entry_info(it, &info); // Can omit error check if parameters are guaranteed to be non-NULL\\n        printf(\"key \\'%s\\', type \\'%d\\'\", info.key, info.type);\\n        res = nvs_entry_next(&it);\\n    }\\n    nvs_release_iterator(it);\\n\\nIterator Validity\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nNote that because the function signature changes, if there is a parameter error, you may get an invalid iterator from ``nvs_entry_find()``. Hence, it is important to initialize the iterator to ``NULL`` before using ``nvs_entry_find()``, so that you can avoid complex error checking before calling ``nvs_release_iterator()``. A good example is the programming pattern above.\\n\\n\\nRemoved SDSPI Deprecated API\\n----------------------------\\n\\nStructure ``sdspi_slot_config_t`` and function ``sdspi_host_init_slot()`` are removed, and replaced by structure ``sdspi_device_config_t`` and function ``sdspi_host_init_device()`` respectively.\\n\\nROM SPI Flash\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn versions before v5.0, ROM SPI flash functions were included via ``esp32**/rom/spi_flash.h``. Thus, code written to support different ESP chips might be filled with ROM headers of different targets. Furthermore, not all of the APIs could be used on all ESP chips.\\n\\nNow, the common APIs are extracted to ``esp_rom_spiflash.h``. Although it is not a breaking change, you are strongly recommended to only use the functions from this header (i.e., prefixed with ``esp_rom_spiflash`` and included by ``esp_rom_spiflash.h``) for better cross-compatibility between ESP chips.\\n\\nTo make ROM SPI flash APIs clearer, the following functions are also renamed:\\n\\n- ``esp_rom_spiflash_lock()`` to ``esp_rom_spiflash_set_bp()``\\n- ``esp_rom_spiflash_unlock()`` to ``esp_rom_spiflash_clear_bp()``\\n\\nSPI Flash Driver\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe ``esp_flash_speed_t`` ``enum`` type is now deprecated. Instead, you may now directly pass the real clock frequency value to the flash configuration structure. The following example demonstrates how to configure a flash frequency of 80MHz:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    esp_flash_spi_device_config_t dev_cfg = {\\n        // Other members\\n        .freq_mhz = 80,\\n        // Other members\\n    };\\n\\nLegacy SPI Flash Driver\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTo make SPI flash drivers more stable, the legacy SPI flash driver is removed from v5.0. The legacy SPI flash driver refers to default spi_flash driver since v3.0, and the SPI flash driver with configuration option ``CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_USE_LEGACY_IMPL`` enabled since v4.0. The major breaking change here is that the legacy spi_flash driver is no longer supported from v5.0. Therefore, the legacy driver APIs and the ``CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_USE_LEGACY_IMPL`` configuration option are both removed.

However, if users still would like to use the include path of the legacy driver, users should add ``esp_adc`` component to the list of component requirements in CMakeLists.txt.\\n\\nAttempting to use the legacy include path ``esp_adc_cal.h`` triggers the build warning below by default.

This would lead to the driver triggering a runtime error if an unsupported value is used.\\n\\n    - Enum ``ADC_CHANNEL_MAX``\\n    - Enum ``ADC_ATTEN_MAX``\\n    - Enum ``ADC_CONV_UNIT_MAX``\\n\\n- API ``hall_sensor_read`` on ESP32 has been removed. Hall sensor is no longer supported on ESP32.\\n- API ``adc_set_i2s_data_source`` and ``adc_i2s_mode_init`` have been deprecated. Related enum ``adc_i2s_source_t`` has been deprecated. Please migrate to use ``esp_adc/adc_continuous.h``.\\n- API ``adc_digi_filter_reset``, ``adc_digi_filter_set_config``, ``adc_digi_filter_get_config`` and ``adc_digi_filter_enable`` have been removed. These APIs behaviours are not guaranteed. Enum ``adc_digi_filter_idx_t``, ``adc_digi_filter_mode_t`` and structure ``adc_digi_iir_filter_t`` have been removed as well.\\n- API ``esp_adc_cal_characterize`` has been deprecated, please migrate to ``adc_cali_create_scheme_curve_fitting`` or ``adc_cali_create_scheme_line_fitting`` instead.\\n- API ``esp_adc_cal_raw_to_voltage`` has been deprecated, please migrate to ``adc_cali_raw_to_voltage`` instead.\\n- API ``esp_adc_cal_get_voltage`` has been deprecated, please migrate to ``adc_oneshot_get_calibrated_result`` instead.\\n\\nGPIO\\n----\\n\\n- The previous Kconfig option `RTCIO_SUPPORT_RTC_GPIO_DESC` has been removed, thus the ``rtc_gpio_desc`` array is unavailable. Please use ``rtc_io_desc`` array instead.\\n\\n- The user callback of a GPIO interrupt should no longer read the GPIO interrupt status register to get the GPIO\\'s pin number of triggering the interrupt. You should use the callback argument to determine the GPIO\\'s pin number instead.\\n\\n    - Previously, when a GPIO interrupt occurs, the GPIO\\'s interrupt status register is cleared after calling the user callbacks. Thus, it was possible for users to read the GPIO\\'s interrupt status register inside the callback to determine which GPIO was used to trigger the interrupt.\\n    - However, clearing the interrupt status register after calling the user callbacks can potentially cause edge-triggered interrupts to be lost. For example, if an edge-triggered interrupt is triggered/retriggered while the user callbacks are being called, that interrupt will be cleared without its registered user callback being handled.\\n    - Now, the GPIO\\'s interrupt status register is cleared **before** invoking the user callbacks. Thus, users can no longer read the GPIO interrupt status register to determine which pin has triggered the interrupt. Instead, users should use the callback argument to pass the pin number.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SDM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Sigma-Delta Modulator\\n    ---------------------\\n\\n    The Sigma-Delta Modulator driver has been redesigned into :doc:`SDM <../../../api-reference/peripherals/sdm>`.\\n\\n    - The new driver implements a factory pattern, where the SDM channels are managed in a pool internally, thus users do not have to fix a SDM channel to a GPIO manually.\\n    - All SDM channels can be allocated dynamically.\\n\\n    Although it is recommended to use the new driver APIs, the legacy driver is still available in the previous include path ``driver/sigmadelta.h``. However, by default, including ``driver/sigmadelta.h`` triggers the build warning below. The warning can be suppressed by Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_SDM_SUPPRESS_DEPRECATE_WARN`.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: text\\n\\n        The legacy sigma-delta driver is deprecated, please use driver/sdm.h\\n\\n    The major breaking changes in concept and usage are listed as follows:\\n\\n    Breaking Changes in Concepts\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    - SDM channel representation has changed from ``sigmadelta_channel_t`` to :cpp:type:`sdm_channel_handle_t`, which is an opaque pointer.\\n    - SDM channel configurations are stored in :cpp:type:`sdm_config_t` now, instead the previous ``sigmadelta_config_t``.\\n    - In the legacy driver, users do not have to set the clock source for SDM channel. But in the new driver, users need to set a proper one in the :cpp:member:`sdm_config_t::clk_src`. The available clock sources are listed in the :cpp:type:`soc_periph_sdm_clk_src_t`.\\n    - In the legacy driver, users need to set a ``prescale`` for the channel, which reflects the frequency in which the modulator outputs a pulse. In the new driver, users should use :cpp:member:`sdm_config_t::sample_rate_hz` to set the over sample rate.\\n    - In the legacy driver, users set ``duty`` to decide the output analog value, it is now renamed to a more appropriate name ``density``.\\n\\n    Breaking Changes in Usage\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    - Channel configuration was done by channel allocation, in :cpp:func:`sdm_new_channel`. In the new driver, only the ``density`` can be changed at runtime, by :cpp:func:`sdm_channel_set_pulse_density`. Other parameters like ``gpio number`` and ``prescale`` are only allowed to set during channel allocation.\\n    - Before further channel operations, users should **enable** the channel in advance, by calling :cpp:func:`sdm_channel_enable`. This function helps to manage some system level services, like **Power Management**.\\n\\nTimer Group Driver\\n------------------\\n\\nTimer Group driver has been redesigned into :doc:`GPTimer <../../../api-reference/peripherals/gptimer>`, which aims to unify and simplify the usage of general purpose timer.\\n\\nAlthough it is recommended to use the new driver APIs, the legacy driver is still available in the previous include path ``driver/timer.h``. However, by default, including ``driver/timer.h`` triggers the build warning below. The warning can be suppressed by the Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_GPTIMER_SUPPRESS_DEPRECATE_WARN`.\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n    legacy timer group driver is deprecated, please migrate to driver/gptimer.h\\n\\nThe major breaking changes in concept and usage are listed as follows:\\n\\nBreaking Changes in Concepts\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n-  ``timer_group_t`` and ``timer_idx_t`` which used to identify the hardware timer are removed from user\\'s code. In the new driver, a timer is represented by :cpp:type:`gptimer_handle_t`.\\n-  Definition of timer clock source is moved to :cpp:type:`gptimer_clock_source_t`, the previous ``timer_src_clk_t`` is not used.\\n-  Definition of timer count direction is moved to :cpp:type:`gptimer_count_direction_t`, the previous ``timer_count_dir_t`` is not used.\\n-  Only level interrupt is supported, ``timer_intr_t`` and ``timer_intr_mode_t`` are not used.\\n-  Auto-reload is enabled by set the :cpp:member:`gptimer_alarm_config_t::auto_reload_on_alarm` flag. ``timer_autoreload_t`` is not used.\\n\\nBreaking Changes in Usage\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n-  Timer initialization is done by creating a timer instance from :cpp:func:`gptimer_new_timer`. Basic configurations like clock source, resolution and direction should be set in :cpp:type:`gptimer_config_t`. Note that, specific configurations of alarm events are not needed during the installation stage of the driver.\\n-  Alarm event is configured by :cpp:func:`gptimer_set_alarm_action`, with parameters set in the :cpp:type:`gptimer_alarm_config_t`.\\n-  Setting and getting count value are done by :cpp:func:`gptimer_get_raw_count` and :cpp:func:`gptimer_set_raw_count`. The driver does not help convert the raw value into UTC time-stamp. Instead, the conversion should be done from user\\'s side as the timer resolution is also known to the user.\\n-  The driver will install the interrupt service as well if :cpp:member:`gptimer_event_callbacks_t::on_alarm` is set to a valid callback function. In the callback, users do not have to deal with the low level registers (like \"clear interrupt status\", \"re-enable alarm event\" and so on). So functions like ``timer_group_get_intr_status_in_isr`` and ``timer_group_get_auto_reload_in_isr`` are not used anymore.\\n-  To update the alarm configurations when alarm event happens, one can call :cpp:func:`gptimer_set_alarm_action` in the interrupt callback, then the alarm will be re-enabled again.\\n-  Alarm will always be re-enabled by the driver if :cpp:member:`gptimer_alarm_config_t::auto_reload_on_alarm` is set to true.\\n\\nUART\\n----\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :width: 700 px\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Removed/Deprecated items\\n      - Replacement\\n      - Remarks\\n    * - ``uart_isr_register()``\\n      - None\\n      - UART interrupt handling is implemented by driver itself.\\n    * - ``uart_isr_free()``\\n      - None\\n      - UART interrupt handling is implemented by driver itself.\\n    * - ``use_ref_tick`` in :cpp:type:`uart_config_t`\\n      - :cpp:member:`uart_config_t::source_clk`\\n      - Select the clock source.\\n    * - ``uart_enable_pattern_det_intr()``\\n      - :cpp:func:`uart_enable_pattern_det_baud_intr`\\n      - Enable pattern detection interrupt.\\n\\nI2C\\n---\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :width: 700 px\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Removed/Deprecated items\\n      - Replacement\\n      - Remarks\\n    * - ``i2c_isr_register()``\\n      - None\\n      - I2C interrupt handling is implemented by driver itself.\\n    * - ``i2c_isr_register()``\\n      - None\\n      - I2C interrupt handling is implemented by driver itself.\\n    * - ``i2c_opmode_t``\\n      - None\\n      - It is not used anywhere in ESP-IDF.\\n\\nSPI\\n---\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :width: 700 px\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Removed/Deprecated items\\n      - Replacement\\n      - Remarks\\n    * - ``spi_cal_clock()``\\n      - :cpp:func:`spi_get_actual_clock`\\n      - Get SPI real working frequency.\\n\\n- The internal header file ``spi_common_internal.h`` has been moved to ``esp_private/spi_common_internal.h``.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SDMMC_HOST_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    SDMMC\\n    -----\\n\\n    .. list-table::\\n        :width: 700 px\\n        :header-rows: 1\\n\\n        * - Removed/Deprecated items\\n          - Replacement\\n          - Remarks\\n        * - ``sdmmc_host_pullup_en()``\\n          - set ``SDMMC_SLOT_FLAG_INTERNAL_PULLUP`` flag in :cpp:member:`sdmmc_slot_config_t::flags`\\n          - Enable internal pull up.\\n\\nLEDC\\n-----\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :width: 700 px\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Removed/Deprecated items\\n      - Replacement\\n      - Remarks\\n    * - ``bit_num`` in :cpp:type:`ledc_timer_config_t`\\n      - :cpp:member:`ledc_timer_config_t::duty_resolution`\\n      - Set resolution of the duty cycle.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_PCNT_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Pulse Counter Driver\\n    --------------------\\n\\n    Pulse counter driver has been redesigned (see :doc:`PCNT <../../../api-reference/peripherals/pcnt>`), which aims to unify and simplify the usage of PCNT peripheral.\\n\\n    Although it is recommended to use the new driver APIs, the legacy driver is still available in the previous include path ``driver/pcnt.h``.

In the new driver, PCNT unit is represented by :cpp:type:`pcnt_unit_handle_t`, likewise, PCNT channel is represented by :cpp:type:`pcnt_channel_handle_t`. Both of them are opaque pointers.\\n    - ``pcnt_evt_type_t`` is not used any more, they have been replaced by a universal **Watch Point Event**. In the event callback :cpp:type:`pcnt_watch_cb_t`, it is still possible to distinguish different watch points from :cpp:type:`pcnt_watch_event_data_t`.\\n    - ``pcnt_count_mode_t`` is replaced by :cpp:type:`pcnt_channel_edge_action_t`, and ``pcnt_ctrl_mode_t`` is replaced by :cpp:type:`pcnt_channel_level_action_t`.\\n\\n    Breaking Changes in Usage\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    - Previously, the PCNT unit configuration and channel configuration were combined into a single function: ``pcnt_unit_config``. They are now split into the two factory APIs: :cpp:func:`pcnt_new_unit` and :cpp:func:`pcnt_new_channel` respectively.\\n\\n        - Only the count range is necessary for initializing a PCNT unit. GPIO number assignment has been moved to :cpp:func:`pcnt_new_channel`.\\n        - High/Low control mode and positive/negative edge count mode are set by stand-alone functions: :cpp:func:`pcnt_channel_set_edge_action` and :cpp:func:`pcnt_channel_set_level_action`.\\n\\n    - ``pcnt_get_counter_value`` is replaced by :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_get_count`.\\n    - ``pcnt_counter_pause`` is replaced by :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_stop`.\\n    - ``pcnt_counter_resume`` is replaced by :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_start`.\\n    - ``pcnt_counter_clear`` is replaced by :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_clear_count`.\\n    - ``pcnt_intr_enable`` and ``pcnt_intr_disable`` are removed. In the new driver, the interrupt is enabled by registering event callbacks :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_register_event_callbacks`.\\n    - ``pcnt_event_enable`` and ``pcnt_event_disable`` are removed. In the new driver, the PCNT events are enabled/disabled by adding/removing watch points :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_add_watch_point`, :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_remove_watch_point`.\\n    - ``pcnt_set_event_value`` is removed. In the new driver, event value is also set when adding watch point by :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_add_watch_point`.\\n    - ``pcnt_get_event_value`` and ``pcnt_get_event_status`` are removed. In the new driver, these information are provided by event callback :cpp:type:`pcnt_watch_cb_t` in the :cpp:type:`pcnt_watch_event_data_t`.\\n    - ``pcnt_isr_register`` and ``pcnt_isr_unregister`` are removed. Register of the ISR handler from user\\'s code is no longer permitted. Users should register event callbacks instead by calling :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_register_event_callbacks`.\\n    - ``pcnt_set_pin`` is removed and the new driver no longer allows the switching of the GPIO at runtime. If users want to change to other GPIOs, please delete the existing PCNT channel by :cpp:func:`pcnt_del_channel` and reinstall with the new GPIO number by :cpp:func:`pcnt_new_channel`.\\n    - ``pcnt_filter_enable``, ``pcnt_filter_disable`` and ``pcnt_set_filter_value`` are replaced by :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_set_glitch_filter`. Meanwhile, ``pcnt_get_filter_value`` has been removed.\\n    - ``pcnt_set_mode`` is replaced by :cpp:func:`pcnt_channel_set_edge_action` and :cpp:func:`pcnt_channel_set_level_action`.\\n    - ``pcnt_isr_service_install``, ``pcnt_isr_service_uninstall``, ``pcnt_isr_handler_add`` and ``pcnt_isr_handler_remove`` are replaced by :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_register_event_callbacks`.

In the new driver, user needs to provide an encoder to \"translate\" the user data into RMT symbols.\\n    - ``rmt_get_counter_clock`` is removed, as the channel clock resolution is configured by user from :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::resolution_hz`.\\n    - ``rmt_wait_tx_done`` is replaced by :cpp:func:`rmt_tx_wait_all_done`.\\n    - ``rmt_translator_init``, ``rmt_translator_set_context`` and ``rmt_translator_get_context`` are removed. In the new driver, the translator has been replaced by the RMT encoder.\\n    - ``rmt_get_ringbuf_handle`` is removed. The new driver does not use Ringbuffer to save RMT symbols. Instead, the incoming data are saved to the user provided buffer directly. The user buffer can even be mounted to DMA link internally.\\n    - ``rmt_register_tx_end_callback`` is replaced by :cpp:func:`rmt_tx_register_event_callbacks`, where user can register :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_event_callbacks_t::on_trans_done` event callback.\\n    - ``rmt_set_intr_enable_mask`` and ``rmt_clr_intr_enable_mask`` are removed, as the interrupt is handled by the driver, user does not need to take care of it.\\n    - ``rmt_add_channel_to_group`` and ``rmt_remove_channel_from_group`` are replaced by RMT sync manager. Please refer to :cpp:func:`rmt_new_sync_manager`.\\n    - ``rmt_set_tx_loop_count`` is removed. The loop count in the new driver is configured in :cpp:member:`rmt_transmit_config_t::loop_count`.\\n    - ``rmt_enable_tx_loop_autostop`` is removed. In the new driver, TX loop auto stop is always enabled if available, it is not configurable anymore.\\n\\nLCD\\n---\\n\\n- The LCD panel initialization flow is slightly changed. Now the :cpp:func:`esp_lcd_panel_init` will not turn on the display automatically. User needs to call :cpp:func:`esp_lcd_panel_disp_on_off` to manually turn on the display. Note, this is different from turning on backlight. With this breaking change, user can flash a predefined pattern to the screen before turning on the screen. This can help avoid random noise on the screen after a power on reset.\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_lcd_panel_disp_off` is deprecated, please use :cpp:func:`esp_lcd_panel_disp_on_off` instead.\\n- ``dc_as_cmd_phase`` is removed. The SPI LCD driver currently does not support a 9-bit SPI LCD. Please always use a dedicated GPIO to control the LCD D/C line.\\n- The way to register RGB panel event callbacks has been moved from the :cpp:type:`esp_lcd_rgb_panel_config_t` into a separate API :cpp:func:`esp_lcd_rgb_panel_register_event_callbacks`. However, the event callback signature is not changed.\\n- Previous ``relax_on_idle`` flag in :cpp:type:`esp_lcd_rgb_panel_config_t` has been renamed into :cpp:member:`esp_lcd_rgb_panel_config_t::refresh_on_demand`, which expresses the same meaning but with a clear name.\\n- If the RGB LCD is created with the ``refresh_on_demand`` flag enabled, the driver will not start a refresh in the :cpp:func:`esp_lcd_panel_draw_bitmap`. Now users have to call :cpp:func:`esp_lcd_rgb_panel_refresh` to refresh the screen by themselves.\\n- :cpp:type:`esp_lcd_color_space_t` is deprecated, please use :cpp:type:`lcd_color_space_t` to describe the color space, and use :cpp:type:`lcd_rgb_element_order_t` to describe the data order of RGB color.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_MCPWM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    MCPWM\\n    -----\\n\\n    MCPWM driver was redesigned (see :doc:`MCPWM <../../../api-reference/peripherals/mcpwm>`), meanwhile, the legacy driver is deprecated.\\n\\n    The new driver\\'s aim is to make each MCPWM submodule independent to each other, and give the freedom of resource connection back to users.\\n\\n    Although it is recommended to use the new driver APIs, the legacy driver is still available in the previous include path ``driver/mcpwm.h``. However, using legacy driver triggers the build warning below by default. This warning can be suppressed by the Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_MCPWM_SUPPRESS_DEPRECATE_WARN`.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: text\\n\\n        legacy MCPWM driver is deprecated, please migrate to the new driver (include driver/mcpwm_prelude.h)\\n\\n    The major breaking changes in concept and usage are listed as follows:\\n\\n    Breaking Changes in Concepts\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The new MCPWM driver is object-oriented, where most of the MCPWM submodule has a driver object associated with it. The driver object is created by factory function like :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_timer`. IO control function always needs an object handle, in the first place.\\n\\n    The legacy driver has an inappropriate assumption, that is the MCPWM operator should be connected to different MCPWM timer. In fact, the hardware does not have such limitation. In the new driver, a MCPWM timer can be connected to multiple operators, so that the operators can achieve the best synchronization performance.\\n\\n    The legacy driver presets the way to generate a PWM waveform into a so called ``mcpwm_duty_type_t``. However, the duty cycle modes listed there are far from sufficient. Likewise, legacy driver has several preset ``mcpwm_deadtime_type_t``, which also does not cover all the use cases. What is more, user usually gets confused by the name of the duty cycle mode and dead-time mode. In the new driver, there are no such limitation, but user has to construct the generator behavior from scratch.\\n\\n    In the legacy driver, the ways to synchronize the MCPWM timer by GPIO, software and other timer module are not unified. It increased learning costs for users. In the new driver, the synchronization APIs are unified.\\n\\n    The legacy driver has mixed the concepts of \"Fault detector\" and \"Fault handler\". Which make the APIs very confusing to users. In the new driver, the fault object just represents a failure source, and we introduced a new concept -- **brake** to express the concept of \"Fault handler\". What is more, the new driver supports software fault.\\n\\n    The legacy drive only provides callback functions for the capture submodule. The new driver provides more useful callbacks for various MCPWM submodules, like timer stop, compare match, fault enter, brake, etc.\\n\\n    - ``mcpwm_io_signals_t`` and ``mcpwm_pin_config_t`` are not used. GPIO configuration has been moved into submodule\\'s configuration structure.\\n    - ``mcpwm_timer_t``, ``mcpwm_generator_t`` are not used. Timer and generator are represented by :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_handle_t` and :cpp:type:`mcpwm_gen_handle_t`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_fault_signal_t`` and ``mcpwm_sync_signal_t`` are not used. Fault and sync source are represented by :cpp:type:`mcpwm_fault_handle_t` and :cpp:type:`mcpwm_sync_handle_t`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_capture_signal_t`` is not used. A capture channel is represented by :cpp:type:`mcpwm_cap_channel_handle_t`.\\n\\n    Breaking Changes in Usage\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    - ``mcpwm_gpio_init`` and ``mcpwm_set_pin``: GPIO configurations are moved to submodule\\'s own configuration. e.g., set the PWM GPIO in :cpp:member:`mcpwm_generator_config_t::gen_gpio_num`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_init``: To get an expected PWM waveform, users need to allocated at least one MCPWM timer and MCPWM operator, then connect them by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_connect_timer`. After that, users should set the generator\\'s actions on various events by calling e.g., :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_timer_event`, :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_compare_event`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_group_set_resolution``: in the new driver, the group resolution is fixed to the maximum, usually it is 80 MHz.\\n    - ``mcpwm_timer_set_resolution``: MCPWM Timer resolution is set in :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::resolution_hz`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_set_frequency``: PWM frequency is determined by :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::resolution_hz`, :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::count_mode` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::period_ticks`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_set_duty``: To set the PWM duty cycle, users should call :cpp:func:`mcpwm_comparator_set_compare_value` to change comparator\\'s threshold.\\n    - ``mcpwm_set_duty_type``: There is no preset duty cycle types. The duty cycle type is configured by setting different generator actions. e.g., :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_timer_event`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_set_signal_high`` and ``mcpwm_set_signal_low`` are replaced by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_force_level`. In the new driver, it is implemented by setting force action for the generator, instead of changing the duty cycle to 0% or 100% at the background.\\n    - ``mcpwm_start`` and ``mcpwm_stop`` are replaced by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_start_stop`. You have more modes to start and stop the MCPWM timer, see :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_start_stop_cmd_t`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_carrier_init`` is replaced by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_apply_carrier`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_carrier_enable`` and ``mcpwm_carrier_disable``: Enabling and disabling carrier submodule is done automatically by checking whether the carrier configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t` is NULL.\\n    - ``mcpwm_carrier_set_period`` is replaced by :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::frequency_hz`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_carrier_set_duty_cycle`` is replaced by :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::duty_cycle`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_carrier_oneshot_mode_enable`` is replaced by :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::first_pulse_duration_us`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_carrier_oneshot_mode_disable`` is removed. Disabling the first pulse (a.k.a the one-shot pulse) in the carrier is never supported by the hardware.\\n    - ``mcpwm_carrier_output_invert`` is replaced by :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::invert_before_modulate` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::invert_after_modulate`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_deadtime_enable`` and ``mcpwm_deadtime_disable`` are replaced by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_dead_time`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_fault_init`` is replaced by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_gpio_fault`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_fault_set_oneshot_mode``, ``mcpwm_fault_set_cyc_mode`` are replaced by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_set_brake_on_fault` and :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_brake_event`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_capture_enable`` is removed. It is duplicated to :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_enable_channel`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_capture_disable`` is removed. It is duplicated to :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_capture_disable_channel`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_capture_enable_channel`` and ``mcpwm_capture_disable_channel`` are replaced by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_enable` and :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_disable`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_capture_signal_get_value`` and ``mcpwm_capture_signal_get_edge``: Capture timer count value and capture edge are provided in the capture event callback, via :cpp:type:`mcpwm_capture_event_data_t`. Capture data are only valuable when capture event happens. Providing single API to fetch capture data is meaningless.\\n    - ``mcpwm_sync_enable`` is removed. It is duplicated to :cpp:func:`mcpwm_sync_configure`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_sync_configure`` is replaced by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_set_phase_on_sync`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_sync_disable`` is equivalent to setting :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_sync_phase_config_t::sync_src` to ``NULL``.\\n    - ``mcpwm_set_timer_sync_output`` is replaced by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_timer_sync_src`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_timer_trigger_soft_sync`` is replaced by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_soft_sync_activate`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_sync_invert_gpio_synchro`` is equivalent to setting :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gpio_sync_src_config_t::active_neg`.\\n    - ``mcpwm_isr_register`` is removed. You can register various event callbacks instead. For example, to register capture event callback, users can use :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_register_event_callbacks`.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_DEDICATED_GPIO_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Dedicated GPIO Driver\\n    ---------------------\\n\\n    - All of the dedicated GPIO related Low Level (LL) functions in ``cpu_ll.h`` have been moved to ``dedic_gpio_cpu_ll.h`` and renamed.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_I2S_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    I2S Driver\\n    ----------\\n\\n    The I2S driver has been redesigned (see :doc:`I2S Driver <../../../api-reference/peripherals/i2s>`), which aims to rectify the shortcomings of the driver that were exposed when supporting all the new features of ESP32-C3 & ESP32-S3. The new driver\\'s APIs are available by including corresponding I2S mode\\'s header files :component_file:`esp_driver_i2s/include/driver/i2s_std.h`, :component_file:`esp_driver_i2s/include/driver/i2s_pdm.h`, or :component_file:`esp_driver_i2s/include/driver/i2s_tdm.h`.\\n\\n    Meanwhile, the old driver\\'s APIs in :component_file:`driver/deprecated/driver/i2s.h` are still supported for backward compatibility. But there will be warnings if users keep using the old APIs in their projects, these warnings can be suppressed by the Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_I2S_SUPPRESS_DEPRECATE_WARN`.\\n\\n    Here is the general overview of the current I2S files:\\n\\n    .. figure:: ../../../../_static/diagrams/i2s/i2s_file_structure.png\\n        :align: center\\n        :alt: I2S File Structure\\n\\n    Breaking changes in Concepts\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Independent TX/RX channels\\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\n    The minimum control unit in new I2S driver are now individual TX/RX channels instead of an entire I2S controller (that consistes of multiple channels).\\n\\n    - The TX and RX channels of the same I2S controller can be controlled separately, meaning that they are configured such that they can be started or stopped separately.\\n    - The :cpp:type:`i2s_chan_handle_t` handle type is used to uniquely identify I2S channels. All the APIs require the channel handle and users need to maintain the channel handles by themselves.\\n    - On the ESP32-C3 and ESP32-S3, TX and RX channels in the same controller can be configured to different clocks or modes.\\n    - However, on the ESP32 and ESP32-S2, the TX and RX channels of the same controller still share some hardware resources. Thus, configurations may cause one channel to affect another channel in the same controller.\\n    - The channels can be registered to an available I2S controller automatically by setting :cpp:enumerator:`i2s_port_t::I2S_NUM_AUTO` as I2S port ID which causes the driver to search for the available TX/RX channels. However, the driver also supports registering channels to a specific port.\\n    - In order to distinguish between TX/RX channels and sound channels, the term \"channel\" in the context of the I2S driver only refers to TX/RX channels. Meanwhile, sound channels are referred to as \"slots\".\\n\\n    I2S Mode Categorization\\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\n    I2S communication modes are categorized into the following three modes. Note that:\\n\\n    - **Standard mode**: Standard mode always has two slots, it can support Philips, MSB, and PCM (short frame sync) formats. Please refer to :component_file:`esp_driver_i2s/include/driver/i2s_std.h` for more details.\\n    - **PDM mode**: PDM mode only supports two slots with 16-bit data width, but the configurations of PDM TX and PDM RX are slightly different. For PDM TX, the sample rate can be set by :cpp:member:`i2s_pdm_tx_clk_config_t::sample_rate`, and its clock frequency depends on the up-sampling configuration. For PDM RX, the sample rate can be set by :cpp:member:`i2s_pdm_rx_clk_config_t::sample_rate`, and its clock frequency depends on the down-sampling configuration. Please refer to :component_file:`esp_driver_i2s/include/driver/i2s_pdm.h` for details.\\n    - **TDM mode**: TDM mode can support up to 16 slots. It can work in Philips, MSB, PCM (short frame sync), and PCM (long frame sync) formats. Please refer to :component_file:`esp_driver_i2s/include/driver/i2s_tdm.h` for details.\\n\\n    When allocating a new channel in a specific mode, users should initialize that channel by its corresponding function. It is strongly recommended to use the helper macros to generate the default configurations in case the default values are changed in the future.\\n\\n    Independent Slot and Clock Configuration\\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\n    The slot configurations and clock configurations can be configured separately.\\n\\n    - Call :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_init_std_mode`, :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_init_pdm_rx_mode`, :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_init_pdm_tx_mode`, or :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_init_tdm_mode` to initialize the slot/clock/gpio_pin configurations.\\n    - Calling :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_reconfig_std_slot`, :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_reconfig_pdm_rx_slot`, :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_reconfig_pdm_tx_slot`, or :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_reconfig_tdm_slot` can change the slot configurations after initialization.\\n    - Calling :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_reconfig_std_clock`, :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_reconfig_pdm_rx_clock`, :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_reconfig_pdm_tx_clock`, or :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_reconfig_tdm_clock` can change the clock configurations after initialization.\\n    - Calling :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_reconfig_std_gpio`, :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_reconfig_pdm_rx_gpio`, :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_reconfig_pdm_tx_gpio`, or :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_reconfig_tdm_gpio` can change the GPIO configurations after initialization.\\n\\n    Misc\\n    \"\"\"\"\\n\\n    - States and state-machine are adopted in the new I2S driver to avoid APIs called in wrong state.\\n    - ADC and DAC modes are removed. They are only supported in their own drivers and the legacy I2S driver.\\n\\n    Breaking Changes in Usage\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    To use the new I2S driver, please follow these steps:\\n\\n    1. Call :cpp:func:`i2s_new_channel` to acquire channel handles. We should specify the work role and I2S port in this step. Besides, the TX or RX channel handle will be generated by the driver. Inputting both two TX and RX channel handles is not necessary but at least one handle is needed. In the case of inputting both two handles, the driver will work at the duplex mode. Both TX and RX channels will be avaliable on a same port, and they will share the MCLK, BCLK and WS signal. But if only one of the TX or RX channel handle is inputted, this channel will only work in the simplex mode.\\n    2. Call :func:`i2s_channel_init_std_mode`, :func:`i2s_channel_init_pdm_rx_mode`, :func:`i2s_channel_init_pdm_tx_mode` or :func:`i2s_channel_init_tdm_mode` to initialize the channel to the specified mode. Corresponding slot, clock and GPIO configurations are needed in this step.\\n    3. (Optional) Call :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_register_event_callback` to register the ISR event callback functions. I2S events now can be received by the callback function synchronously, instead of from the event queue asynchronously.\\n    4. Call :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_enable` to start the hardware of I2S channel. In the new driver, I2S does not start automatically after installed, and users are supposed to know clearly whether the channel has started or not.\\n    5. Read or write data by :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_read` or :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_write`. Certainly, only the RX channel handle is suppoesd to be inputted in :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_read` and the TX channel handle in :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_write`.\\n    6. (Optional) The slot, clock and GPIO configurations can be changed by corresponding \\'reconfig\\' functions, but :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_disable` must be called before updating the configurations.\\n    7. Call :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_disable` to stop the hardware of I2S channel.\\n    8. Call :cpp:func:`i2s_del_channel` to delete and release the resources of the channel if it is not needed any more, but the channel must be disabled before deleting it.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_TWAI_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    TWAI Driver\\n    -----------\\n\\n    The deprecated ``CAN`` peripheral driver is removed. Please use ``TWAI`` driver instead (i.e., include ``driver/twai.h`` in your application).\\n\\nRegister Access Macros\\n----------------------\\n\\nPreviously, all register access macros could be used as expressions, so the following was allowed::\\n\\n    uint32_t val = REG_SET_BITS(reg, bits, mask);\\n\\nIn ESP-IDF v5.0, register access macros which write or read-modify-write the register can no longer be used as expressions, and can only be used as statements. This applies to the following macros: ``REG_WRITE``, ``REG_SET_BIT``, ``REG_CLR_BIT``, ``REG_SET_BITS``, ``REG_SET_FIELD``, ``WRITE_PERI_REG``, ``CLEAR_PERI_REG_MASK``, ``SET_PERI_REG_MASK``, ``SET_PERI_REG_BITS``.\\n\\nTo store the value which would have been written into the register, split the operation as follows::\\n\\n    uint32_t new_val = REG_READ(reg) | mask;\\n    REG_WRITE(reg, new_val);\\n\\nTo get the value of the register after modification (which may be different from the value written), add an explicit read::\\n\\n    REG_SET_BITS(reg, bits, mask);\\n    uint32_t new_val = REG_READ(reg);\\n',\n",

Although it is recommended to use the new driver APIs, the legacy driver is still available in the previous include path ``driver/i2c.h``.\\n\\n    The major breaking changes in concept and usage are listed as follows:\\n\\n    Major Changes in Concepts\\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n    - ``i2c_config_t`` which was used to configure the I2C bus, but it doesn't really tell whether to configure master or slave. So in the new design, master and slave initialization are separate, user can call ``i2c_master_bus_config_t`` or ``i2c_slave_config_t``.\\n    - ``i2c_mode_t`` which was used to tell whether I2C controller works in slave mode or master mode. This enumerator has been deprecated. In the new driver, users don'tneed to manually set the mode anymore since master and slave APIs are different.\\n    - ``i2c_rw_t`` which was used to tell whether I2C master controller is performing a `write` or a `read` operation. This is now deprecated.\\n    - ``i2c_addr_mode_t`` was renamed to ``i2c_addr_bit_len_t``.\\n    -  In the legacy driver, operations needed to be chained with a command list (dynamically or statically created). The new driver now handles this internally, making the operations more size and space efficient.\\n    -  Capability flags like ``I2C_SCLK_SRC_FLAG_FOR_NOMAL`` are used to select clock source in the legacy driver. In the new driver, users can select clock source directly.\\n\\n    Major Changes in Usage\\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n    -  I2C bus initialization is done in two parts: first, initialization of the bus with :cpp:func:`i2c_new_master_bus`, then, initialization of the I2C device with :cpp:func:`i2c_master_bus_add_device`.\\n    -  ``i2c_reset_tx_fifo`` and ``i2c_reset_rx_fifo`` have been removed, since it is never required to reset the fifo by users. Whole bus can still be reset by calling ``i2c_master_bus_reset``.\\n    -  ``i2c_cmd_link_xxx`` functions have been removed, user doesn't need to use link to link commands on its own.\\n    -  ``i2c_master_write_to_device`` has been renamed to ``i2c_master_transmit``.\\n    -  ``i2c_master_read_from_device`` has been renamed to ``i2c_master_receive``.\\n    -  ``i2c_master_write_read_device`` has been renamed to ``i2c_master_transmit_receive``\\n    -  ``i2c_slave_write_buffer`` has been renamed to ``i2c_slave_transmit``\\n    -  ``i2c_slave_read_buffer`` has been renamed to ``i2c_slave_receive``\\n\",\n",

If the partition does not have aligned size, partition table generator tool will raise an error. This fix ensures that OTA updates for a case where the file size is close or equal to the size of partition works correctly (erase operation does not go beyond the partition size).\\n\\nIn case you have the ``app`` partition size which is not a multiple of the 4 KB then please note that while migrating to ESP-IDF 5.3, you must align this size to its lower 4 KB boundary for the build to succeed.

Power failures during the secure manufacturing process could cause issues that are hard to debug and, in some cases, may cause permanent boot-up failures.\\n\\nThis guide highlights an approach where security features are enabled with the assistance of an external host machine. Security workflows are broken down into various stages and key material is generated on the host machine; thus, allowing greater recovery chances in case of power or other failures. It also offers better timings for secure manufacturing, e.g., in the case of encryption of firmware on the host machine vs. on the device.\\n\\n\\nGoals\\n-----\\n\\n#. Simplify the traditional workflow with stepwise instructions.\\n#. Design a more flexible workflow as compared to the traditional firmware-based workflow.\\n#. Improve reliability by dividing the workflow into small operations.\\n#.

Enable the Flash Encryption feature by following the steps listed in :ref:`enable-flash-encryption-externally`.\\n#. Enable the Secure Boot V2 feature by following the steps listed in :ref:`enable-secure-boot-v2-externally`.\\n\\nThe reason for this order is as follows:\\n\\nTo enable the Secure Boot (SB) V2, it is necessary to keep the SB V2 key readable. To protect the key\\'s readability, the write protection for ``RD_DIS`` (``ESP_EFUSE_WR_DIS_RD_DIS``) is applied. However, this action poses a challenge when attempting to enable Flash Encryption, as the Flash Encryption (FE) key needs to remain unreadable. This conflict arises because the ``RD_DIS`` is already write-protected, making it impossible to read protect the FE key.\\n\\n.. _enable-flash-encryption-externally:\\n\\nEnable Flash Encryption Externally\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn this case, all the eFuses related to flash encryption are written with help of the espefuse tool.

It is recommended that they should be burned in production use cases as explained in step 6.\\n\\n5. Encrypt and flash the binaries.\\n\\n  The bootloader and the application binaries for the project must be built with Flash Encryption Release mode with default configurations.\\n\\n  Flash encryption Release mode can be set in the menuconfig as follows:\\n\\n  .. list::\\n\\n      - :ref:`Enable flash encryption on boot <CONFIG_SECURE_FLASH_ENC_ENABLED>`\\n      :esp32: - :ref:`Select Release mode <CONFIG_SECURE_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_MODE>` (Note that once Release mode is selected, the ``DISABLE_DL_ENCRYPT`` and ``DISABLE_DL_DECRYPT`` eFuse bits will be burned to disable flash encryption hardware in ROM Download Mode.)\\n      :esp32: - :ref:`Select UART ROM download mode (Permanently disabled (recommended)) <CONFIG_SECURE_UART_ROM_DL_MODE>` (Note that this option is only available when :ref:`CONFIG_ESP32_REV_MIN` is set to 3 (ESP32 V3).) The default choice is to keep UART ROM download mode enabled, however it is recommended to permanently disable this mode to reduce the options available to an attacker.\\n      :not esp32: - :ref:`Select Release mode <CONFIG_SECURE_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_MODE>` (Note that once Release mode is selected, the ``EFUSE_DIS_DOWNLOAD_MANUAL_ENCRYPT`` eFuse bit will be burned to disable flash encryption hardware in ROM Download Mode.)\\n      :not esp32: - :ref:`Select UART ROM download mode (Permanently switch to Secure mode (recommended)) <CONFIG_SECURE_UART_ROM_DL_MODE>`. This is the default option and is recommended. It is also possible to change this configuration setting to permanently disable UART ROM download mode, if this mode is not needed.\\n      - :ref:`Select the appropriate bootloader log verbosity <CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_LOG_LEVEL>`\\n      - Save the configuration and exit.\\n\\n\\n  The binaries can be encrypted on the host machine by running:\\n\\n  .. only:: esp32\\n\\n      .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n         espsecure.py encrypt_flash_data --keyfile my_flash_encryption_key.bin --address 0x1000 --output bootloader-enc.bin build/bootloader/bootloader.bin\\n\\n         espsecure.py encrypt_flash_data --keyfile my_flash_encryption_key.bin --address 0x8000 --output partition-table-enc.bin build/partition_table/partition-table.bin\\n\\n         espsecure.py encrypt_flash_data --keyfile my_flash_encryption_key.bin --address 0x10000 --output my-app-enc.bin build/my-app.bin\\n\\n  .. only:: not esp32\\n\\n      .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n         espsecure.py encrypt_flash_data --aes_xts --keyfile my_flash_encryption_key.bin --address 0x0 --output bootloader-enc.bin build/my-app.bin\\n\\n         espsecure.py encrypt_flash_data --aes_xts --keyfile my_flash_encryption_key.bin --address 0x8000 --output partition-table-enc.bin build/partition_table/partition-table.bin\\n\\n         espsecure.py encrypt_flash_data --aes_xts --keyfile my_flash_encryption_key.bin --address 0x10000 --output my-app-enc.bin build/my-app.bin\\n\\n  The above files can then be flashed to their respective offset using ``esptool.py``. To see all of the command line options recommended for ``esptool.py``, see the output printed when ``idf.py build`` succeeds. In the above command the offsets are used for a sample firmware, the actual offset for your firmware can be obtained by checking the partition table entry or by running `idf.py partition-table`. When the application contains the following partition: ``otadata``, ``nvs_encryption_keys`` they need to be encrypted as well. Please refer to :ref:`encrypted-partitions` for more details about encrypted partitions.\\n\\n  .. note::\\n\\n     If the flashed ciphertext file is not recognized by the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} when it boots, check that the keys match and that the command line arguments match exactly, including the correct offset. It is important to provide the correct offset as the ciphertext changes when the offset changes.\\n\\n     .. only:: esp32\\n\\n         If your ESP32 uses non-default :ref:`FLASH_CRYPT_CONFIG value in eFuse <setting-flash-crypt-config>` then you will need to pass the ``--flash_crypt_conf`` argument to ``espsecure.py`` to set the matching value. This will not happen if the device configured flash encryption by itself but may happen when burning eFuses manually to enable flash encryption.\\n\\n  The command ``espsecure.py decrypt_flash_data`` can be used with the same options (and different input/output files), to decrypt ciphertext flash contents or a previously encrypted file.\\n\\n6.

Delete flash encryption key on host:\\n\\n        Once the flash encryption has been enabled for the device, the key **must be deleted immediately**. This ensures that the host cannot produce encrypted binaries for the same device going forward. This step is important to reduce the vulnerability of the flash encryption key.\\n\\nFlash Encryption Guidelines\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n* It is recommended to generate a unique flash encryption key for each device for production use-cases.\\n* It is recommended to ensure that the RNG used by host machine to generate the flash encryption key has good entropy.\\n* See :ref:`flash-encryption-limitations` for more details.\\n\\n.. _enable-secure-boot-v2-externally:\\n\\nEnable Secure Boot V2 Externally\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn this workflow, we shall use ``espsecure`` tool to generate signing keys and use the ``espefuse`` tool to burn the relevant eFuses. The details about the Secure Boot V2 process can be found at :doc:`Secure Boot V2 Guide </security/secure-boot-v2>`\\n\\n1. Generate Secure Boot V2 Signing Private Key.\\n\\n  .. only:: esp32 or SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_RSA\\n\\n     The Secure Boot V2 signing key for the RSA3072 scheme can be generated by running:\\n\\n     .. code:: bash\\n\\n         espsecure.py generate_signing_key --version 2 --scheme rsa3072 secure_boot_signing_key.pem\\n\\n  .. only:: SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_ECC\\n\\n     The Secure Boot V2 signing key for ECDSA scheme can be generated by running:\\n\\n      .. code:: bash\\n\\n          espsecure.py generate_signing_key --version 2 --scheme ecdsa256 secure_boot_signing_key.pem\\n\\n     The scheme in the above command can be changed to ``ecdsa192`` to generate ecdsa192 private key.\\n\\n  .. only:: SOC_EFUSE_REVOKE_BOOT_KEY_DIGESTS\\n\\n     A total of 3 keys can be used for Secure Boot V2 at once. These should be computed independently and stored separately. The same command with different key file names can be used to generate multiple Secure Boot V2 signing keys. It is recommended to use multiple keys in order to reduce dependency on a single key.\\n\\n2. Generate Public Key Digest.\\n\\n  The public key digest for the private key generated in the previous step can be generated by running:\\n\\n  .. code:: bash\\n\\n      espsecure.py digest_sbv2_public_key --keyfile secure_boot_signing_key.pem --output digest.bin\\n\\n  .. only:: SOC_EFUSE_REVOKE_BOOT_KEY_DIGESTS\\n\\n      In case of multiple digests, each digest should be kept in a separate file.\\n\\n3. Burn the key digest in eFuse.\\n\\n  The public key digest can be burned in the eFuse by running:\\n\\n  .. only:: esp32\\n\\n      .. code:: bash\\n\\n          espefuse.py --port PORT --chip esp32 burn_key secure_boot_v2 digest.bin\\n\\n  .. only:: esp32c2\\n\\n     .. code:: bash\\n\\n          espefuse.py --port PORT --chip esp32c2 burn_key KEY_BLOCK0 SECURE_BOOT_DIGEST digest.bin\\n\\n  .. only:: SOC_EFUSE_REVOKE_BOOT_KEY_DIGESTS\\n\\n      .. code:: bash\\n\\n          espefuse.py --port PORT --chip {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME} burn_key BLOCK SECURE_BOOT_DIGEST0 digest.bin\\n\\n      where ``BLOCK`` is a free keyblock between ``BLOCK_KEY0`` and ``BLOCK_KEY5``.\\n\\n      In case of multiple digests, the other digests can be burned sequentially by changing the key purpose to ``SECURE_BOOT_DIGEST1`` and ``SECURE_BOOT_DIGEST2`` respectively.\\n\\n4. Enable Secure Boot V2.\\n\\n  Secure Boot V2 eFuse can be enabled by running:\\n\\n  .. only:: esp32\\n\\n     .. code:: bash\\n\\n          espefuse.py --port PORT --chip esp32 burn_efuse ABS_DONE_1\\n\\n  .. only:: not esp32\\n\\n     .. code:: bash\\n\\n          espefuse.py --port PORT --chip {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME} burn_efuse SECURE_BOOT_EN\\n\\n\\n  .. note::\\n\\n     At this stage the secure boot V2 has been enabled for the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. The ROM bootloader shall now verify the authenticity of the :ref:`second-stage-bootloader` on every bootup. You may test the secure boot process by executing Steps 5 & 6. Please note that security-related eFuses have not been burned at this point. For production use cases, all security-related eFuses must be burned as given in step 7.\\n\\n5. Build the binaries.\\n\\n  By default, the ROM bootloader would only verify the :ref:`second-stage-bootloader` (firmware bootloader). The firmware bootloader would verify the app partition only when the :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT` option is enabled (and :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT_VERSION` is set to ``SECURE_BOOT_V2_ENABLED``) while building the bootloader.\\n\\n  a) Open the :ref:`project-configuration-menu`, in \"Security features\" set \"Enable hardware Secure Boot in bootloader\" to enable Secure Boot.\\n\\n  .. only:: esp32\\n\\n      For ESP32, Secure Boot V2 is available only for ESP32 ECO3 onwards. To view the \"Secure Boot V2\" option the chip revision should be changed to revision v3.0 (ECO3). To change the chip revision, set \"Minimum Supported ESP32 Revision\" to \"Rev 3.0 (ECO3)\" in \"Component Config\" -> \"Hardware Settings\" -> \"Chip Revision\".\\n\\n  .. only:: SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_RSA or SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_ECC\\n\\n      The \"Secure Boot V2\" option will be selected and the \"App Signing Scheme\" will be set to {IDF_TARGET_SBV2_DEFAULT_SCHEME} by default.\\n\\n  b) Disable the option :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT_BUILD_SIGNED_BINARIES` for the project in the :ref:`project-configuration-menu`. This shall make sure that all the generated binaries are secure padded and unsigned. This step is done to avoid generating signed binaries as we are going to manually sign the binaries using ``espsecure`` tool.\\n\\n  After the above configurations, the bootloader and application binaries can be built with ``idf.py build`` command.\\n\\n6. Sign and Flash the binaries.\\n\\n  The Secure Boot V2 workflow only verifies the ``bootloader`` and ``application`` binaries, hence only those binaries need to be signed. The other binaries (e.g., ``partition-table.bin``) can be flashed as they are generated in the build stage.\\n\\n  The ``bootloader.bin`` and ``app.bin`` binaries can be signed by running:\\n\\n  .. code:: bash\\n\\n     espsecure.py sign_data --version 2 --keyfile secure_boot_signing_key.pem --output bootloader-signed.bin build/bootloader/bootloader.bin\\n\\n     espsecure.py sign_data --version 2 --keyfile secure_boot_signing_key.pem --output my-app-signed.bin build/my-app.bin\\n\\n  .. only:: SOC_EFUSE_REVOKE_BOOT_KEY_DIGESTS\\n\\n      If multiple keys secure boot keys are to be used then the same signed binary can be appended with a signature block signed with the new key as follows:\\n\\n      .. code:: bash\\n\\n          espsecure.py sign_data --keyfile secure_boot_signing_key2.pem --version 2 --append_signatures -o bootloader-signed2.bin bootloader-signed.bin\\n\\n          espsecure.py sign_data --keyfile secure_boot_signing_key2.pem --version 2 --append_signatures -o my-app-signed2.bin my-app-signed.bin\\n\\n      The same process can be repeated for the third key. Note that the names of the input and output files must not be the same.\\n\\n  The signatures attached to a binary can be checked by running:\\n\\n  .. code:: bash\\n\\n     espsecure.py signature_info_v2 bootloader-signed.bin\\n\\n  The above files along with other binaries (e.g., partition table) can then be flashed to their respective offset using ``esptool.py``. To see all of the command line options recommended for ``esptool.py``, see the output printed when ``idf.py build`` succeeds. The flash offset for your firmware can be obtained by checking the partition table entry or by running ``idf.py partition-table``.\\n\\n7.

       " 'Secure Boot\\n===========\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n    All references in this document are related to Secure Boot V1, i.e., the AES-based Secure Boot Scheme. For ESP32 v3.0 onwards, the preferred secure boot scheme is :doc:`secure-boot-v2`.\\n\\n    Please refer to :doc:`secure-boot-v2` for ESP32 v3.0 or ESP32-S2.\\n\\nSecure boot is a feature for ensuring only your code can run on the chip. Data loaded from flash is verified on each reset.\\n\\nSecure boot is separate from the :doc:`flash-encryption` feature, and you can use secure boot without encrypting the flash contents. However, for a secure environment, both should be used simultaneously. See :ref:`secure-boot-and-flash-encr` for more details.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n    Enabling secure boot limits your options for further updates of your {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. Make sure to read this document thoroughly and understand the implications of enabling secure boot.\\n\\n\\nBackground\\n----------\\n\\n- Most data is stored in flash. Flash access does not need to be protected from physical access for secure boot to function, because critical data is stored in eFuses internal to the chip and is non-software-accessible.\\n\\n- eFuses are used to store the secure boot information permanently. The secure boot key is stored in eFuse BLOCK2, and also, a single eFuse bit ABS_DONE_0 is burned, or written to 1, to permanently enable secure boot on the chip. For more details on eFuses, see *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* > *eFuse Controller (EFUSE)* [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#efuse>`__].\\n\\n- To understand the secure boot process, please familiarize yourself with the standard :doc:`../api-guides/startup`.\\n\\n- Both stages of the boot process, including initial software bootloader load and subsequent partition & app loading, are verified by the secure boot process, in a chain of trust relationship.\\n\\n\\nSecure Boot Process Overview\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThis is a high-level overview of the secure boot process. Step-by-step instructions are supplied under :ref:`secure-boot-how-to`. Further in-depth details are supplied under :ref:`secure-boot-technical-details`:\\n\\n1. The options to enable secure boot are provided in the :ref:`project-configuration-menu`, under ``Secure Boot Configuration``.\\n\\n2. Secure boot defaults to signing images and partition table data during the build process. The ``Secure boot private signing key`` config item is a file path to an ECDSA public/private key pair in a PEM format file.\\n\\n3. The software bootloader image is built by ESP-IDF with secure boot support enabled, and the public key for signature verification is integrated into the bootloader image. This software bootloader image is flashed at offset 0x1000.\\n\\n4. On the first boot, the software bootloader follows the following process to enable a secure boot:\\n\\n   - Hardware secure boot support generates a device-secure bootloader key and a secure digest. The secure bootloader key is generated with the help of the hardware RNG, and then stored in eFuse with read and write protection enabled. The digest is derived from the key, an initialization vector (IV), and the bootloader image contents.\\n   - The secure digest is flashed at offset 0x0 in the flash.\\n   - Depending on Secure Boot Configuration, eFuses are burned to disable JTAG and the ROM BASIC interpreter. It is **strongly recommended** that these options are turned on.\\n   - Bootloader permanently enables secure boot by burning the ABS_DONE_0 eFuse. The software bootloader then becomes protected. After this point, the chip will only boot a bootloader image if the digest matches.\\n\\n5. On subsequent boots, the ROM bootloader sees that the secure boot eFuse is burned, reads the saved digest at 0x0, and uses hardware secure boot support to compare it with a newly calculated digest. If the digest does not match then booting will not continue. The digest and comparison are performed entirely by hardware, and the calculated digest is not readable by software. For technical details see :ref:`secure-boot-hardware-support`.\\n\\n6. When running in secure boot mode, the software bootloader uses the secure boot signing key, the public key of which is embedded in the bootloader itself and therefore validated as part of the bootloader, to verify the signature appended to all subsequent partition tables and app images before they are booted.\\n\\n\\nKeys\\n----\\n\\nThe following keys are used by the secure boot process:\\n\\n- The secure bootloader key is a 256-bit AES key that is stored in eFuse block 2. The bootloader can generate this key itself from the internal hardware random number generator, and you do not need to supply it. It is optionally possible to supply this key, see :ref:`secure-boot-reflashable`. The eFuse holding this key is read and write protected before the secure boot is enabled to prevent further software access of the key.\\n\\n  - By default, the eFuse Block 2 Coding Scheme is ``None`` and a 256-bit key is stored in this block. On some versions of {IDF_TARGET_NAME}s, the Coding Scheme is set to ``3/4 Encoding`` with CODING_SCHEME eFuse has value 1, and a 192-bit key must be stored in this block.\\n\\n  .. only:: esp32\\n\\n    For more details, see *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* > *eFuse Controller (EFUSE)* > *System Parameter coding_scheme* [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#efuse>`__].\\n\\n  The algorithm operates on a 256-bit key in all cases. 192-bit keys are extended by repeating some bits, see :ref:`secure-bootloader-digest-algorithm`.\\n\\n- ``secure boot signing key`` is a standard ECDSA public/private key pair in PEM format, see :ref:`secure-boot-image-signing-algorithm`.\\n\\n  - The public key from this key pair is compiled into the software bootloader. It is only used for signature verification purposes and not signature creation. This public key is used to verify the second stage of booting, including the partition table and app image, before booting continues. The public key can be freely distributed; it does not need to be kept secret.\\n\\n  - The private key from this key pair **must be securely kept private**, as anyone who has this key can authenticate to any bootloader that is configured with a secure boot and the matching public key.\\n\\n\\nBootloader Size\\n---------------\\n\\nEnabling secure boot and/or flash encryption will increase the size of the bootloader, which might require updating the partition table offset. See :ref:`bootloader-size`.\\n\\n\\n.. _secure-boot-how-to:\\n\\nHow to Enable Secure Boot\\n-------------------------\\n\\n1. Open the :ref:`project-configuration-menu`, navigate to ``Secure Boot Configuration`` and select the option ``One-time Flash``. To understand the alternative ``Reflashable`` option, see :ref:`secure-boot-reflashable`.\\n\\n2. Select a name for the secure boot signing key. This option will appear after secure boot is enabled, and the key file can be anywhere on your system. If you opt for a relative path, it will be evaluated based on the project directory. Importantly, there\\'s no need for the file to exist when making this selection.\\n\\n3. Set other menuconfig options as desired. Pay particular attention to the ``Bootloader Config`` options, as you can only flash the bootloader once. Then exit menuconfig and save your configuration.\\n\\n4. When you run ``idf.py build`` for the first time, if the signing key is not found, then an error message will be printed with a command to generate a signing key via ``espsecure.py generate_signing_key``.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n   A signing key generated this way will use the best random number source available to the OS and its Python installation, i.e., `/dev/urandom` on OSX/Linux and `CryptGenRandom()` on Windows. If this random number source is weak, then the private key will be weak.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n   For production environments, we recommend generating the key pair using OpenSSL or another industry-standard encryption program. See :ref:`secure-boot-generate-key` for more details.\\n\\n5. Run ``idf.py bootloader`` to build a secure boot-enabled bootloader. The build output will include a prompt for a flashing command, using ``esptool.py write_flash``.\\n\\n.. _secure-boot-resume-normal-flashing:\\n\\n6. When you are ready to flash the bootloader, run the specified command. You have to enter it yourself, this step is not performed by make. And then wait for flashing to complete. **Remember this is a one-time flash, you can not change the bootloader after this!**\\n\\n7. Run ``idf.py flash`` to build and flash the partition table and the just-built app image. The app image will be signed using the signing key you generated in step 4.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  ``idf.py flash`` does not flash the bootloader if secure boot is enabled.\\n\\n8. Reset the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} and it will boot the software bootloader you flashed. The software bootloader will enable secure boot on the chip, and then it verifies the app image signature and boots the app. You should watch the serial console output from the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} to verify that secure boot is enabled and no errors have occurred due to the build configuration.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  The secure boot will not be enabled until after a valid partition table and app image have been flashed. This is to prevent accidents before the system is fully configured.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  If {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is reset or powered down during the first boot, it will start the process again on the next boot.\\n\\n9. On subsequent boots, the secure boot hardware will verify the software bootloader has not changed using the secure bootloader key, and then the software bootloader will verify the signed partition table and app image using the public key portion of the secure boot signing key.\\n\\n\\n.. _secure-boot-reflashable:\\n\\nReflashable Software Bootloader\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nConfiguration ``Secure Boot: One-Time Flash`` is the recommended configuration for production devices. In this mode, each device gets a unique key that is never stored outside the device.\\n\\nHowever, an alternative mode :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOTLOADER_MODE` is also available. This mode allows you to supply a binary key file that is used for the secure bootloader key. As you have the key file, you can generate new bootloader images and secure boot digests for them.\\n\\nIn the ESP-IDF build process, this 256-bit key file is derived from the ECDSA app signing key generated by the user, see the :ref:`secure-boot-generate-key` step below. This private key\\'s SHA-256 digest is used as the secure bootloader key in eFuse, as-is for Coding Scheme ``None``, or truncated to 192 bytes for ``3/4 Encoding``. This is a convenience so you only need to generate or protect a single private key.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  Although it is possible, we strongly recommend not generating one secure boot key and flashing it to every device in a production environment. The ``One-Time Flash`` option is recommended for production environments.\\n\\nTo enable a reflashable bootloader:\\n\\n1. In the :ref:`project-configuration-menu`, select ``Bootloader Config`` > :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT` > ``CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT_V1_ENABLED`` > :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOTLOADER_MODE` > ``Reflashable``.\\n\\n2. If necessary, set the :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOTLOADER_KEY_ENCODING` based on the coding scheme used by the device. The coding scheme is shown in the ``Features`` line when ``esptool.py`` connects to the chip, or in the ``espefuse.py summary`` output.\\n\\n3. Please follow the steps shown in :ref:`secure-boot-generate-key` to generate the signing key. The path of the generated key file must be specified in the ``Secure Boot Configuration`` menu.\\n\\n4. Run ``idf.py bootloader``. A binary key file will be created, derived from the private key that is used for signing. Two sets of flashing steps will be printed. The first set of steps includes an ``espefuse.py burn_key secure_boot_v1 path_to/secure-bootloader-key-xxx.bin`` command which is used to write the bootloader key to eFuse. Flashing this key is a one-time-only process. The second set of steps can be used to reflash the bootloader with a pre-calculated digest, which is generated during the build process.\\n\\n5. Resume from :ref:`Step 6 of the one-time flashing process <secure-boot-resume-normal-flashing>`, to flash the bootloader and enable secure boot. Watch the console log output closely to ensure there were no errors in the secure boot configuration.\\n\\n\\n.. _secure-boot-generate-key:\\n\\nGenerating Secure Boot Signing Key\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nThe build system will prompt you with a command to generate a new signing key via ``espsecure.py generate_signing_key``. This uses the python-ecdsa library, which in turn uses Python\\'s ``os.urandom()`` as a random number source.\\n\\nThe strength of the signing key is proportional to the random number source of the system, and the correctness of the algorithm used. For production devices, we recommend generating signing keys from a system with a quality entropy source and using the best available EC key generation utilities.\\n\\nFor example, to generate a signing key using the OpenSSL command line:\\n\\n.. code-block::\\n\\n  openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out my_secure_boot_signing_key.pem\\n\\nRemember that the strength of the secure boot system depends on keeping the signing key private.\\n\\n\\n.. _remote-sign-image:\\n\\nRemote Signing of Images\\n------------------------\\n\\nFor production builds, it can be good practice to use a remote signing server rather than have the signing key on the build machine, which is the default ESP-IDF secure boot configuration. The ``espsecure.py`` command line program can be used to sign app images & partition table data for secure boot, on a remote system.\\n\\nTo use remote signing, disable the option ``Sign binaries during build``. The private signing key does not need to be present on the build system. However, the public signature verification key is required because it is compiled into the bootloader, and can be used to verify image signatures during OTA updates.\\n\\nTo extract the public key from the private key:\\n\\n.. code-block::\\n\\n  espsecure.py extract_public_key --keyfile PRIVATE_SIGNING_KEY PUBLIC_VERIFICATION_KEY\\n\\nThe path to the public signature verification key needs to be specified in the menuconfig under ``Secure boot public signature verification key`` in order to build the secure bootloader.\\n\\nAfter the app image and partition table are built, the build system will print signing steps using ``espsecure.py``:\\n\\n.. code-block::\\n\\n  espsecure.py sign_data --keyfile PRIVATE_SIGNING_KEY BINARY_FILE\\n\\nThe above command appends the image signature to the existing binary. You can use the `--output` argument to write the signed binary to a separate file:\\n\\n.. code-block::\\n\\n  espsecure.py sign_data --keyfile PRIVATE_SIGNING_KEY --output SIGNED_BINARY_FILE BINARY_FILE\\n\\n\\nSecure Boot Best Practices\\n--------------------------\\n\\n* Generate the signing key on a system with a quality source of entropy.\\n* Keep the signing key private at all times. A leak of this key will compromise the secure boot system.\\n* Do not allow any third party to observe any aspects of the key generation or signing process using ``espsecure.py``. Both processes are vulnerable to timing or other side-channel attacks.\\n* Enable all secure boot options in Secure Boot Configuration. These include flash encryption, disabling of JTAG, disabling BASIC ROM interpreter, and disabling the UART bootloader encrypted flash access.\\n* Use secure boot in combination with :doc:`flash-encryption` to prevent local readout of the flash contents.\\n\\n\\n.. _secure-boot-technical-details:\\n\\nTechnical Details\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe following sections contain low-level reference descriptions of various secure boot elements:\\n\\n\\n.. _secure-boot-hardware-support:\\n\\nSecure Boot Hardware Support\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe first stage of secure boot verification, i.e., checking the software bootloader, is done via hardware. The {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s secure boot support hardware can perform three basic operations:\\n\\n1. Generate a random sequence of bytes from a hardware random number generator.\\n\\n2. Generate a digest from data, usually the bootloader image from flash, using a key stored in eFuse block 2. The key in eFuse can and should be read/write protected, which prevents software access. For full details of this algorithm see `Secure Bootloader Digest Algorithm`_. The digest can only be read back by software if eFuse ABS_DONE_0 is **not** burned, i.e., still 0.\\n\\n3. Generate a digest from data, usually the bootloader image from flash, using the same algorithm as step 2 and compare it to a pre-calculated digest supplied in a buffer, usually read from flash offset 0x0. The hardware returns a true/false comparison without making the digest available to the software. This function is available even when eFuse ABS_DONE_0 is burned.\\n\\n\\n.. _secure-bootloader-digest-algorithm:\\n\\nSecure Bootloader Digest Algorithm\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nStarting with an \"image\" of binary data as input, this algorithm generates a digest as output. The digest is sometimes referred to as an \"abstract\" in hardware documentation.\\n\\nFor a Python version of this algorithm, see the ``espsecure.py`` tool in the :component:`/esptool_py` directory. Specifically, the ``digest_secure_bootloader`` command.\\n\\nItems marked with (^) are to fulfill hardware restrictions, as opposed to cryptographic restrictions.\\n\\n1. Read the AES key from eFuse block 2, in reversed byte order. If the Coding Scheme is set to ``3/4 Encoding``, extend the 192-bit key to 256 bits using the same algorithm described in :ref:`flash-encryption-algorithm`.\\n2. Prefix the image with a 128-byte randomly generated IV.\\n3. If the image length is not modulo 128, pad the image to a 128-byte boundary with 0xFF. (^)\\n4. For each 16-byte plaintext block of the input image:\\n\\n   - Reverse the byte order of the plaintext input block. (^)\\n   - Apply AES256 in ECB mode to the plaintext block.\\n   - Reverse the byte order of the ciphertext output block. (^)\\n   - Append to the overall ciphertext output.\\n\\n5. Byte-swap each 4-byte word of the ciphertext. (^)\\n6. Calculate SHA-512 of the ciphertext.\\n7. Byte-swap each 4-byte word of the above-calculated digest. (^)\\n\\nOutput digest is 192 bytes of data: the 128-byte IV, followed by the 64-byte SHA-512 digest.\\n\\n\\n.. _secure-boot-image-signing-algorithm:\\n\\nImage Signing Algorithm\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nDeterministic ECDSA as specified by `RFC 6979 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979>`_.\\n\\n- Curve is NIST256p. OpenSSL calls this curve prime256v1, and it is also sometimes called secp256r1.\\n- The hash function is SHA256.\\n- The key format used for storage is PEM.\\n\\n  - In the bootloader, the public key for signature verification is flashed as 64 raw bytes.\\n\\n- Image signature is 68 bytes: a 4-byte version word (currently zero), followed by 64 bytes of signature data. These 68 bytes are appended to an app image or partition table data.\\n\\n\\nManual Commands\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nSecure boot is integrated into the ESP-IDF build system, so ``idf.py build`` will automatically sign an app image if secure boot is enabled. ``idf.py bootloader`` will produce a bootloader digest if menuconfig is configured for it.\\n\\nHowever, it is possible to use the ``espsecure.py`` tool to make standalone signatures and digests.\\n\\nTo sign a binary image:\\n\\n.. code-block::\\n\\n  espsecure.py sign_data --keyfile ./my_signing_key.pem --output ./image_signed.bin image-unsigned.bin\\n\\nThe keyfile is the PEM file containing an ECDSA private signing key.\\n\\nTo generate a bootloader digest:\\n\\n.. code-block::\\n\\n  espsecure.py digest_secure_bootloader --keyfile ./securebootkey.bin --output ./bootloader-digest.bin build/bootloader/bootloader.bin\\n\\nThe keyfile is the 32-byte raw secure boot key for the device.\\n\\nThe output of the ``espsecure.py digest_secure_bootloader`` command is a single file that contains both the digest and the bootloader appended to it. To flash the combined digest plus bootloader to the device:\\n\\n.. code-block::\\n\\n  esptool.py write_flash 0x0 bootloader-digest.bin\\n\\n\\n.. _secure-boot-and-flash-encr:\\n\\nSecure Boot & Flash Encryption\\n------------------------------\\n\\nIf secure boot is used without :doc:`flash-encryption`, it is possible to launch a ``time-of-check to time-of-use`` attack, where flash contents are swapped after the image is verified and running. Therefore, it is recommended to use both features together.\\n\\n\\n.. _signed-app-verify:\\n\\nSigned App Verification Without Hardware Secure Boot\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe integrity of apps can be checked even without enabling the hardware secure boot option. This option uses the same app signature scheme as hardware secure boot, but unlike hardware secure boot, it does not prevent the bootloader from being physically updated. This means that the device can be secured against remote network access, but not physical access. Compared to using hardware secure boot, this option is much simpler to implement. See :ref:`signed-app-verify-how-to` for step-by-step instructions.\\n\\nAn app can be verified on update and, optionally, be verified on boot.\\n\\n- Verification on update: When enabled, the signature is automatically checked whenever the ``esp_ota_ops.h`` APIs are used for OTA updates. If hardware secure boot is enabled, this option is always enabled and cannot be disabled. If hardware secure boot is not enabled, this option still adds significant security against network-based attackers by preventing spoofing of OTA updates.\\n\\n- Verification on boot: When enabled, the bootloader will be compiled with code to verify that an app is signed before booting it. If hardware secure boot is enabled, this option is always enabled and cannot be disabled. If hardware secure boot is not enabled, this option does not add significant security by itself so most users will want to leave it disabled.\\n\\n\\n.. _signed-app-verify-how-to:\\n\\nHow To Enable Signed App Verification\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n1. Open :ref:`project-configuration-menu` > ``Security features`` > enable :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_SIGNED_APPS_NO_SECURE_BOOT`\\n\\n2. ``Bootloader verifies app signatures`` can be enabled, which verifies app on boot.\\n\\n3. By default, ``Sign binaries during build`` will be enabled by selecting the ``Require signed app images`` option, which will sign binary files as a part of the build process. The file named ``Secure boot private signing key`` will be used to sign the image.\\n\\n4. If you disable the ``Sign binaries during build`` option then you will have to enter the path of a public key file used to verify signed images in the ``Secure boot public signature verification key``.\\n\\n   In this case, the private signing key should be generated by following instructions in :ref:`secure-boot-generate-key`; the public verification key and signed image should be generated by following instructions in :ref:`remote-sign-image`.\\n\\n\\nAdvanced Features\\n-----------------\\n\\nJTAG Debugging\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nBy default, when secure boot is enabled, JTAG debugging is disabled via eFuse. The bootloader does this on the first boot, at the same time it enables secure boot.\\n\\nSee :ref:`jtag-debugging-security-features` for more information about using JTAG Debugging with either secure boot or signed app verification enabled.\\n',\n",

It is recommended that users use Secure Boot V2 if they have a chip version that supports it.

To use these options in menuconfig, set :ref:`CONFIG_ESP32C3_REV_MIN` greater than or equal to `Rev 3`.\\n\\nBackground\\n----------\\n\\nSecure Boot protects a device from running any unauthorized (i.e., unsigned) code by checking that each piece of software that is being booted is signed. On an {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, these pieces of software include the second stage bootloader and each application binary. Note that the first stage bootloader does not require signing as it is ROM code thus cannot be changed.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or (SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_RSA and not SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_ECC)\\n\\n    A RSA based Secure Boot verification scheme (Secure Boot V2) is implemented on {IDF_TARGET_NAME} {IDF_TARGET_ECO_VERSION}.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_ECC and not SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_RSA\\n\\n    A ECC based Secure Boot verification scheme (Secure Boot V2) has been introduce on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_RSA and SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_ECC\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has provision to choose between a {IDF_TARGET_SBV2_SCHEME} based secure boot verification scheme.\\n\\nThe Secure Boot process on the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} involves the following steps:\\n\\n1. When the first stage bootloader loads the second stage bootloader, the second stage bootloader\\'s {IDF_TARGET_SBV2_SCHEME} signature is verified. If the verification is successful, the second stage bootloader is executed.\\n\\n2. When the second stage bootloader loads a particular application image, the application\\'s {IDF_TARGET_SBV2_SCHEME} signature is verified. If the verification is successful, the application image is executed.\\n\\nAdvantages\\n----------\\n\\n- The {IDF_TARGET_SBV2_SCHEME} public key is stored on the device. The corresponding {IDF_TARGET_SBV2_SCHEME} private key is kept at a secret place and is never accessed by the device.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32c2\\n\\n    - Only one public key can be generated and stored in the chip during manufacturing.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_EFUSE_REVOKE_BOOT_KEY_DIGESTS\\n\\n    - Up to three public keys can be generated and stored in the chip during manufacturing.\\n\\n    - {IDF_TARGET_NAME} provides the facility to permanently revoke individual public keys. This can be configured conservatively or aggressively.\\n\\n    - Conservatively - The old key is revoked after the bootloader and application have successfully migrated to a new key. Aggressively - The key is revoked as soon as verification with this key fails.\\n\\n- Same image format and signature verification method is applied for applications and software bootloader.\\n\\n- No secrets are stored on the device. Therefore, it is immune to passive side-channel attacks (timing or power analysis, etc.)\\n\\n\\nSecure Boot V2 Process\\n----------------------\\n\\nThis is an overview of the Secure Boot V2 Process. Instructions how to enable Secure Boot are supplied in section :ref:`secure-boot-v2-howto`.\\n\\nSecure Boot V2 verifies the bootloader image and application binary images using a dedicated *signature block*. Each image has a separately generated signature block which is appended to the end of the image.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n  Only one signature block can be appended to the bootloader or application image in ESP32 ECO3.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c2\\n\\n  Only one signature block can be appended to the bootloader or application image in {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_EFUSE_REVOKE_BOOT_KEY_DIGESTS\\n\\n  Up to 3 signature blocks can be appended to the bootloader or application image in {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.\\n\\nEach signature block contains a signature of the preceding image as well as the corresponding {IDF_TARGET_SBV2_KEY} public key. For more details about the format, refer to :ref:`signature-block-format`. A digest of the {IDF_TARGET_SBV2_KEY} public key is stored in the eFuse.\\n\\nThe application image is not only verified on every boot but also on each over the air (OTA) update. If the currently selected OTA app image cannot be verified, the bootloader will fall back and look for another correctly signed application image.\\n\\nThe Secure Boot V2 process follows these steps:\\n\\n1. On startup, the ROM code checks the Secure Boot V2 bit in the eFuse. If Secure Boot is disabled, a normal boot will be executed. If Secure Boot is enabled, the boot will proceed according to the following steps.\\n\\n2. The ROM code verifies the bootloader\\'s signature block (:ref:`verify_signature-block`). If this fails, the boot process will be aborted.\\n\\n3. The ROM code verifies the bootloader image using the raw image data, its corresponding signature block(s), and the eFuse (:ref:`verify_image`). If this fails, the boot process will be aborted.\\n\\n4. The ROM code executes the bootloader.\\n\\n5. The bootloader verifies the application image\\'s signature block (:ref:`verify_signature-block`). If this fails, the boot process will be aborted.\\n\\n6. The bootloader verifies the application image using the raw image data, its corresponding signature blocks and the eFuse (:ref:`verify_image`). If this fails, the boot process will be aborted. If the verification fails but another application image is found, the bootloader will then try to verify that other image using steps 5 to 7. This repeats until a valid image is found or no other images are found.\\n\\n7. The bootloader executes the verified application image.\\n\\n.. _signature-block-format:\\n\\nSignature Block Format\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe signature block starts on a 4 KB aligned boundary and has a flash sector of its own. The signature is calculated over all bytes in the image including the padding bytes (:ref:`secure_padding`).\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_RSA and SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_ECC\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has a provision to choose between RSA scheme and ECDSA scheme. Only one scheme can be used per device.\\n\\n        ECDSA provides similar security strength, compared to RSA, with shorter key lengths. Current estimates are that ECDSA with curve P-256 has an approximate equivalent strength to RSA with 3072-bit keys. However, ECDSA signature verification takes considerably more amount of time as compared to RSA signature verification.\\n\\n        RSA is recommended for use cases where fast bootup time is required whereas ECDSA is recommended for use cases where shorter key length is required.\\n\\n        .. only:: not esp32p4\\n\\n            .. list-table:: Comparison between signature verification time\\n                :widths: 10 10 20\\n                :header-rows: 1\\n\\n                * - **Verification scheme**\\n                  - **Time**\\n                  - **CPU Frequency**\\n                * - RSA-3072\\n                  - {IDF_TARGET_RSA_TIME}\\n                  - {IDF_TARGET_CPU_FREQ}\\n                * - ECDSA-P256\\n                  - {IDF_TARGET_ECDSA_TIME}\\n                  - {IDF_TARGET_CPU_FREQ}\\n\\n          The above table compares the time taken to verify a signature in a particular scheme.

This is known as secure padding. Signature of the image is calculated after padding and then signature block (4KB) gets appended to the image.\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - Default flash MMU page size is 64KB\\n    :SOC_MMU_PAGE_SIZE_CONFIGURABLE: - {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports configurable flash MMU page size, it (``CONFIG_MMU_PAGE_SIZE``) gets set based on the :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE`\\n    - Secure padding is applied through the option ``--secure-pad-v2`` in the ``elf2image`` conversion using ``esptool.py``\\n\\nFollowing table explains the Secure Boot V2 signed image with secure padding and signature block appended:\\n\\n.. list-table:: Contents of a signed application\\n        :widths: 20 20 20\\n        :header-rows: 1\\n\\n        * - **Offset**\\n          - **Size (KB)**\\n          - **Description**\\n        * - 0\\n          - 580\\n          - Unsigned application size (as an example)\\n        * - 580\\n          - 60\\n          - Secure padding (aligned to next 64KB boundary)\\n        * - 640\\n          - 4\\n          - Signature block\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Please note that the application image always starts on the next flash MMU page size boundary (default 64KB) and hence the space left over after the signature block shown above can be utilized to store any other data partitions (e.g., ``nvs``).\\n\\n.. _verify_signature-block:\\n\\nVerifying a Signature Block\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nA signature block is \"valid\" if the first byte is 0xe7 and a valid CRC32 is stored at offset 1196.

Compare the SHA-256 hash digest of the public key embedded in the bootloader\\'s signature block with the digest(s) saved in the eFuses. If public key\\'s hash does not match any of the hashes from the eFuses, the verification fails.\\n\\n2.

See :ref:`bootloader-size`.\\n\\nIn the case when :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT_BUILD_SIGNED_BINARIES` is disabled, the bootloader is sector padded (4KB) using the ``--pad-to-size`` option in ``elf2image`` command of ``esptool``.\\n\\n.. _efuse-usage:\\n\\neFuse Usage\\n-----------\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    ESP32-ECO3:\\n\\n    - ABS_DONE_1 - Enables Secure Boot protection on boot.\\n\\n    - BLK2 - Stores the SHA-256 digest of the public key.

Example: If KEY_PURPOSE_2 is set to SECURE_BOOT_DIGEST1, then BLOCK_KEY2 will have the Secure Boot V2 public key digest. The write-protection bit must be set (this field does not have a read-protection bit).\\n\\n    - BLOCK_KEYX - The block contains the data corresponding to its purpose programmed in KEY_PURPOSE_X.

Setting KEY_REVOKE2 revokes the key block whose key purpose is SECURE_BOOT_DIGEST2.\\n\\n    - SECURE_BOOT_AGGRESSIVE_REVOKE - Enables aggressive revocation of keys. The key is revoked as soon as verification with this key fails.\\n\\n    To ensure no trusted keys can be added later by an attacker, each unused key digest slot should be revoked (KEY_REVOKEX). It will be checked during app startup in :cpp:func:`esp_secure_boot_init_checks` and fixed unless :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT_ALLOW_UNUSED_DIGEST_SLOTS` is enabled.\\n\\nThe key(s) must be readable in order to give software access to it. If the key(s) is read-protected then the software reads the key(s) as all zeros and the signature verification process will fail, and the boot process will be aborted.\\n\\n.. _secure-boot-v2-howto:\\n\\nHow To Enable Secure Boot V2\\n----------------------------\\n\\n1. Open the :ref:`project-configuration-menu`, in \"Security features\" set \"Enable hardware Secure Boot in bootloader\" to enable Secure Boot.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    2. For ESP32, Secure Boot V2 is available only ESP32 ECO3 onwards. To view the \"Secure Boot V2\" option the chip revision should be changed to revision 3 (ESP32- ECO3). To change the chip revision, set \"Minimum Supported ESP32 Revision\" to Rev 3 in \"Component Config\" -> \"ESP32- Specific\".\\n\\n    3. Specify the path to Secure Boot signing key, relative to the project directory.\\n\\n    4. Select the desired UART ROM download mode in \"UART ROM download mode\". By default the UART ROM download mode has been kept enabled in order to prevent permanently disabling it in the development phase, this option is a potentially insecure option. It is recommended to disable the UART download mode for better security.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_RSA or SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_ECC\\n\\n    2. The \"Secure Boot V2\" option will be selected and the \"App Signing Scheme\" would be set to {IDF_TARGET_SBV2_DEFAULT_SCHEME} by default. {IDF_TARGET_SECURE_BOOT_OPTION_TEXT}\\n\\n    3. Specify the path to Secure Boot signing key, relative to the project directory.\\n\\n    4. Select the desired UART ROM download mode in \"UART ROM download mode\". By default, it is set to \"Permanently switch to Secure mode\" which is generally recommended. For production devices, the most secure option is to set it to \"Permanently disabled\".\\n\\n5. Set other menuconfig options (as desired). Then exit menuconfig and save your configuration.\\n\\n6. The first time you run ``idf.py build``, if the signing key is not found then an error message will be printed with a command to generate a signing key via ``espsecure.py generate_signing_key``.\\n\\n.. important::\\n   A signing key generated this way will use the best random number source available to the OS and its Python installation (`/dev/urandom` on OSX/Linux and `CryptGenRandom()` on Windows). If this random number source is weak, then the private key will be weak.\\n\\n.. important::\\n   For production environments, we recommend generating the key pair using openssl or another industry standard encryption program. See :ref:`secure-boot-v2-generate-key` for more details.\\n\\n7. Run ``idf.py bootloader`` to build a Secure Boot enabled bootloader. The build output will include a prompt for a flashing command, using ``esptool.py write_flash``.\\n\\n8. When you are ready to flash the bootloader, run the specified command (you have to enter it yourself, this step is not performed by the build system) and then wait for flashing to complete.\\n\\n9. Run ``idf.py flash`` to build and flash the partition table and the just-built app image. The app image will be signed using the signing key you generated in step 6.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  ``idf.py flash`` does not flash the bootloader if Secure Boot is enabled.\\n\\n10. Reset the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} and it will boot the software bootloader you flashed. The software bootloader will enable Secure Boot on the chip, and then it verifies the app image signature and boots the app. You should watch the serial console output from the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} to verify that Secure Boot is enabled and no errors have occurred due to the build configuration.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  Secure boot will not be enabled until after a valid partition table and app image have been flashed. This is to prevent accidents before the system is fully configured.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  If the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is reset or powered down during the first boot, it will start the process again on the next boot.\\n\\n11. On subsequent boots, the Secure Boot hardware will verify the software bootloader has not changed and the software bootloader will verify the signed app image (using the validated public key portion of its appended signature block).\\n\\nRestrictions After Secure Boot Is Enabled\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\n- Any updated bootloader or app will need to be signed with a key matching the digest already stored in eFuse.\\n\\n- After Secure Boot is enabled, no further eFuses can be read protected. (If :doc:`/security/flash-encryption` is enabled then the bootloader will ensure that any flash encryption key generated on first boot will already be read protected.) If :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT_INSECURE` is enabled then this behavior can be disabled, but this is not recommended.\\n\\n- Please note that enabling Secure Boot or flash encryption disables the USB-OTG USB stack in the ROM, disallowing updates via the serial emulation or Device Firmware Update (DFU) on that port.\\n\\n.. _secure-boot-v2-generate-key:\\n\\nGenerating Secure Boot Signing Key\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nThe build system will prompt you with a command to generate a new signing key via ``espsecure.py generate_signing_key``.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_RSA\\n\\n   The ``--version 2`` parameter will generate the RSA 3072 private key for Secure Boot V2. Additionally ``--scheme rsa3072`` can be passed as well to generate RSA 3072 private key\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_ECC\\n\\n   Select the ECDSA scheme by passing ``--version 2 --scheme ecdsa256`` or ``--version 2 --scheme ecdsa192`` to generate corresponding ECDSA private key\\n\\nThe strength of the signing key is proportional to (a) the random number source of the system, and (b) the correctness of the algorithm used. For production devices, we recommend generating signing keys from a system with a quality entropy source, and using the best available {IDF_TARGET_SBV2_SCHEME} key generation utilities.\\n\\nFor example, to generate a signing key using the openssl command line:\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_RSA\\n\\n    For RSA 3072\\n\\n    ```\\n    openssl genrsa -out my_secure_boot_signing_key.pem 3072\\n    ```\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V2_ECC\\n\\n    For ECC NIST192p curve\\n\\n    ```\\n    openssl ecparam -name prime192v1 -genkey -noout -out my_secure_boot_signing_key.pem\\n    ```\\n\\n    For ECC NIST256p curve\\n\\n    ```\\n    openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out my_secure_boot_signing_key.pem\\n    ```\\n\\nRemember that the strength of the Secure Boot system depends on keeping the signing key private.\\n\\n.. _remote-sign-v2-image:\\n\\nRemote Signing of Images\\n------------------------\\n\\nSigning Using ``espsecure.py``\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nFor production builds, it can be good practice to use a remote signing server rather than have the signing key on the build machine (which is the default esp-idf Secure Boot configuration). The espsecure.py command line program can be used to sign app images & partition table data for Secure Boot, on a remote system.\\n\\nTo use remote signing, disable the option :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT_BUILD_SIGNED_BINARIES` and build the firmware. The private signing key does not need to be present on the build system.\\n\\nAfter the app image and partition table are built, the build system will print signing steps using espsecure.py::\\n\\n  espsecure.py sign_data BINARY_FILE --version 2 --keyfile PRIVATE_SIGNING_KEY\\n\\nThe above command appends the image signature to the existing binary. You can use the `--output` argument to write the signed binary to a separate file::\\n\\n  espsecure.py sign_data --version 2 --keyfile PRIVATE_SIGNING_KEY --output SIGNED_BINARY_FILE BINARY_FILE\\n\\nSigning Using Pre-calculated Signatures\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIf you have valid pre-calculated signatures generated for an image and their corresponding public keys, you can use these signatures to generate a signature sector and append it to the image. Note that the pre-calculated signature should be calculated over all bytes in the image including the secure-padding bytes.\\n\\nIn such cases, the firmware image should be built by disabling the option :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT_BUILD_SIGNED_BINARIES`. This image will be secure-padded and to generate a signed binary use the following command::\\n\\n  espsecure.py sign_data --version 2 --pub-key PUBLIC_SIGNING_KEY --signature SIGNATURE_FILE --output SIGNED_BINARY_FILE BINARY_FILE\\n\\nThe above command verifies the signature, generates a signature block (refer to :ref:`signature-block-format`) and appends it to the binary file.\\n\\n\\nSigning Using an External Hardware Security Module (HSM)\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nFor security reasons, you might also use an external Hardware Security Module (HSM) to store your private signing key, which cannot be accessed directly but has an interface to generate the signature of a binary file and its corresponding public key.\\n\\nIn such cases, disable the option :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT_BUILD_SIGNED_BINARIES` and build the firmware. This secure-padded image then can be used to supply the external HSM for generating a signature. Refer to `Signing using an External HSM <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/{IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}/espsecure/index.html#remote-signing-using-an-external-hsm>`_ to generate a signed image.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_EFUSE_REVOKE_BOOT_KEY_DIGESTS\\n\\n    .. note:: For all the above three remote signing workflows, the signed binary is written to the filename provided to the ``--output`` argument and the option ``--append_signatures`` allows us to append multiple signatures (up to 3) the image.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_EFUSE_REVOKE_BOOT_KEY_DIGESTS\\n\\n    .. note:: For all the above three remote signing workflows, the signed binary is written to the filename provided to the ``--output`` argument.\\n\\n\\n\\nSecure Boot Best Practices\\n--------------------------\\n\\n* Generate the signing key on a system with a quality source of entropy.\\n* Keep the signing key private at all times. A leak of this key will compromise the Secure Boot system.\\n* Do not allow any third party to observe any aspects of the key generation or signing process using espsecure.py. Both processes are vulnerable to timing or other side-channel attacks.\\n* Enable all Secure Boot options in the Secure Boot Configuration. These include flash encryption, disabling of JTAG, disabling BASIC ROM interpreter, and disabling the UART bootloader encrypted flash access.\\n* Use Secure Boot in combination with :doc:`flash-encryption` to prevent local readout of the flash contents.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_EFUSE_REVOKE_BOOT_KEY_DIGESTS\\n\\n    Key Management\\n    --------------\\n\\n    * Between 1 and 3 {IDF_TARGET_SBV2_KEY} public key pairs (Keys #0, #1, #2) should be computed independently and stored separately.\\n    * The KEY_DIGEST eFuses should be write protected after being programmed.\\n    * The unused KEY_DIGEST slots must have their corresponding KEY_REVOKE eFuse burned to permanently disable them. This must happen before the device leaves the factory.\\n    * The eFuses can either be written by the software bootloader during during first boot after enabling \"Secure Boot V2\" from menuconfig or can be done using `espefuse.py` which communicates with the serial bootloader program in ROM.\\n    * The KEY_DIGESTs should be numbered sequentially beginning at key digest #0. (i.e., if key digest #1 is used, key digest #0 should be used. If key digest #2 is used, key digest #0 & #1 must be used.)\\n    * The software bootloader (non OTA upgradeable) is signed using at least one, possibly all three, private keys and flashed in the factory.\\n    * Apps should only be signed with a single private key (the others being stored securely elsewhere), however they may be signed with multiple private keys if some are being revoked (see Key Revocation, below).\\n\\n    Multiple Keys\\n    -------------\\n\\n    * The bootloader should be signed with all the private key(s) that are needed for the life of the device, before it is flashed.\\n    * The build system can sign with at most one private key, user has to run manual commands to append more signatures if necessary.\\n    * You can use the append functionality of ``espsecure.py``, this command would also printed at the end of the Secure Boot V2 enabled bootloader compilation.\\n        espsecure.py sign_data -k secure_boot_signing_key2.pem -v 2 --append_signatures -o signed_bootloader.bin build/bootloader/bootloader.bin\\n    * While signing with multiple private keys, it is recommended that the private keys be signed independently, if possible on different servers and stored separately.\\n    * You can check the signatures attached to a binary using -\\n        espsecure.py signature_info_v2 datafile.bin\\n\\n    Key Revocation\\n    --------------\\n\\n    * Keys are processed in a linear order. (key #0, key #1, key #2).\\n    * Applications should be signed with only one key at a time, to minimize the exposure of unused private keys.\\n    * The bootloader can be signed with multiple keys from the factory.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Note that enabling the config :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT_ALLOW_UNUSED_DIGEST_SLOTS` only makes sure that the **app** does not revoke the unused digest slots.\\n        But if you plan to enable secure boot during the fist boot up, the bootloader will intentionally revoke the unused digest slots while enabling secure boot, even if the above config is enabled because keeping the unused key slots un-revoked would a security hazard.\\n        In case for any development workflow if you need to avoid this revocation, you should enable secure boot externally (:ref:`enable-secure-boot-v2-externally`) rather than enabling it during the boot up, so that the bootloader would not need to enable secure boot and thus you could avoid its revocation strategy.\\n\\n    Conservative Approach:\\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n    Assuming a trusted private key (N-1) has been compromised, to update to new key pair (N).\\n\\n    1. Server sends an OTA update with an application signed with the new private key (#N).\\n    2. The new OTA update is written to an unused OTA app partition.\\n    3. The new application\\'s signature block is validated. The public keys are checked against the digests programmed in the eFuse & the application is verified using the verified public key.\\n    4. The active partition is set to the new OTA application\\'s partition.\\n    5. Device resets, loads the bootloader (verified with key #N-1 and #N) which then boots new app (verified with key #N).\\n    6. The new app verifies bootloader and application with key #N (as a final check) and then runs code to revoke key #N-1 (sets KEY_REVOKE eFuse bit).\\n    7. The API `esp_ota_revoke_secure_boot_public_key()` can be used to revoke the key #N-1.\\n\\n    * A similar approach can also be used to physically re-flash with a new key. For physical re-flashing, the bootloader content can also be changed at the same time.\\n\\n    .. _secure-boot-v2-aggressive-key-revocation:\\n\\n    Aggressive Approach:\\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n    ROM code has an additional feature of revoking a public key digest if the signature verification fails.\\n\\n    To enable this feature, you need to burn SECURE_BOOT_AGGRESSIVE_REVOKE efuse or enable :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE_AGGRESSIVE_KEY_REVOKE`\\n\\n    Key revocation is not applicable unless secure boot is successfully enabled. Also, a key is not revoked in case of invalid signature block or invalid image digest, it is only revoked in case the signature verification fails, i.e., revoke key only if failure in step 3 of :ref:`verify_image`\\n\\n    Once a key is revoked, it can never be used for verfying a signature of an image. This feature provides strong resistance against physical attacks on the device. However, this could also brick the device permanently if all the keys are revoked because of signature verification failure.\\n\\n.. _secure-boot-v2-technical-details:\\n\\nTechnical Details\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe following sections contain low-level reference descriptions of various Secure Boot elements:\\n\\nManual Commands\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nSecure boot is integrated into the esp-idf build system, so ``idf.py build`` will sign an app image and ``idf.py bootloader`` will produce a signed bootloader if secure signed binaries on build is enabled.\\n\\nHowever, it is possible to use the ``espsecure.py`` tool to make standalone signatures and digests.\\n\\nTo sign a binary image::\\n\\n  espsecure.py sign_data --version 2 --keyfile ./my_signing_key.pem --output ./image_signed.bin image-unsigned.bin\\n\\nKeyfile is the PEM file containing an {IDF_TARGET_SBV2_KEY} private signing key.\\n\\n.. _secure-boot-v2-and-flash-encr:\\n\\nSecure Boot & Flash Encryption\\n------------------------------\\n\\nIf Secure Boot is used without :doc:`flash-encryption`, it is possible to launch \"time-of-check to time-of-use\" attack, where flash contents are swapped after the image is verified and running. Therefore, it is recommended to use both the features together.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c2\\n\\n    .. important::\\n       {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has only one eFuse key block, which is used for both keys: Secure Boot and Flash Encryption. The eFuse key block can only be burned once. Therefore these keys should be burned together at the same time. Please note that \"Secure Boot\" and \"Flash Encryption\" can not be enabled separately as subsequent writes to eFuse key block shall return an error.\\n\\n.. _signed-app-verify-v2:\\n\\nSigned App Verification Without Hardware Secure Boot\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Secure Boot V2 signature of apps can be checked on OTA update, without enabling the hardware Secure Boot option. This option uses the same app signature scheme as Secure Boot V2, but unlike hardware Secure Boot it does not prevent an attacker who can write to flash from bypassing the signature protection.\\n\\nThis may be desirable in cases where the delay of Secure Boot verification on startup is unacceptable, and/or where the threat model does not include physical access or attackers writing to bootloader or app partitions in flash.\\n\\nIn this mode, the public key which is present in the signature block of the currently running app will be used to verify the signature of a newly updated app. (The signature on the running app is not verified during the update process, it is assumed to be valid.) In this way the system creates a chain of trust from the running app to the newly updated app.\\n\\nFor this reason, it is essential that the initial app flashed to the device is also signed. A check is run on app startup and the app will abort if no signatures are found. This is to try and prevent a situation where no update is possible. The app should have only one valid signature block in the first position. Note again that, unlike hardware Secure Boot V2, the signature of the running app is not verified on boot. The system only verifies a signature block in the first position and ignores any other appended signatures.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n    Although multiple trusted keys are supported when using hardware Secure Boot, only the first public key in the signature block is used to verify updates if signature checking without Secure Boot is configured. If multiple trusted public keys are required, it is necessary to enable the full Secure Boot feature instead.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   In general, it is recommended to use full hardware Secure Boot unless certain that this option is sufficient for application security needs.\\n\\n.. _signed-app-verify-v2-howto:\\n\\nHow To Enable Signed App Verification\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n1.

On the first power-on reset, all data in flash is un-encrypted (plaintext). The ROM bootloader loads the firmware bootloader.\\n\\n  2. Firmware bootloader reads the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` eFuse value (``0b0000000``). Since the value is ``0`` (even number of bits set), it configures and enables the flash encryption block. It also sets the ``FLASH_CRYPT_CONFIG`` eFuse to 0xF. For more information on the flash encryption block, see *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* > *eFuse Controller (eFuse)* > *Flash Encryption Block* [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#efuse>`__].\\n\\n  3. Fimware bootloader first checks if a valid key is already present in the eFuse (e.g., burned using espefuse tool), then the process of key generation is skipped and the same key is used for flash encryption process. Otherwise, Firmware bootloader uses RNG (random) module to generate an AES-256 bit key and then writes it into the ``flash_encryption`` eFuse. The key cannot be accessed via software as the write and read protection bits for the ``flash_encryption`` eFuse are set. The flash encryption operations happen entirely by hardware, and the key cannot be accessed via software.\\n\\n  4. Flash encryption block encrypts the flash contents - the firmware bootloader, applications and partitions marked as ``encrypted``. Encrypting in-place can take time, up to a minute for large partitions.\\n\\n  5. Firmware bootloader sets the first available bit in ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` (0b0000001) to mark the flash contents as encrypted. Odd number of bits is set.\\n\\n  6. For :ref:`flash-enc-development-mode`, the firmware bootloader sets only the eFuse bits ``DISABLE_DL_DECRYPT`` and ``DISABLE_DL_CACHE`` to allow the UART bootloader to re-flash encrypted binaries. Also, the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` eFuse bits are NOT write-protected.\\n\\n  7. For :ref:`flash-enc-release-mode`, the firmware bootloader sets the eFuse bits ``DISABLE_DL_ENCRYPT``, ``DISABLE_DL_DECRYPT``, and ``DISABLE_DL_CACHE`` to 1 to prevent the UART bootloader from decrypting the flash contents. It also write-protects the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` eFuse bits. To modify this behavior, see :ref:`uart-bootloader-encryption`.\\n\\n  8. The device is then rebooted to start executing the encrypted image. The firmware bootloader calls the flash decryption block to decrypt the flash contents and then loads the decrypted contents into IRAM.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_XTS_AES_256\\n\\n  1.

Firmware bootloader first checks if a valid key is already present in the eFuse (e.g., burned using espefuse tool) then the process of key generation is skipped and the same key is used for flash encryption process. Otherwise, Firmware bootloader uses RNG (random) module to generate an 256 bit or 512 bit key, depending on the value of :ref:`Size of generated XTS-AES key <CONFIG_SECURE_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_KEYSIZE>`, and then writes it into respectively one or two `BLOCK_KEYN` eFuses. The software also updates the ``KEY_PURPOSE_N`` for the blocks where the keys were stored. The key cannot be accessed via software as the write and read protection bits for one or two `BLOCK_KEYN` eFuses are set. ``KEY_PURPOSE_N`` field is write-protected as well. The flash encryption operations happen entirely by hardware, and the key cannot be accessed via software.\\n\\n  4.

For :ref:`flash-enc-development-mode`, the firmware bootloader allows the UART bootloader to re-flash encrypted binaries. Also, the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` eFuse bits are NOT write-protected. In addition, the firmware bootloader by default sets the following eFuse bits:\\n\\n    .. list::\\n\\n      :esp32s2: - ``DIS_BOOT_REMAP``\\n      - ``DIS_DOWNLOAD_ICACHE``\\n      - ``DIS_DOWNLOAD_DCACHE``\\n      - ``HARD_DIS_JTAG``\\n      - ``DIS_LEGACY_SPI_BOOT``\\n\\n  7. For :ref:`flash-enc-release-mode`, the firmware bootloader sets all the eFuse bits set under development mode as well as ``DIS_DOWNLOAD_MANUAL_ENCRYPT``. It also write-protects the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` eFuse bits. To modify this behavior, see :ref:`uart-bootloader-encryption`.\\n\\n  8. The device is then rebooted to start executing the encrypted image. The firmware bootloader calls the flash decryption block to decrypt the flash contents and then loads the decrypted contents into IRAM.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_XTS_AES_128 and not SOC_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_XTS_AES_256 and not SOC_EFUSE_CONSISTS_OF_ONE_KEY_BLOCK\\n\\n  1. On the first power-on reset, all data in flash is un-encrypted (plaintext). The ROM bootloader loads the firmware bootloader.\\n\\n  2. Firmware bootloader reads the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` eFuse value (``0b000``). Since the value is ``0`` (even number of bits set), it configures and enables the flash encryption block. For more information on the flash encryption block, see `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}>`_.\\n\\n  3. Firmware bootloader uses RNG (random) module to generate an 256 bit key and then writes it into `BLOCK_KEYN` eFuse. The software also updates the ``KEY_PURPOSE_N`` for the block where the key is stored. The key cannot be accessed via software as the write and read protection bits for `BLOCK_KEYN` eFuse are set. ``KEY_PURPOSE_N`` field is write-protected as well. The flash encryption is completely conducted by hardware, and the key cannot be accessed via software. If a valid key is already present in the eFuse (e.g., burned using espefuse tool) then the process of key generation is skipped and the same key is used for flash encryption process.\\n\\n  4. Flash encryption block encrypts the flash contents - the firmware bootloader, applications and partitions marked as ``encrypted``. Encrypting in-place can take time, up to a minute for large partitions.\\n\\n  5. Firmware bootloader sets the first available bit in ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` (0b001) to mark the flash contents as encrypted. Odd number of bits is set.\\n\\n  6. For :ref:`flash-enc-development-mode`, the firmware bootloader allows the UART bootloader to re-flash encrypted binaries. Also, the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` eFuse bits are NOT write-protected. In addition, the firmware bootloader by default sets the eFuse bits ``DIS_DOWNLOAD_ICACHE``, ``DIS_PAD_JTAG``, ``DIS_USB_JTAG`` and ``DIS_LEGACY_SPI_BOOT``.\\n\\n  7. For :ref:`flash-enc-release-mode`, the firmware bootloader sets all the eFuse bits set under development mode as well as ``DIS_DOWNLOAD_MANUAL_ENCRYPT``. It also write-protects the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` eFuse bits. To modify this behavior, see :ref:`uart-bootloader-encryption`.\\n\\n  8. The device is then rebooted to start executing the encrypted image. The firmware bootloader calls the flash decryption block to decrypt the flash contents and then loads the decrypted contents into IRAM.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_XTS_AES_128 and SOC_EFUSE_CONSISTS_OF_ONE_KEY_BLOCK\\n\\n  1.

Firmware bootloader reads the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` eFuse value (``0b000``). Since the value is ``0`` (even number of bits set), it configures and enables the flash encryption block. For more information on the flash encryption block, see `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}>`_.\\n\\n  3. Firmware bootloader uses RNG (random) module to generate an 256 or 128 bit key (depends on :ref:`Size of generated XTS-AES key <CONFIG_SECURE_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_KEYSIZE>`) and then writes it into `BLOCK_KEY0` eFuse. The software also updates the ``XTS_KEY_LENGTH_256`` according to the chosen option. The key cannot be accessed via software as the write and read protection bits for ``BLOCK_KEY0`` eFuse are set. The flash encryption operations happen entirely by hardware, and the key cannot be accessed via software. If 128-bit flash encryption key is used, then only the lower 128 bits of the eFuse key block are read-protected, the remaining 128 bits are readable, which is required for secure boot. The entire eFuse block is write-protected. If the FE key is 256 bits long, then ``XTS_KEY_LENGTH_256`` is 1, otherwise it is 0. To prevent this eFuse from being accidentally changed in the future (from 0 to 1), we set a write-protect bit for the RELEASE mode. If a valid key is already present in the eFuse (e.g., burned using espefuse tool) then the process of key generation is skipped and the same key is used for flash encryption process.\\n\\n  4. Flash encryption block encrypts the flash contents - the firmware bootloader, applications and partitions marked as ``encrypted``.

Firmware bootloader sets the first available bit in ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` (0b001) to mark the flash contents as encrypted. Odd number of bits is set.\\n\\n  6. For :ref:`flash-enc-development-mode`, the firmware bootloader allows the UART bootloader to re-flash encrypted binaries. Also, the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` eFuse bits are NOT write-protected. In addition, the firmware bootloader by default sets the eFuse bits ``DIS_DOWNLOAD_ICACHE``, ``DIS_PAD_JTAG``, and ``DIS_DIRECT_BOOT``.\\n\\n  7. For :ref:`flash-enc-release-mode`, the firmware bootloader sets all the eFuse bits set under development mode as well as ``DIS_DOWNLOAD_MANUAL_ENCRYPT``. It also write-protects the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` eFuse bits. To modify this behavior, see :ref:`uart-bootloader-encryption`.\\n\\n  8. The device is then rebooted to start executing the encrypted image. The firmware bootloader calls the flash decryption block to decrypt the flash contents and then loads the decrypted contents into IRAM.\\n\\nDuring the development stage, there is a frequent need to program different plaintext flash images and test the flash encryption process. This requires that Firmware Download mode is able to load new plaintext images as many times as it might be needed. However, during manufacturing or production stages, Firmware Download mode should not be allowed to access flash contents for security reasons.\\n\\nHence, two different flash encryption configurations were created: for development and for production. For details on these configurations, see Section `Flash Encryption Configuration`_.\\n\\n\\n\\nFlash Encryption Configuration\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThe following flash encryption modes are available:\\n\\n- :ref:`flash-enc-development-mode` - recommended for use only during development. In this mode, it is still possible to flash new plaintext firmware to the device, and the bootloader will transparently encrypt this firmware using the key stored in hardware. This allows, indirectly, to read out the plaintext of the firmware in flash.\\n- :ref:`flash-enc-release-mode` - recommended for manufacturing and production. In this mode, flashing plaintext firmware to the device without knowing the encryption key is no longer possible.\\n\\nThis section provides information on the mentioned flash encryption modes and step by step instructions on how to use them.\\n\\n.. _flash-enc-development-mode:\\n\\nDevelopment Mode\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nDuring development, you can encrypt flash using either an {IDF_TARGET_NAME} generated key or external host-generated key.\\n\\n\\nUsing {IDF_TARGET_NAME} Generated Key\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nDevelopment mode allows you to download multiple plaintext images using Firmware Download mode.\\n\\nTo test flash encryption process, take the following steps:\\n\\n1. Ensure that you have an {IDF_TARGET_NAME} device with default flash encryption eFuse settings as shown in :ref:`flash-encryption-efuse`.\\n\\n  See how to check :ref:`flash-encryption-status`.\\n\\n2. In :ref:`project-configuration-menu`, do the following:\\n\\n  .. list::\\n\\n    - :ref:`Enable flash encryption on boot <CONFIG_SECURE_FLASH_ENC_ENABLED>`.\\n    - :ref:`Select encryption mode <CONFIG_SECURE_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_MODE>` (**Development mode** by default).\\n    :esp32: - :ref:`Select UART ROM download mode <CONFIG_SECURE_UART_ROM_DL_MODE>` (**enabled** by default). Note that for the ESP32 target, the choice is only available when :ref:`CONFIG_ESP32_REV_MIN` level is set to 3 (ESP32 V3).\\n    :not esp32: - :ref:`Select UART ROM download mode <CONFIG_SECURE_UART_ROM_DL_MODE>` (**enabled** by default).\\n    :esp32s2 or esp32s3 or esp32c2: - Set :ref:`Size of generated XTS-AES key <CONFIG_SECURE_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_KEYSIZE>`.\\n    - :ref:`Select the appropriate bootloader log verbosity <CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_LOG_LEVEL>`.\\n    - Save the configuration and exit.\\n\\nEnabling flash encryption will increase the size of bootloader, which might require updating partition table offset. See :ref:`bootloader-size`.\\n\\n3. Run the command given below to build and flash the complete images.\\n\\n  .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n      idf.py flash monitor\\n\\n  .. note::\\n\\n      This command does not include any user files which should be written to the partitions on the flash memory. Please write them manually before running this command otherwise the files should be encrypted separately before writing.\\n\\n  This command will write to flash memory unencrypted images: the firmware bootloader, the partition table and applications. Once the flashing is complete, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} will reset. On the next boot, the firmware bootloader encrypts: the firmware bootloader, application partitions and partitions marked as ``encrypted`` then resets. Encrypting in-place can take time, up to a minute for large partitions. After that, the application is decrypted at runtime and executed.\\n\\nA sample output of the first {IDF_TARGET_NAME} boot after enabling flash encryption is given below:\\n\\n.. include:: {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}_log.inc\\n   :start-after: first_boot_enc\\n   :end-before: ------\\n\\nA sample output of subsequent {IDF_TARGET_NAME} boots just mentions that flash encryption is already enabled:\\n\\n.. include:: {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}_log.inc\\n   :start-after: already_en_enc\\n   :end-before: ------\\n\\nAt this stage, if you need to update and re-flash binaries, see :ref:`encrypt-partitions`.\\n\\n\\n.. _pregenerated-flash-encryption-key:\\n\\nUsing Host Generated Key\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nIt is possible to pre-generate a flash encryption key on the host computer and burn it into the eFuse. This allows you to pre-encrypt data on the host and flash already encrypted data without needing a plaintext flash update. This feature can be used in both :ref:`flash-enc-development-mode` and :ref:`flash-enc-release-mode`. Without a pre-generated key, data is flashed in plaintext and then {IDF_TARGET_NAME} encrypts the data in-place.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    This option is not recommended for production, unless a separate key is generated for each individual device.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c2\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n       Note that {IDF_TARGET_NAME} only has one eFuse key block for both Secure Boot and Flash Encryption keys. Therefore, writing the host-generated Flash Encryption key must be done with Secure Boot key (if used), otherwise Secure Boot cannot be used.\\n\\nTo use a host generated key, take the following steps:\\n\\n1. Ensure that you have an {IDF_TARGET_NAME} device with default flash encryption eFuse settings as shown in :ref:`flash-encryption-efuse`.\\n\\n  See how to check :ref:`flash-encryption-status`.\\n\\n2.

And ``KEYPURPOSE`` is either ``AES_256_KEY_1``, ``XTS_AES_256_KEY_2``, ``XTS_AES_128_KEY``. See `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}>`_ for a description of the key purposes.\\n\\n    For AES-128 (256-bit key) - ``XTS_AES_128_KEY``:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n        espefuse.py --port PORT burn_key BLOCK my_flash_encryption_key.bin XTS_AES_128_KEY\\n\\n    For AES-256 (512-bit key) - ``XTS_AES_256_KEY_1`` and ``XTS_AES_256_KEY_2``. ``espefuse.py`` supports burning both these two key purposes together with a 512 bit key to two separate key blocks via the virtual key purpose ``XTS_AES_256_KEY``. When this is used ``espefuse.py`` will burn the first 256 bit of the key to the specified ``BLOCK`` and burn the corresponding block key purpose to ``XTS_AES_256_KEY_1``. The last 256 bit of the key will be burned to the first free key block after ``BLOCK`` and the corresponding block key purpose to ``XTS_AES_256_KEY_2``\\n\\n    .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n        espefuse.py  --port PORT  burn_key BLOCK my_flash_encryption_key.bin XTS_AES_256_KEY\\n\\n    If you wish to specify exactly which two blocks are used then it is possible to divide key into two 256 bit keys, and manually burn each half with ``XTS_AES_256_KEY_1`` and ``XTS_AES_256_KEY_2`` as key purposes:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n      split -b 32 my_flash_encryption_key.bin my_flash_encryption_key.bin.\\n      espefuse.py  --port PORT  burn_key BLOCK my_flash_encryption_key.bin.aa XTS_AES_256_KEY_1\\n      espefuse.py  --port PORT  burn_key BLOCK+1 my_flash_encryption_key.bin.ab XTS_AES_256_KEY_2\\n\\n\\n  .. only:: SOC_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_XTS_AES_128 and not SOC_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_XTS_AES_256 and not SOC_EFUSE_CONSISTS_OF_ONE_KEY_BLOCK\\n\\n    .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n        espefuse.py --port PORT burn_key BLOCK my_flash_encryption_key.bin XTS_AES_128_KEY\\n\\n    where ``BLOCK`` is a free keyblock between ``BLOCK_KEY0`` and ``BLOCK_KEY5``.\\n\\n  .. only:: SOC_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_XTS_AES_128 and SOC_EFUSE_CONSISTS_OF_ONE_KEY_BLOCK\\n\\n    For AES-128 (256-bit key) - ``XTS_AES_128_KEY`` (the ``XTS_KEY_LENGTH_256`` eFuse will be burn to 1):\\n\\n    .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n        espefuse.py  --port PORT  burn_key BLOCK_KEY0 flash_encryption_key256.bin XTS_AES_128_KEY\\n\\n    For AES-128 key derived from 128 bits (SHA256(128 bits)) - ``XTS_AES_128_KEY_DERIVED_FROM_128_EFUSE_BITS``. The FE key will be written in the lower part of eFuse BLOCK_KEY0. The upper 128 bits are not used and will remain available for reading by software.

See :ref:`manual-encryption`.\\n\\n.. _flash-encrypt-best-practices:\\n\\nBest Practices\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen using Flash Encryption in production:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n   - Do not reuse the same flash encryption key between multiple devices. This means that an attacker who copies encrypted data from one device cannot transfer it to a second device.\\n   :esp32: - When using ESP32 V3, if the UART ROM Download Mode is not needed for a production device then it should be disabled to provide an extra level of protection. Do this by calling :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_disable_rom_download_mode` during application startup. Alternatively, configure the project :ref:`CONFIG_ESP32_REV_MIN` level to 3 (targeting ESP32 V3 only) and select the :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_UART_ROM_DL_MODE` to \"Permanently disable ROM Download Mode (recommended)\". The ability to disable ROM Download Mode is not available on earlier ESP32 versions.\\n   :not esp32: - The UART ROM Download Mode should be disabled entirely if it is not needed, or permanently set to \"Secure Download Mode\" otherwise. Secure Download Mode permanently limits the available commands to updating SPI config, changing baud rate, basic flash write, and returning a summary of the currently enabled security features with the `get_security_info` command. The default behaviour is to set Secure Download Mode on first boot in Release mode. To disable Download Mode entirely, select :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_UART_ROM_DL_MODE` to \"Permanently disable ROM Download Mode (recommended)\" or call :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_disable_rom_download_mode` at runtime.\\n   - Enable :doc:`Secure Boot <secure-boot-v2>` as an extra layer of protection, and to prevent an attacker from selectively corrupting any part of the flash before boot.\\n\\nEnable Flash Encryption Externally\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nIn the process mentioned above, flash encryption related eFuses which ultimately enable flash encryption are programmed through the firmware bootloader. Alternatively, all the eFuses can be programmed with the help of ``espefuse`` tool. Please refer :ref:`enable-flash-encryption-externally` for more details.\\n\\nPossible Failures\\n-----------------\\n\\nOnce flash encryption is enabled, the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` eFuse value will have an odd number of bits set. It means that all the partitions marked with the encryption flag are expected to contain encrypted ciphertext. Below are the three typical failure cases if the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is erroneously loaded with plaintext data:\\n\\n1. If the bootloader partition is re-flashed with a **plaintext firmware bootloader image**, the ROM bootloader will fail to load the firmware bootloader resulting in the following failure:\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n  .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n      rst:0x3 (SW_RESET),boot:0x13 (SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)\\n      flash read err, 1000\\n      ets_main.c 371\\n      ets Jun  8 2016 00:22:57\\n\\n      rst:0x7 (TG0WDT_SYS_RESET),boot:0x13 (SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)\\n      flash read err, 1000\\n      ets_main.c 371\\n      ets Jun  8 2016 00:22:57\\n\\n      rst:0x7 (TG0WDT_SYS_RESET),boot:0x13 (SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)\\n      flash read err, 1000\\n      ets_main.c 371\\n      ets Jun  8 2016 00:22:57\\n\\n      rst:0x7 (TG0WDT_SYS_RESET),boot:0x13 (SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)\\n      flash read err, 1000\\n      ets_main.c 371\\n      ets Jun  8 2016 00:22:57\\n\\n      rst:0x7 (TG0WDT_SYS_RESET),boot:0x13 (SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)\\n      flash read err, 1000\\n      ets_main.c 371\\n      ets Jun  8 2016 00:22:57\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n  .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n      rst:0x3 (SW_RESET),boot:0x13 (SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)\\n      invalid header: 0xb414f76b\\n      invalid header: 0xb414f76b\\n      invalid header: 0xb414f76b\\n      invalid header: 0xb414f76b\\n      invalid header: 0xb414f76b\\n      invalid header: 0xb414f76b\\n      invalid header: 0xb414f76b\\n\\n  .. note::\\n\\n    The value of invalid header will be different for every application.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    This error also appears if the flash contents are erased or corrupted.\\n\\n2.

Ensure that you have an {IDF_TARGET_NAME} device with default flash encryption eFuse settings as shown in :ref:`flash-encryption-efuse`.\\n\\nTo check if flash encryption on your {IDF_TARGET_NAME} device is enabled, do one of the following:\\n\\n- flash the application example :example:`security/flash_encryption` onto your device. This application prints the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` eFuse value and if flash encryption is enabled or disabled.\\n\\n- :doc:`Find the serial port name <../get-started/establish-serial-connection>` under which your {IDF_TARGET_NAME} device is connected, replace ``PORT`` with your port name in the following command, and run it:\\n\\n  .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n      espefuse.py -p PORT summary\\n\\n\\n.. _reading-writing-content:\\n\\nReading and Writing Data in Encrypted Flash\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} application code can check if flash encryption is currently enabled by calling :cpp:func:`esp_flash_encryption_enabled`. Also, a device can identify the flash encryption mode by calling :cpp:func:`esp_get_flash_encryption_mode`.\\n\\nOnce flash encryption is enabled, be more careful with accessing flash contents from code.\\n\\n\\nScope of Flash Encryption\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhenever the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` eFuse is set to a value with an odd number of bits, all flash content accessed via the MMU\\'s flash cache is transparently decrypted. It includes:\\n\\n- Executable application code in flash (IROM).\\n- All read-only data stored in flash (DROM).\\n- Any data accessed via :cpp:func:`spi_flash_mmap`.\\n- The firmware bootloader image when it is read by the ROM bootloader.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n    The MMU flash cache unconditionally decrypts all existing data. Data which is stored unencrypted in flash memory will also be \"transparently decrypted\" via the flash cache and will appear to software as random garbage.\\n\\n\\nReading from Encrypted Flash\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTo read data without using a flash cache MMU mapping, you can use the partition read function :cpp:func:`esp_partition_read`. This function will only decrypt data when it is read from an encrypted partition. Data read from unencrypted partitions will not be decrypted. In this way, software can access encrypted and non-encrypted flash in the same way.\\n\\nYou can also use the following SPI flash API functions:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_flash_read` to read raw (encrypted) data which will not be decrypted\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_flash_read_encrypted` to read and decrypt data\\n\\nData stored using the Non-Volatile Storage (NVS) API is always stored and read decrypted from the perspective of flash encryption. It is up to the library to provide encryption feature if required. Refer to :doc:`../api-reference/storage/nvs_encryption` for more details.\\n\\n\\nWriting to Encrypted Flash\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIt is recommended to use the partition write function :cpp:func:`esp_partition_write`. This function will only encrypt data when it is written to an encrypted partition. Data written to unencrypted partitions will not be encrypted. In this way, software can access encrypted and non-encrypted flash in the same way.\\n\\nYou can also pre-encrypt and write data using the function :cpp:func:`esp_flash_write_encrypted`\\n\\nAlso, the following ROM function exist but not supported in esp-idf applications:\\n\\n- ``esp_rom_spiflash_write_encrypted`` pre-encrypts and writes data to flash\\n- ``SPIWrite`` writes unencrypted data to flash\\n\\nSince data is encrypted in blocks, the minimum write size for encrypted data is 16 bytes and the alignment is also 16 bytes.\\n\\n\\n.. _updating-encrypted-flash:\\n\\nUpdating Encrypted Flash\\n------------------------\\n\\n.. _updating-encrypted-flash-ota:\\n\\nOTA Updates\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nOTA updates to encrypted partitions will automatically write encrypted data if the function :cpp:func:`esp_partition_write` is used.\\n\\nBefore building the application image for OTA updating of an already encrypted device, enable the option :ref:`Enable flash encryption on boot <CONFIG_SECURE_FLASH_ENC_ENABLED>` in project configuration menu.\\n\\nFor general information about ESP-IDF OTA updates, please refer to :doc:`OTA <../api-reference/system/ota>`\\n\\n\\n.. _updating-encrypted-flash-serial:\\n\\nUpdating Encrypted Flash via Serial\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFlashing an encrypted device via serial bootloader requires that the serial bootloader download interface has not been permanently disabled via eFuse.\\n\\nIn Development Mode, the recommended method is :ref:`encrypt-partitions`.\\n\\nIn Release Mode, if a copy of the same key stored in eFuse is available on the host then it is possible to pre-encrypt files on the host and then flash them. See :ref:`manual-encryption`.\\n\\nDisabling Flash Encryption\\n--------------------------\\n\\nIf flash encryption was enabled accidentally, flashing of plaintext data will soft-brick the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. The device will reboot continuously, printing the error ``flash read err, 1000`` or ``invalid header: 0xXXXXXX``.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n  For flash encryption in Development mode, encryption can be disabled by burning the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` eFuse. It can only be done three times per chip by taking the following steps:\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n  For flash encryption in Development mode, encryption can be disabled by burning the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` eFuse. It can only be done one time per chip by taking the following steps:\\n\\n#. In :ref:`project-configuration-menu`, disable :ref:`Enable flash encryption on boot <CONFIG_SECURE_FLASH_ENC_ENABLED>`, then save and exit.\\n#. Open project configuration menu again and **double-check** that you have disabled this option! If this option is left enabled, the bootloader will immediately re-enable encryption when it boots.\\n#. With flash encryption disabled, build and flash the new bootloader and application by running ``idf.py flash``.\\n#. Use ``espefuse.py`` (in ``components/esptool_py/esptool``) to disable the ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` by running:\\n\\n  .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n      espefuse.py burn_efuse {IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}\\n\\nReset the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. Flash encryption will be disabled, and the bootloader will boot as usual.\\n\\n\\nKey Points About Flash Encryption\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n  :esp32: - Flash memory contents is encrypted using AES-256. The flash encryption key is stored in the ``flash_encryption`` eFuse internal to the chip and, by default, is protected from software access.\\n\\n  :esp32: - The flash encryption algorithm is AES-256, where the key is \"tweaked\" with the offset address of each 32 byte block of flash. This means that every 32-byte block (two consecutive 16 byte AES blocks) is encrypted with a unique key derived from the flash encryption key.\\n\\n  :SOC_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_XTS_AES_256: - Flash memory contents is encrypted using XTS-AES-128 or XTS-AES-256. The flash encryption key is 256 bits and 512 bits respectively and stored in one or two ``BLOCK_KEYN`` eFuses internal to the chip and, by default, is protected from software access.\\n\\n  :SOC_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_XTS_AES_128 and not SOC_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_XTS_AES_256 and not SOC_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_XTS_AES_128_DERIVED: - Flash memory contents is encrypted using XTS-AES-128. The flash encryption key is 256 bits and stored in one ``BLOCK_KEYN`` eFuse internal to the chip and, by default, is protected from software access.\\n\\n  :SOC_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_XTS_AES_128_DERIVED: - Flash memory contents is encrypted using XTS-AES-128. The flash encryption key is 256 or 128 bits and stored in ``BLOCK_KEY0`` eFuse internal to the chip and, by default, is protected from software access.\\n\\n  - Flash access is transparent via the flash cache mapping feature of {IDF_TARGET_NAME} - any flash regions which are mapped to the address space will be transparently decrypted when read.\\n\\n    Some data partitions might need to remain unencrypted for ease of access or might require the use of flash-friendly update algorithms which are ineffective if the data is encrypted. NVS partitions for non-volatile storage cannot be encrypted since the NVS library is not directly compatible with flash encryption. For details, refer to :doc:`NVS Encryption <../api-reference/storage/nvs_encryption>`.\\n\\n  - If flash encryption might be used in future, the programmer must keep it in mind and take certain precautions when writing code that :ref:`uses encrypted flash <reading-writing-content>`.\\n\\n  - If secure boot is enabled, re-flashing the bootloader of an encrypted device requires a \"Re-flashable\" secure boot digest (see :ref:`flash-encryption-and-secure-boot`).\\n\\nEnabling flash encryption will increase the size of bootloader, which might require updating partition table offset. See :ref:`bootloader-size`.\\n\\n    .. important::\\n\\n        Do not interrupt power to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} while the first boot encryption pass is running. If power is interrupted, the flash contents will be corrupted and will require flashing with unencrypted data again. In this case, re-flashing will not count towards the flashing limit.\\n\\n\\n.. _flash-encryption-limitations:\\n\\nLimitations of Flash Encryption\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nFlash encryption protects firmware against unauthorised readout and modification. It is important to understand the limitations of the flash encryption feature:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - Flash encryption is only as strong as the key. For this reason, we recommend keys are generated on the device during first boot (default behaviour). If generating keys off-device, ensure proper procedure is followed and do not share the same key between all production devices.\\n    - Not all data is stored encrypted. If storing data on flash, check if the method you are using (library, API, etc.) supports flash encryption.\\n    - Flash encryption does not prevent an attacker from understanding the high-level layout of the flash. This is because the same AES key is used for every pair of adjacent 16 byte AES blocks. When these adjacent 16 byte blocks contain identical content (such as empty or padding areas), these blocks will encrypt to produce matching pairs of encrypted blocks. This may allow an attacker to make high-level comparisons between encrypted devices (i.e., to tell if two devices are probably running the same firmware version).\\n    :esp32: - For the same reason, an attacker can always tell when a pair of adjacent 16 byte blocks (32 byte aligned) contain two identical 16 byte sequences. Keep this in mind if storing sensitive data on the flash, design your flash storage so this does not happen (using a counter byte or some other non-identical value every 16 bytes is sufficient). :doc:`NVS Encryption <../api-reference/storage/nvs_encryption>` deals with this and is suitable for many uses.\\n    - Flash encryption alone may not prevent an attacker from modifying the firmware of the device. To prevent unauthorised firmware from running on the device, use flash encryption in combination with :doc:`Secure Boot <secure-boot-v2>`.\\n\\n.. _flash-encryption-and-secure-boot:\\n\\nFlash Encryption and Secure Boot\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nIt is recommended to use flash encryption in combination with Secure Boot. However, if Secure Boot is enabled, additional restrictions apply to device re-flashing:\\n\\n- :ref:`updating-encrypted-flash-ota` are not restricted, provided that the new app is signed correctly with the Secure Boot signing key.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    - :ref:`Plaintext serial flash updates <updating-encrypted-flash-serial>` are only possible if the :ref:`Re-flashable <CONFIG_SECURE_BOOTLOADER_MODE>` Secure Boot mode is selected and a Secure Boot key was pre-generated and burned to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} (refer to :ref:`Secure Boot <secure-boot-reflashable>`). In such configuration, ``idf.py bootloader`` will produce a pre-digested bootloader and secure boot digest file for flashing at offset 0x0. When following the plaintext serial re-flashing steps it is necessary to re-flash this file before flashing other plaintext data.\\n\\n    - :ref:`Re-flashing via Pregenerated Flash Encryption Key <pregenerated-flash-encryption-key>` is still possible, provided the bootloader is not re-flashed. Re-flashing the bootloader requires the same :ref:`Re-flashable <CONFIG_SECURE_BOOTLOADER_MODE>` option to be enabled in the Secure Boot config.\\n\\n.. _flash-encryption-advanced-features:\\n\\nAdvanced Features\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe following section covers advanced features of flash encryption.\\n\\n.. _encrypted-partition-flag:\\n\\nEncrypted Partition Flag\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSome partitions are encrypted by default. Other partitions can be marked in the partition table description as requiring encryption by adding the flag ``encrypted`` to the partitions\\' flag field. As a result, data in these marked partitions will be treated as encrypted in the same manner as an app partition.\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n   # Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,  Size, Flags\\n   nvs,      data, nvs,     0x9000,  0x6000\\n   phy_init, data, phy,     0xf000,  0x1000\\n   factory,  app,  factory, 0x10000, 1M\\n   secret_data, 0x40, 0x01, 0x20000, 256K, encrypted\\n\\nFor details on partition table description, see :doc:`partition table <../api-guides/partition-tables>`.\\n\\nFurther information about encryption of partitions:\\n\\n- Default partition tables do not include any encrypted data partitions.\\n- With flash encryption enabled, the ``app`` partition is always treated as encrypted and does not require marking.\\n- If flash encryption is not enabled, the flag \"encrypted\" has no effect.\\n- You can also consider protecting ``phy_init`` data from physical access, readout, or modification, by marking the optional ``phy`` partition with the flag ``encrypted``.\\n- The ``nvs`` partition cannot be encrypted, because the NVS library is not directly compatible with flash encryption.\\n\\n\\n.. _uart-bootloader-encryption:\\n\\nEnabling UART Bootloader Encryption/Decryption\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nOn the first boot, the flash encryption process burns by default the following eFuses:\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n  - ``DISABLE_DL_ENCRYPT`` which disables flash encryption operation when running in UART bootloader boot mode.\\n  - ``DISABLE_DL_DECRYPT`` which disables transparent flash decryption when running in UART bootloader mode, even if the eFuse ``{IDF_TARGET_CRYPT_CNT}`` is set to enable it in normal operation.\\n  - ``DISABLE_DL_CACHE`` which disables the entire MMU flash cache when running in UART bootloader mode.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n  .. list::\\n\\n    - ``DIS_DOWNLOAD_MANUAL_ENCRYPT`` which disables flash encryption operation when running in UART bootloader boot mode.\\n    :SOC_EFUSE_DIS_DOWNLOAD_ICACHE and SOC_EFUSE_DIS_DOWNLOAD_DCACHE: - ``DIS_DOWNLOAD_ICACHE`` and ``DIS_DOWNLOAD_DCACHE`` which disables the entire MMU flash cache when running in UART bootloader mode.\\n    :SOC_EFUSE_DIS_DOWNLOAD_ICACHE and not SOC_EFUSE_DIS_DOWNLOAD_DCACHE: - ``DIS_DOWNLOAD_ICACHE`` which disables the entire MMU flash cache when running in UART bootloader mode.\\n    :esp32s2: - ``HARD_DIS_JTAG`` which disables JTAG.\\n    :SOC_EFUSE_DIS_PAD_JTAG and SOC_EFUSE_DIS_USB_JTAG: - ``DIS_PAD_JTAG`` and ``DIS_USB_JTAG`` which disables JTAG.\\n    :SOC_EFUSE_HARD_DIS_JTAG and SOC_EFUSE_DIS_USB_JTAG: - ``HARD_DIS_JTAG`` and ``DIS_USB_JTAG`` which disables JTAG.\\n    - ``DIS_DIRECT_BOOT`` (old name ``DIS_LEGACY_SPI_BOOT``)  which disables direct boot mode\\n    :SOC_EFUSE_DIS_DOWNLOAD_MSPI: - ``DIS_DOWNLOAD_MSPI`` which disables the MSPI access in download mode.\\n\\nHowever, before the first boot you can choose to keep any of these features enabled by burning only selected eFuses and write-protect the rest of eFuses with unset value 0. For example:\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n  .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    espefuse.py --port PORT burn_efuse DISABLE_DL_DECRYPT\\n    espefuse.py --port PORT write_protect_efuse DISABLE_DL_ENCRYPT\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n  .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    espefuse.py --port PORT burn_efuse DIS_DOWNLOAD_MANUAL_ENCRYPT\\n    espefuse.py --port PORT write_protect_efuse DIS_DOWNLOAD_MANUAL_ENCRYPT\\n\\n  .. note::\\n\\n      Set all appropriate bits before write-protecting!\\n\\n      Write protection of all the three eFuses is controlled by one bit. It means that write-protecting one eFuse bit will inevitably write-protect all unset eFuse bits.\\n\\n  Write protecting these eFuses to keep them unset is not currently very useful, as ``esptool.py`` does not support reading encrypted flash.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n  .. important::\\n\\n      Leaving ``DISABLE_DL_DECRYPT`` unset (0) makes flash encryption useless.\\n\\n      An attacker with physical access to the chip can use UART bootloader mode with custom stub code to read out the flash contents.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n  .. _setting-flash-crypt-config:\\n\\n  Setting FLASH_CRYPT_CONFIG\\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n  The eFuse ``FLASH_CRYPT_CONFIG`` determines the number of bits in the flash encryption key which are \"tweaked\" with the block offset. For details, see :ref:`flash-encryption-algorithm`.\\n\\n  On the first boot of the firmware bootloader, this value is set to the maximum ``0xF``.\\n\\n  It is possible to burn this eFuse manually and write protect it before the first boot in order to select different tweak values. However, this is not recommended.\\n\\n  It is strongly recommended to never write-protect ``FLASH_CRYPT_CONFIG`` when it is unset. Otherwise, its value will remain zero permanently, and no bits in the flash encryption key will be tweaked. As a result, the flash encryption algorithm will be equivalent to AES ECB mode.\\n\\nJTAG Debugging\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy default, when Flash Encryption is enabled (in either Development or Release mode) then JTAG debugging is disabled via eFuse. The bootloader does this on first boot, at the same time it enables flash encryption.\\n\\nSee :ref:`jtag-debugging-security-features` for more information about using JTAG Debugging with Flash Encryption.\\n\\n\\n.. _manual-encryption:\\n\\nManually Encrypting Files\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nManually encrypting or decrypting files requires the flash encryption key to be pre-burned in eFuse (see :ref:`pregenerated-flash-encryption-key`) and a copy to be kept on the host. If the flash encryption is configured in Development Mode then it is not necessary to keep a copy of the key or follow these steps, the simpler :ref:`encrypt-partitions` steps can be used.\\n\\nThe key file should be a single raw binary file (example: ``key.bin``).\\n\\nFor example, these are the steps to encrypt the file ``build/my-app.bin`` to flash at offset 0x10000. Run espsecure.py as follows:\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n       espsecure.py encrypt_flash_data --keyfile /path/to/key.bin --address 0x10000 --output my-app-ciphertext.bin build/my-app.bin\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n    .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n       espsecure.py encrypt_flash_data --aes_xts --keyfile /path/to/key.bin --address 0x10000 --output my-app-ciphertext.bin build/my-app.bin\\n\\nThe file ``my-app-ciphertext.bin`` can then be flashed to offset 0x10000 using ``esptool.py``. To see all of the command line options recommended for ``esptool.py``, see the output printed when ``idf.py build`` succeeds.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   If the flashed ciphertext file is not recognized by the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} when it boots, check that the keys match and that the command line arguments match exactly, including the correct offset.\\n\\n   .. only:: esp32\\n\\n       If your ESP32 uses non-default :ref:`FLASH_CRYPT_CONFIG value in eFuse <setting-flash-crypt-config>` then you will need to pass the ``--flash_crypt_conf`` argument to ``espsecure.py`` to set the matching value. This will not happen if the device configured flash encryption by itself, but may happen if burning eFuses manually to enable flash encryption.\\n\\nThe command ``espsecure.py decrypt_flash_data`` can be used with the same options (and different input/output files), to decrypt ciphertext flash contents or a previously encrypted file.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPIRAM_SUPPORTED and not esp32\\n\\n  External RAM\\n  ------------\\n\\n  When Flash Encryption is enabled any data read from and written to external SPI RAM through the cache will also be encrypted/decrypted. This happens the same way and with the same key as for Flash Encryption. If Flash Encryption is enabled then encryption for external SPI RAM is also always enabled, it is not possible to separately control this functionality.\\n\\n\\nTechnical Details\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe following sections provide some reference information about the operation of flash encryption.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_XTS_AES\\n\\n  .. _flash-encryption-algorithm:\\n\\n  Flash Encryption Algorithm\\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n  - AES-256 operates on 16-byte blocks of data. The flash encryption engine encrypts and decrypts data in 32-byte blocks - two AES blocks in series.\\n\\n  - The main flash encryption key is stored in the ``flash_encryption`` eFuse and, by default, is protected from further writes or software readout.\\n\\n  - AES-256 key size is 256 bits (32 bytes) read from the ``flash_encryption`` eFuse. The hardware AES engine uses the key in reversed byte order as compared to the storage order in ``flash_encryption``.\\n\\n    - If the ``CODING_SCHEME`` eFuse is set to ``0`` (default, \"None\" Coding Scheme) then the eFuse key block is 256 bits and the key is stored as-is (in reversed byte order).\\n    - If the ``CODING_SCHEME`` eFuse is set to ``1`` (3/4 Encoding) then the eFuse key block is 192 bits (in reversed byte order), so overall entropy is reduced. The hardware flash encryption still operates on a 256-bit key, after being read (and un-reversed), the key is extended as ``key = key[0:255] + key[64:127]``.\\n\\n  - AES algorithm is used inverted in flash encryption, so the flash encryption \"encrypt\" operation is AES decrypt and the \"decrypt\" operation is AES encrypt. This is for performance reasons and does not alter the effeciency of the algorithm.\\n\\n  - Each 32-byte block (two adjacent 16-byte AES blocks) is encrypted with a unique key. The key is derived from the main flash encryption key in ``flash_encryption``, XORed with the offset of this block in the flash (a \"key tweak\").\\n\\n  - The specific tweak depends on the ``FLASH_CRYPT_CONFIG`` eFuse setting. This is a 4-bit eFuse where each bit enables XORing of a particular range of the key bits:\\n\\n    - Bit 1, bits 0-66 of the key are XORed.\\n    - Bit 2, bits 67-131 of the key are XORed.\\n    - Bit 3, bits 132-194 of the key are XORed.\\n    - Bit 4, bits 195-256 of the key are XORed.\\n\\n    It is recommended that ``FLASH_CRYPT_CONFIG`` is always left at the default value ``0xF``, so that all key bits are XORed with the block offset. For details, see :ref:`setting-flash-crypt-config`.\\n\\n  - The high 19 bits of the block offset (bit 5 to bit 23) are XORed with the main flash encryption key. This range is chosen for two reasons: the maximum flash size is 16MB (24 bits), and each block is 32 bytes so the least significant 5 bits are always zero.\\n\\n  - There is a particular mapping from each of the 19 block offset bits to the 256 bits of the flash encryption key to determine which bit is XORed with which. See the variable ``_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_TWEAK_PATTERN`` in the ``espsecure.py`` source code for complete mapping.\\n\\n  - To see the full flash encryption algorithm implemented in Python, refer to the ``_flash_encryption_operation()`` function in the ``espsecure.py`` source code.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_FLASH_ENCRYPTION_XTS_AES_256\\n\\n  .. _flash-encryption-algorithm:\\n\\n  Flash Encryption Algorithm\\n  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n  - {IDF_TARGET_NAME} use the XTS-AES block cipher mode with 256 bit or 512 bit key size for flash encryption.\\n\\n  - XTS-AES is a block cipher mode specifically designed for disc encryption and addresses the weaknesses other potential modes (e.g., AES-CTR) have for this use case.

It is highly recommended to consider this guide while designing the products with the Espressif platform and the ESP-IDF software stack from the **security** perspective.\\n\\nGoals\\n-----\\n\\nHigh level security goals are as follows:\\n\\n#. Preventing untrustworthy code from being executed\\n#. Protecting the identity and integrity of the code stored in the off-chip flash memory\\n#. Securing device identity\\n#. Secure storage for confidential data\\n#. Authenticated and encrypted communication from the device\\n\\nPlatform Security\\n-----------------\\n\\n.. _secure_boot-guide:\\n\\nSecure Boot\\n~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe Secure Boot feature ensures that only authenticated software can execute on the device. The Secure Boot process forms a chain of trust by verifying all **mutable** software entities involved in the :doc:`../api-guides/startup`. Signature verification happens during both boot-up as well as in OTA updates.\\n\\nPlease refer to :doc:`secure-boot-v2` for detailed documentation about this feature.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    For ESP32 before ECO3, please refer to :doc:`secure-boot-v1`.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n    It is highly recommended that Secure Boot be enabled on all production devices.\\n\\nSecure Boot Best Practices\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n* Generate the signing key on a system with a quality source of entropy.\\n* Always keep the signing key private. A leak of this key will compromise the Secure Boot system.\\n* Do not allow any third party to observe any aspects of the key generation or signing process using ``espsecure.py``. Both processes are vulnerable to timing or other side-channel attacks.\\n* Ensure that all security eFuses have been correctly programmed, including disabling of the debug interfaces, non-required boot mediums (e.g., UART DL mode), etc.\\n\\n\\n.. _flash_enc-guide:\\n\\nFlash Encryption\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe Flash Encryption feature helps to encrypt the contents on the off-chip flash memory and thus provides the **confidentiality** aspect to the software or data stored in the flash memory.\\n\\nPlease refer to :doc:`flash-encryption` for detailed information about this feature.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPIRAM_SUPPORTED and not esp32\\n\\n    If {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is connected to an external SPI RAM, the contents written to or read from the SPI RAM will also be encrypted and decrypted respectively (via the MMU\\'s flash cache, provided that FLash Encryption is enabled). This provides an additional safety layer for the data stored in SPI RAM, hence configurations like ``CONFIG_MBEDTLS_EXTERNAL_MEM_ALLOC`` can be safely enabled in this case.\\n\\nFlash Encryption Best Practices\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n* It is recommended to use flash Encryption release mode for the production use-cases.\\n* It is recommended to have a unique flash encryption key per device.\\n* Enable :ref:`secure_boot-guide` as an extra layer of protection, and to prevent an attacker from selectively corrupting any part of the flash before boot.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_DIG_SIGN_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Device Identity\\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n    The Digital Signature peripheral in {IDF_TARGET_NAME} produces hardware-accelerated RSA digital signatures with the assistance of HMAC, without the RSA private key being accessible by software. This allows the private key to be kept secured on the device without anyone other than the device hardware being able to access it.\\n\\n    .. only:: SOC_ECDSA_SUPPORTED\\n\\n        {IDF_TARGET_NAME} also supportes ECDSA peripheral for generating hardware-accelerated ECDSA digital signatures. ECDSA private key can be directly programmed in an eFuse block and marked as read protected from the software.\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_SIG_PERI} peripheral can help to establish the **Secure Device Identity** to the remote endpoint, e.g., in the case of TLS mutual authentication based on the {IDF_TARGET_CIPHER_SCHEME} cipher scheme.\\n\\n    .. only:: not SOC_ECDSA_SUPPORTED\\n\\n        Please refer to the :doc:`../api-reference/peripherals/ds` for detailed documentation.\\n\\n    .. only:: SOC_ECDSA_SUPPORTED\\n\\n        Please refer to the :doc:`../api-reference/peripherals/ecdsa` and :doc:`../api-reference/peripherals/ds` guides for detailed documentation.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_MEMPROT_SUPPORTED or SOC_CPU_IDRAM_SPLIT_USING_PMP\\n\\n    Memory Protection\\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports the **Memory Protection** scheme, either through architecture or special peripheral like PMS, which provides an ability to enforce and monitor permission attributes to memory and, in some cases, peripherals. ESP-IDF application startup code configures the permissions attributes like Read/Write access on data memories and Read/Execute access on instruction memories using the relevant peripheral. If there is any attempt made that breaks these permission attributes, e.g., a write operation to instruction memory region, then a violation interrupt is raised, and it results in system panic.\\n\\n    This feature depends on the config option :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_MEMPROT_FEATURE` and it is kept enabled by default. Please note that the API for this feature is **private** and used exclusively by ESP-IDF code only.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        This feature can help to prevent the possibility of remote code injection due to the existing vulnerabilities in the software.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_CRYPTO_DPA_PROTECTION_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    DPA (Differential Power Analysis) Protection\\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has support for protection mechanisms against the Differential Power Analysis related security attacks. DPA protection dynamically adjusts the clock frequency of the crypto peripherals, thereby blurring the power consumption trajectory during its operation. Based on the configured DPA security level, the clock variation range changes. Please refer to the TRM for more details on this topic.\\n\\n    :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_CRYPTO_DPA_PROTECTION_LEVEL` can help to select the DPA level. Higher level means better security, but it can also have an associated performance impact. By default, the lowest DPA level is kept enabled but it can be modified based on the security requirement.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Please note that hardware :doc:`RNG <../api-reference/system/random>` must be enabled for DPA protection to work correctly.\\n\\nDebug Interfaces\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nJTAG\\n^^^^\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - JTAG interface stays disabled if any of the security features are enabled. Please refer to :ref:`jtag-debugging-security-features` for more information.\\n    - JTAG interface can also be disabled in the absence of any other security features using :ref:`efuse_API`.\\n    :SOC_HMAC_SUPPORTED: - {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports soft disabling the JTAG interface and it can be re-enabled by programming a secret key through HMAC. (:ref:`hmac_for_enabling_jtag`)\\n\\nUART Download Mode\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    For ESP32 ECO3 case, UART Download mode stays disabled if any of the security features are enabled in their release configuration. Alternatively, it can also be disabled by calling :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_disable_rom_download_mode` at runtime.\\n\\n    .. important::\\n\\n        If UART Download mode is disabled then ``esptool.py`` can not work on the device.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SUPPORTS_SECURE_DL_MODE\\n\\n    In {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, Secure UART Download mode gets activated if any of the security features are enabled.\\n\\n    * Secure UART Download mode can also be enabled by calling :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_enable_rom_secure_download_mode`.\\n    * This mode does not allow any arbitrary code to execute if downloaded through the UART download mode.\\n    * It also limits the available commands in Download mode to update SPI config, e.g., changing baud rate, basic flash write, and the command to return a summary of currently enabled security features (``get_security_info``).\\n    * To disable Download Mode entirely, select the :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_UART_ROM_DL_MODE` to the recommended option ``Permanently disable ROM Download Mode`` or call :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_disable_rom_download_mode` at runtime.\\n\\n    .. important::\\n\\n        In Secure UART Download mode, ``esptool.py`` can only work with the argument ``--no-stub``.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Network Security\\n    ----------------\\n\\n    Wi-Fi\\n    ~~~~~\\n\\n    In addition to the traditional security methods (WEP/WPA-TKIP/WPA2-CCMP), Wi-Fi driver in ESP-IDF also supports additional state-of-the-art security protocols. Please refer to the :doc:`../api-guides/wifi-security` for detailed documentation.\\n\\n    TLS (Transport Layer Security)\\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n    It is recommended to use TLS (Transport Layer Security) in all external communications (e.g., cloud communication, OTA updates) from the ESP device. ESP-IDF supports :doc:`../api-reference/protocols/mbedtls` as the official TLS stack.\\n\\n    TLS is default integrated in :doc:`../api-reference/protocols/esp_http_client`, :doc:`../api-reference/protocols/esp_https_server` and several other components that ship with ESP-IDF.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        It is recommended to use the ESP-IDF protocol components in their default configuration, which has been ensured to be secure. Disabling of HTTPS and similar security-critical configurations should be avoided.\\n\\n    ESP-TLS Abstraction\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    ESP-IDF provides an abstraction layer for the most-used TLS functionalities. Hence, it is recommended that an application uses the API exposed by :doc:`../api-reference/protocols/esp_tls`.\\n\\n    :ref:`esp_tls_server_verification` section highlights diverse ways in which the identity of server could be established on the device side.\\n\\n    ESP Certificate Bundle\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The :doc:`../api-reference/protocols/esp_crt_bundle` API provides an easy way to include a bundle of custom x509 root certificates for TLS server verification. The certificate bundle is the easiest way to verify the identity of almost all standard TLS servers.\\n\\n    .. important::\\n\\n        It is highly recommended to verify the identity of the server based on X.509 certificates to avoid establishing communication with the **fake** server.\\n\\n\\n    Managing Root Certificates\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Root Certificates embedded inside the application must be managed carefully. Any update to the root certificate list or the :doc:`../api-reference/protocols/esp_crt_bundle` can have an impact on the TLS connection with the remote endpoint. This includes a connection to the OTA update server. In some cases, the problem shall be visible on the next OTA update and it may leave device unable to perform OTA updates forever.\\n\\n    Root certificates list update could have following reasons:\\n\\n    - New firmware has different set of remote endpoint(s).\\n    - The existing certificate has expired.\\n    - The certificate has been added or retracted from the upstream certificate bundle.\\n    - The certificate list changed due to market share statistics (``CONFIG_MBEDTLS_CERTIFICATE_BUNDLE_DEFAULT_CMN`` case).\\n\\n    Some guidelines to consider on this topic:\\n\\n    - Please consider enabling :ref:`OTA rollback <ota_rollback>` and then keep the successful connection to the OTA update server as the checkpoint to cancel the rollback process. This ensures that the newly updated firmware can successfully reach till the OTA update server, otherwise rollback process will go back to the previous firmware on the device.\\n    - If you plan to enable the :ref:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_HAVE_TIME_DATE` option, then please consider to have the time sync mechanism (SNTP) and sufficient number of trusted certificates in place.\\n\\nProduct Security\\n----------------\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Secure Provisioning\\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n    Secure Provisioning refers to a process of secure on-boarding of the ESP device on to the Wi-Fi network. This mechanism also allows provision of additional custom configuration data during the initial provisioning phase from the provisioning entity, e.g., Smartphone.\\n\\n    ESP-IDF provides various security schemes to establish a secure session between ESP and the provisioning entity, they are highlighted at :ref:`provisioning_security_schemes`.\\n\\n    Please refer to the :doc:`../api-reference/provisioning/wifi_provisioning` documentation for details and the example code for this feature.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Espressif provides Android and iOS Phone Apps along with their sources, so that it could be easy to further customize them as per the product requirement.\\n\\nSecure OTA (Over-the-air) Updates\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n- OTA Updates must happen over secure transport, e.g., HTTPS.\\n- ESP-IDF provides a simplified abstraction layer :doc:`../api-reference/system/esp_https_ota` for this.\\n- If :ref:`secure_boot-guide` is enabled, then the server should host the signed application image.\\n- If :ref:`flash_enc-guide` is enabled, then no additional steps are required on the server side, encryption shall be taken care on the device itself during flash write.\\n- OTA update :ref:`ota_rollback` can help to switch the application as ``active`` only after its functionality has been verified.\\n\\n\\nAnti-Rollback Protection\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAnti-rollback protection feature ensures that device only executes the application that meets the security version criteria as stored in its eFuse. So even though the application is trusted and signed by legitimate key, it may contain some revoked security feature or credential. Hence, device must reject any such application.\\n\\nESP-IDF allows this feature for the application only and it is managed through 2nd stage bootloader. The security version is stored in the device eFuse and it is compared against the application image header during both bootup and over-the-air updates.\\n\\nPlease see more information to enable this feature in the :ref:`anti-rollback` guide.\\n\\nEncrypted Firmware Distribution\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nEncrypted firmware distribution during over-the-air updates ensures that the application stays encrypted **in transit** from the server to the the device. This can act as an additional layer of protection on top of the TLS communication during OTA updates and protect the identity of the application.\\n\\nPlease see working example for this documented in :ref:`ota_updates_pre-encrypted-firmware` section.\\n\\nSecure Storage\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nSecure storage refers to the application-specific data that can be stored in a secure manner on the device, i.e., off-chip flash memory. This is typically a read-write flash partition and holds device specific configuration data, e.g., Wi-Fi credentials.\\n\\nESP-IDF provides the **NVS (Non-volatile Storage)** management component which allows encrypted data partitions. This feature is tied with the platform :ref:`flash_enc-guide` feature described earlier.\\n\\nPlease refer to the :ref:`nvs_encryption` for detailed documentation on the working and instructions to enable this feature.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n    By default, ESP-IDF components writes the device specific data into the default NVS partition, including Wi-Fi credentials too, and it is recommended to protect this data using **NVS Encryption** feature.\\n\\nSecure Device Control\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nESP-IDF provides capability to control an ESP device over ``Wi-Fi + HTTP`` or ``BLE`` in a secure manner using ESP Local Control component.\\n\\nPlease refer to the :doc:`../api-reference/protocols/esp_local_ctrl` for detailed documentation about this feature.\\n\\nSecurity Policy\\n---------------\\n\\nThe ESP-IDF GitHub repository has attached `Security Policy Brief`_.\\n\\nAdvisories\\n~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n- Espressif publishes critical `Security Advisories`_, which includes security advisories regarding both hardware and software.\\n- The specific advisories of the ESP-IDF software components are published through the `GitHub repository`_.\\n\\nSoftware Updates\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nCritical security issues in the ESP-IDF components, and third-party libraries are fixed as and when we find them or when they are reported to us. Gradually, we make the fixes available in all applicable release branches in ESP-IDF.\\n\\nApplicable security issues and CVEs for the ESP-IDF components, third-party libraries are mentioned in the ESP-IDF release notes.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n    We recommend periodically updating to the latest bugfix version of the ESP-IDF release to have all critical security fixes available.\\n\\n\\n.. _`Security Policy Brief`: https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/SECURITY.md\\n.. _`Security Advisories`: https://www.espressif.com/en/support/documents/advisories\\n.. _`GitHub repository`: https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/security/advisories\\n',\n",

       " 'Project Configuration\\n*********************\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nIntroduction\\n============\\n\\nThe esp-idf-kconfig_ package that ESP-IDF uses is based on kconfiglib_, which is a Python extension to the Kconfig_ system. Kconfig provides a compile-time project configuration mechanism and offers configuration options of several types (e.g., integers, strings, and boolens). Kconfig files specify dependencies between options, default values of options, the way options are grouped together, etc.\\n\\nFor the full list of available features, please see Kconfig_ and `kconfiglib extentions`_.\\n\\n.. _project-configuration-menu:\\n\\nProject Configuration Menu\\n==========================\\n\\nApplication developers can open a terminal-based project configuration menu with the ``idf.py menuconfig`` build target.\\n\\nAfter being updated, this configuration is saved in the ``sdkconfig`` file under the project root directory. Based on ``sdkconfig``, application build targets will generate the ``sdkconfig.h`` file under the build directory, and will make the ``sdkconfig`` options available to the project build system and source files.\\n\\nUsing ``sdkconfig.defaults``\\n============================\\n\\nIn some cases, for example, when the ``sdkconfig`` file is under revision control, it may be inconvenient for the build system to change the ``sdkconfig`` file. The build system offers a solution to prevent it from happening, which is to create the ``sdkconfig.defaults`` file. This file is never touched by the build system, and can be created manually or automatically. It contains all the options which matter to the given application and are different from the default ones. The format is the same as that of the ``sdkconfig`` file. ``sdkconfig.defaults`` can be created manually when one remembers all the changed configuration, or it can be generated automatically by running the ``idf.py save-defconfig`` command.\\n\\nOnce ``sdkconfig.defaults`` is created, ``sdkconfig`` can be deleted or added to the ignore list of the revision control system (e.g., the ``.gitignore`` file for ``git``). Project build targets will automatically create the ``sdkconfig`` file, populate it with the settings from the ``sdkconfig.defaults`` file, and configure the rest of the settings to their default values. Note that during the build process, settings from ``sdkconfig.defaults`` will not override those already in ``sdkconfig``. For more information, see :ref:`custom-sdkconfig-defaults`.\\n\\nKconfig Format Rules\\n====================\\n\\nFormat rules for Kconfig files are as follows:\\n\\n- Option names in any menus should have consistent prefixes. The prefix currently should have at least 3 characters.\\n- The unit of indentation should be 4 spaces. All sub-items belonging to a parent item are indented by one level deeper. For example, ``menu`` is indented by 0 spaces, ``config``  ``menu`` by 4 spaces, ``help`` in ``config`` by 8 spaces, and the text under ``help`` by 12 spaces.\\n- No trailing spaces are allowed at the end of the lines.\\n- The maximum length of options is 50 characters.\\n- The maximum length of lines is 120 characters.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The ``help`` section of each config in the menu is treated as reStructuredText to generate the reference documentation for each option.\\n\\nFormat Checker\\n--------------\\n\\n``kconfcheck`` tool in esp-idf-kconfig_ package is provided for checking Kconfig files against the above format rules. The checker checks all Kconfig and ``Kconfig.projbuild`` files given as arguments, and generates a new file with suffix ``.new`` with some suggestions about how to fix issues (if there are any). Please note that the checker cannot correct all format issues and the responsibility of the developer is to final check and make corrections in order to pass the tests. For example, indentations will be corrected if there is not any misleading formatting, but it cannot come up with a common prefix for options inside a menu.\\n\\nThe ``esp-idf-kconfig`` package is available in ESP-IDF environments, where the checker tool can be invoked by running command ``python -m kconfcheck <path_to_kconfig_file>``.\\n\\nFor more information, please refer to `esp-idf-kconfig package documentation <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf-kconfig/blob/master/docs/DOCUMENTATION.md>`__.\\n\\n.. _configuration-options-compatibility:\\n\\nBackward Compatibility of Kconfig Options\\n=========================================\\n\\nThe standard Kconfig_ tools ignore unknown options in ``sdkconfig``. So if a developer has custom settings for options which are renamed in newer ESP-IDF releases, then the given setting for the option would be silently ignored. Therefore, several features have been adopted to avoid this:\\n\\n1. ``kconfgen`` is used by the tool chain to pre-process ``sdkconfig`` files before anything else. For example, ``menuconfig`` would read them, so the settings for old options is kept and not ignored.\\n2. ``kconfgen`` recursively finds all ``sdkconfig.rename`` files in ESP-IDF directory which contain old and new ``Kconfig`` option names. Old options are replaced by new ones in the ``sdkconfig`` file. Renames that should only appear for a single target can be placed in a target-specific rename file ``sdkconfig.rename.TARGET``, where ``TARGET`` is the target name, e.g., ``sdkconfig.rename.esp32s2``.\\n3. ``kconfgen`` post-processes ``sdkconfig`` files and generates all build outputs (``sdkconfig.h``, ``sdkconfig.cmake``, and ``auto.conf``) by adding a list of compatibility statements, i.e., the values of old options are set for new options after modification. If users still use old options in their code, this will prevent it from breaking.\\n4. :ref:`configuration-deprecated-options` are automatically generated by ``kconfgen``.\\n\\n.. _configuration-options-reference:\\n\\nConfiguration Options Reference\\n===============================\\n\\nSubsequent sections contain the list of available ESP-IDF options automatically generated from Kconfig files. Note that due to dependencies between options, some options listed here may not be visible by default in ``menuconfig``.\\n\\nBy convention, all option names are upper-case letters with underscores. When Kconfig generates ``sdkconfig`` and ``sdkconfig.h`` files, option names are prefixed with ``CONFIG_``.

ESP-IDF repository provides automatic update of API reference documentation using :doc:`code markup retrieved by Doxygen from header files <../contribute/documenting-code>`.\\n\\n    2. Update is done on each documentation build by invoking Sphinx extension ``esp_extensions/run_doxygen.py`` for all header files listed in the ``INPUT`` statement of :idf_file:`docs/doxygen/Doxyfile`.\\n\\n    3. Each line of the ``INPUT`` statement  (other than a comment that begins with ``##``) contains a path to header file ``*.h`` that is used to generate corresponding ``*.inc`` files::\\n\\n        ##\\n        ## Wi-Fi - API Reference\\n        ##\\n        ../components/esp32/include/esp_wifi.h \\\\\\n        ../components/esp32/include/esp_smartconfig.h \\\\\\n\\n    4. When the headers are expanded, any macros defined by default in ``sdkconfig.h`` as well as any macros defined in SOC-specific ``include/soc/*_caps.h`` headers will be expanded. This allows the headers to include or exclude material based on the ``IDF_TARGET`` value.\\n\\n    5. The ``*.inc`` files contain formatted reference of API members generated automatically on each documentation build. All ``*.inc`` files are placed in Sphinx ``_build`` directory. To see directives generated, e.g., ``esp_wifi.h``, run ``python gen-dxd.py esp32/include/esp_wifi.h``.\\n\\n    6. To show contents of ``*.inc`` file in documentation, include it as follows::\\n\\n       .. include-build-file:: inc/esp_wifi.inc\\n\\n       For example see :idf_file:`docs/en/api-reference/network/esp_wifi.rst`\\n\\n    7.

       " 'API Conventions\\n===============\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\n.. highlight:: c\\n\\nThis document describes conventions and assumptions common to ESP-IDF Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).\\n\\nESP-IDF provides several kinds of programming interfaces:\\n\\n* C functions, structures, enums, type definitions, and preprocessor macros declared in public header files of ESP-IDF components. Various pages in the API Reference section of the programming guide contain descriptions of these functions, structures, and types.\\n* Build system functions, predefined variables, and options. These are documented in the :ref:`ESP-IDF CMake Build System API <cmake_buildsystem_api>`.\\n* :doc:`Kconfig <kconfig>` options can be used in code and in the build system (``CMakeLists.txt``) files.\\n* :doc:`Host tools <../api-guides/tools/index>` and their command line parameters are also part of the ESP-IDF interfaces.\\n\\nESP-IDF is made up of multiple components where these components either contain code specifically written for ESP chips, or contain a third-party library (i.e., a third-party component). In some cases, third-party components contain an \"ESP-IDF specific\" wrapper in order to provide an interface that is either simpler or better integrated with the rest of ESP-IDF\\'s features. In other cases, third-party components present the original API of the underlying library directly.\\n\\nThe following sections explain some of the aspects of ESP-IDF APIs and their usage.\\n\\nError Handling\\n--------------\\n\\nMost ESP-IDF APIs return error codes defined with the :cpp:type:`esp_err_t` type. See :doc:`Error Handling <../api-guides/error-handling>` section for more information about error handling approaches. :doc:`Error Codes Reference <error-codes>` contains the list of error codes returned by ESP-IDF components.\\n\\n.. _api_reference_config_structures:\\n\\nConfiguration Structures\\n------------------------\\n\\n.. important:: Correct initialization of configuration structures is an important part of making the application compatible with future versions of ESP-IDF.\\n\\nMost initialization, configuration, and installation functions in ESP-IDF (typically named ``..._init()``, ``..._config()``, and ``..._install()``) take a configuration structure pointer as an argument. For example::\\n\\n    const esp_timer_create_args_t my_timer_args = {\\n        .callback = &my_timer_callback,\\n        .arg = callback_arg,\\n        .name = \"my_timer\"\\n    };\\n    esp_timer_handle_t my_timer;\\n    esp_err_t err = esp_timer_create(&my_timer_args, &my_timer);\\n\\nThese functions never store the pointer to the configuration structure, so it is safe to allocate the structure on the stack.\\n\\nThe application must initialize all fields of the structure. The following is incorrect::\\n\\n    esp_timer_create_args_t my_timer_args;\\n    my_timer_args.callback = &my_timer_callback;\\n    /* Incorrect! Fields .arg and .name are not initialized */\\n    esp_timer_create(&my_timer_args, &my_timer);\\n\\nMost ESP-IDF examples use C99 `designated initializers`_ for structure initialization since they provide a concise way of setting a subset of fields, and zero-initializing the remaining fields::\\n\\n    const esp_timer_create_args_t my_timer_args = {\\n        .callback = &my_timer_callback,\\n        /* Correct, fields .arg and .name are zero-initialized */\\n    };\\n\\nThe C++ language supports designated initializer syntax, too, but the initializers must be in the order of declaration. When using ESP-IDF APIs in C++ code, you may consider using the following pattern::\\n\\n    /* Correct, fields .dispatch_method, .name and .skip_unhandled_events are zero-initialized */\\n    const esp_timer_create_args_t my_timer_args = {\\n        .callback = &my_timer_callback,\\n        .arg = &my_arg,\\n    };\\n\\n    ///* Incorrect, .arg is declared after .callback in esp_timer_create_args_t */\\n    //const esp_timer_create_args_t my_timer_args = {\\n    //    .arg = &my_arg,\\n    //    .callback = &my_timer_callback,\\n    //};\\n\\nFor more information on designated initializers, see :ref:`cplusplus_designated_initializers`. Note that C++ language versions older than C++20, which are not the default in the current version of ESP-IDF, do not support designated initializers. If you have to compile code with an older C++ standard than C++20, you may use GCC extensions to produce the following pattern::\\n\\n    esp_timer_create_args_t my_timer_args = {};\\n    /* All the fields are zero-initialized */\\n    my_timer_args.callback = &my_timer_callback;\\n\\nDefault Initializers\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFor some configuration structures, ESP-IDF provides macros for setting default values of fields::\\n\\n    httpd_config_t config = HTTPD_DEFAULT_CONFIG();\\n    /* HTTPD_DEFAULT_CONFIG expands to a designated initializer. Now all fields are set to the default values, and any field can still be modified: */\\n    config.server_port = 8081;\\n    httpd_handle_t server;\\n    esp_err_t err = httpd_start(&server, &config);\\n\\nIt is recommended to use default initializer macros whenever they are provided for a particular configuration structure.\\n\\n.. _api_reference_private_apis:\\n\\nPrivate APIs\\n------------\\n\\nCertain header files in ESP-IDF contain APIs intended to be used only in ESP-IDF source code rather than by the applications. Such header files often contain ``private`` or ``esp_private`` in their name or path. Certain components, such as :doc:`hal <../api-guides/hardware-abstraction>` only contain private APIs.\\n\\nPrivate APIs may be removed or changed in an incompatible way between minor or patch releases.\\n\\n.. _api_reference_example_components:\\n\\nComponents in Example Projects\\n------------------------------\\n\\nESP-IDF examples contain a variety of projects demonstrating the usage of ESP-IDF APIs. In order to reduce code duplication in the examples, a few common helpers are defined inside components that are used by multiple examples. This includes components located in :example:`common_components` directory, as well as some of the components located in the examples themselves. These components are not considered to be part of the ESP-IDF API.\\n\\nIt is not recommended to reference these components directly in custom projects (via ``EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS`` build system variable), as they may change significantly between ESP-IDF versions. When starting a new project based on an ESP-IDF example, copy both the project and the common components it depends on out of ESP-IDF, and treat the common components as part of the project. Note that the common components are written with examples in mind, and might not include all the error handling required for production applications. Before using, take time to read the code and understand if it is applicable to your use case.\\n\\nAPI Stability\\n-------------\\n\\nESP-IDF uses `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ as explained in the :ref:`Versioning Scheme <versioning-scheme>`.\\n\\nMinor and bugfix releases of ESP-IDF guarantee compatibility with previous releases. The sections below explain different aspects and limitations to compatibility.\\n\\nSource-level Compatibility\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-IDF guarantees source-level compatibility of C functions, structures, enums, type definitions, and preprocessor macros declared in public header files of ESP-IDF components. Source-level compatibility implies that the application source code can be recompiled with the newer version of ESP-IDF without changes.\\n\\nThe following changes are allowed between minor versions and do not break source-level compatibility:\\n\\n* Deprecating functions (using the ``deprecated`` attribute) and header files (using a preprocessor ``#warning``). Deprecations are listed in ESP-IDF release notes. It is recommended to update the source code to use the newer functions or files that replace the deprecated ones, however, this is not mandatory. Deprecated functions and files can be removed from major versions of ESP-IDF.\\n* Renaming components, moving source and header files between components — provided that the build system ensures that correct files are still found.\\n* Renaming Kconfig options. Kconfig system\\'s :ref:`backward compatibility <configuration-options-compatibility>` ensures that the original Kconfig option names can still be used by the application in ``sdkconfig`` file, CMake files, and source code.\\n\\nLack of Binary Compatibility\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-IDF does not guarantee binary compatibility between releases. This means that if a precompiled library is built with one ESP-IDF version, it is not guaranteed to work the same way with the next minor or bugfix release. The following are the possible changes that keep source-level compatibility but not binary compatibility:\\n\\n* Changing numerical values for C enum members.\\n* Adding new structure members or changing the order of members. See :ref:`api_reference_config_structures` for tips that help ensure compatibility.\\n* Replacing an ``extern`` function with a ``static inline`` one with the same signature, or vice versa.\\n* Replacing a function-like macro with a compatible C function.\\n\\nOther Exceptions from Compatibility\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhile we try to make upgrading to a new ESP-IDF version easy, there are parts of ESP-IDF that may change between minor versions in an incompatible way. We appreciate issuing reports about any unintended breaking changes that do not fall into the categories below.\\n\\n* :ref:`api_reference_private_apis`.\\n* :ref:`api_reference_example_components`.\\n* Features clearly marked as \"beta\", \"preview\", or \"experimental\".\\n* Changes made to mitigate security issues or to replace insecure default behaviors with secure ones.\\n* Features that were never functional. For example, if it was never possible to use a certain function or an enumeration value, it may get renamed (as part of fixing it) or removed. This includes software features that depend on non-functional chip hardware features.\\n* Unexpected or undefined behavior that is not documented explicitly may be fixed/changed, such as due to missing validation of argument ranges.\\n* Location of :doc:`Kconfig <kconfig>` options in menuconfig.\\n* Location and names of example projects.\\n\\n.. _designated initializers: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/struct_initialization\\n',\n",

It is generally not well suited for low-power applications. However, with ubiquitous deployment, internet connectivity, high data rates, and limitless-range expandability, Ethernet can accommodate nearly all wired communications.\\n\\nNormal IEEE 802.3 compliant Ethernet frames are between 64 and 1518 bytes in length. They are made up of five or six different fields: a destination MAC address (DA), a source MAC address (SA), a type/length field, a data payload, an optional padding field and a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). Additionally, when transmitted on the Ethernet medium, a 7-byte preamble field and Start-of-Frame (SOF) delimiter byte are appended to the beginning of the Ethernet packet.\\n\\nThus the traffic on the twist-pair cabling appears as shown below:\\n\\n.. rackdiag:: ../../../_static/diagrams/ethernet/data_frame_format.diag\\n    :caption: Ethernet Data Frame Format\\n    :align: center\\n\\nPreamble and Start-of-Frame Delimiter\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe preamble contains seven bytes of ``55H``. It allows the receiver to lock onto the stream of data before the actual frame arrives.\\n\\nThe Start-of-Frame Delimiter (SFD) is a binary sequence ``10101011`` (as seen on the physical medium). It is sometimes considered to be part of the preamble.\\n\\nWhen transmitting and receiving data, the preamble and SFD bytes will be automatically generated or stripped from the packets.\\n\\nDestination Address\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe destination address field contains a 6-byte length MAC address of the device that the packet is directed to. If the Least Significant bit in the first byte of the MAC address is set, the address is a multicast destination. For example, 01-00-00-00-F0-00 and 33-45-67-89-AB-CD are multi-cast addresses, while 00-00-00-00-F0-00 and 32-45-67-89-AB-CD are not.\\n\\nPackets with multi-cast destination addresses are designed to arrive and be important to a selected group of Ethernet nodes. If the destination address field is the reserved multicast address, i.e., FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF, the packet is a broadcast packet and it will be directed to everyone sharing the network. If the Least Significant bit in the first byte of the MAC address is clear, the address is a unicast address and will be designed for usage by only the addressed node.\\n\\nNormally the EMAC controller incorporates receive filters which can be used to discard or accept packets with multi-cast, broadcast and/or unicast destination addresses. When transmitting packets, the host controller is responsible for writing the desired destination address into the transmit buffer.\\n\\nSource Address\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe source address field contains a 6-byte length MAC address of the node which created the Ethernet packet. Users of Ethernet must generate a unique MAC address for each controller used. MAC addresses consist of two portions. The first three bytes are known as the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI). OUIs are distributed by the IEEE. The last three bytes are address bytes at the discretion of the company that purchased the OUI. For more information about MAC Address used in ESP-IDF, please see :ref:`MAC Address Allocation <MAC-Address-Allocation>`.\\n\\nWhen transmitting packets, the assigned source MAC address must be written into the transmit buffer by the host controller.\\n\\nType/Length\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe type/length field is a 2-byte field. If the value in this field is <= 1500 (decimal), it is considered a length field and it specifies the amount of non-padding data which follows in the data field. If the value is >= 1536, it represents the protocol the following packet data belongs to. The followings are the most common type values:\\n\\n  * IPv4 = 0800H\\n  * IPv6 = 86DDH\\n  * ARP = 0806H\\n\\nUsers implementing proprietary networks may choose to treat this field as a length field, while applications implementing protocols such as the Internet Protocol (IP) or Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), should program this field with the appropriate type defined by the protocol\\'s specification when transmitting packets.\\n\\nPayload\\n^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe payload field is a variable length field, anywhere from 0 to 1500 bytes. Larger data packets violates Ethernet standards and will be dropped by most Ethernet nodes.\\n\\nThis field contains the client data, such as an IP datagram.\\n\\nPadding and FCS\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe padding field is a variable length field added to meet the IEEE 802.3 specification requirements when small data payloads are used.\\n\\nThe DA, SA, type, payload, and padding of an Ethernet packet must be no smaller than 60 bytes in total. If the required 4-byte FCS field is added, packets must be no smaller than 64 bytes. If the payload field is less than 46-byte long, a padding field is required.\\n\\nThe FCS field is a 4-byte field that contains an industry-standard 32-bit CRC calculated with the data from the DA, SA, type, payload, and padding fields. Given the complexity of calculating a CRC, the hardware normally automatically generates a valid CRC and transmit it. Otherwise, the host controller must generate the CRC and place it in the transmit buffer.\\n\\nNormally, the host controller does not need to concern itself with padding and the CRC which the hardware EMAC will also be able to automatically generate when transmitting and verify when receiving. However, the padding and CRC fields will be written into the receive buffer when packets arrive, so they may be evaluated by the host controller if needed.\\n\\n.. note::\\n    Besides the basic data frame described above, there are two other common frame types in 10/100 Mbps Ethernet: control frames and VLAN-tagged frames. They are not supported in ESP-IDF.\\n\\n.. ------------------------------ Driver Operation --------------------------------\\n\\n.. _driver-configuration-and-installation:\\n\\nConfigure MAC and PHY\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe Ethernet driver is composed of two parts: MAC and PHY.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_EMAC_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    The communication between MAC and PHY can have diverse choices: **MII** (Media Independent Interface), **RMII** (Reduced Media Independent Interface), etc.\\n\\n    .. figure:: ../../../_static/rmii-interface.png\\n        :scale: 80 %\\n        :alt: Ethernet RMII Interface\\n        :figclass: align-center\\n\\n        Ethernet RMII Interface\\n\\n    One of the obvious differences between MII and RMII is signal consumption. MII usually costs up to 18 signals, while the RMII interface can reduce the consumption to 9.\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32\\n\\n        .. note::\\n            ESP-IDF only supports the RMII interface. Therefore, always set :cpp:member:`eth_esp32_emac_config_t::interface` to :cpp:enumerator:`eth_data_interface_t::EMAC_DATA_INTERFACE_RMII` or always select ``CONFIG_ETH_PHY_INTERFACE_RMII`` in the Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_ETH_PHY_INTERFACE`.\\n\\n    .. only:: not esp32\\n\\n        .. note::\\n            ESP-IDF only supports the RMII interface. Therefore, always set :cpp:member:`eth_esp32_emac_config_t::interface` to :cpp:enumerator:`eth_data_interface_t::EMAC_DATA_INTERFACE_RMII`.\\n\\n    In RMII mode, both the receiver and transmitter signals are referenced to the ``REF_CLK``. ``REF_CLK`` **must be stable during any access to PHY and MAC**. Generally, there are three ways to generate the ``REF_CLK`` depending on the PHY device in your design:\\n\\n    * Some PHY chips can derive the ``REF_CLK`` from its externally connected 25 MHz crystal oscillator (as seen the option **a** in the picture). In this case, you should configure :cpp:member:`eth_mac_clock_config_t::clock_mode` of :cpp:member:`eth_esp32_emac_config_t::clock_config` to :cpp:enumerator:`emac_rmii_clock_mode_t::EMAC_CLK_EXT_IN`.\\n\\n    * Some PHY chip uses an externally connected 50MHz crystal oscillator or other clock sources, which can also be used as the ``REF_CLK`` for the MAC side (as seen the option **b** in the picture).

The magic behind that is the pause frame, which was defined in IEEE 802.3x.\\n\\nPause frame is a special Ethernet frame used to carry the pause command, whose EtherType field is ``0x8808``, with the Control opcode set to ``0x0001``. Only stations configured for full-duplex operation may send pause frames. When a station wishes to pause the other end of a link, it sends a pause frame to the 48-bit reserved multicast address of ``01-80-C2-00-00-01``. The pause frame also includes the period of pause time being requested, in the form of a two-byte integer, ranging from ``0`` to ``65535``.\\n\\nAfter the Ethernet driver installation, the flow control feature is disabled by default. You can enable it by:\\n\\n.. highlight:: c\\n\\n::\\n\\n    bool flow_ctrl_enable = true;\\n    esp_eth_ioctl(eth_handle, ETH_CMD_S_FLOW_CTRL, &flow_ctrl_enable);\\n\\nOne thing that should be kept in mind is that the pause frame ability is advertised to the peer end by PHY during auto-negotiation. The Ethernet driver sends a pause frame only when both sides of the link support it.\\n\\n.. -------------------------------- Examples -----------------------------------\\n\\nApplication Examples\\n--------------------\\n\\n  * Ethernet basic example: :example:`ethernet/basic`\\n  * Ethernet iperf example: :example:`ethernet/iperf`\\n  * Ethernet to Wi-Fi AP \"router\": :example:`network/eth2ap`\\n  * Wi-Fi station to Ethernet \"bridge\": :example:`network/sta2eth`\\n  * Most protocol examples should also work for Ethernet: :example:`protocols`\\n\\n.. ------------------------------ Advanced Topics -------------------------------\\n\\n.. _advanced-topics:\\n\\nAdvanced Topics\\n---------------\\n\\nCustom PHY Driver\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThere are multiple PHY manufacturers with wide portfolios of chips available. The ESP-IDF already supports several PHY chips however one can easily get to a point where none of them satisfies the user\\'s actual needs due to price, features, stock availability, etc.\\n\\nLuckily, a management interface between EMAC and PHY is standardized by IEEE 802.3 in Section 22.2.4 Management Functions. It defines provisions of the so-called \"MII Management Interface\" to control the PHY and gather status from the PHY. A set of management registers is defined to control chip behavior, link properties, auto-negotiation configuration, etc. This basic management functionality is addressed by :component_file:`esp_eth/src/esp_eth_phy_802_3.c` in ESP-IDF and so it makes the creation of a new custom PHY chip driver quite a simple task.\\n\\n.. note::\\n    Always consult with PHY datasheet since some PHY chips may not comply with IEEE 802.3, Section 22.2.4. It does not mean you are not able to create a custom PHY driver, but it just requires more effort. You will have to define all PHY management functions.\\n\\nThe majority of PHY management functionality required by the ESP-IDF Ethernet driver is covered by the :component_file:`esp_eth/src/esp_eth_phy_802_3.c`. However, the following may require developing chip-specific management functions:\\n\\n    * Link status which is almost always chip-specific\\n    * Chip initialization, even though not strictly required, should be customized to at least ensure that the expected chip is used\\n    * Chip-specific features configuration\\n\\n**Steps to create a custom PHY driver:**\\n\\n1. Define vendor-specific registry layout based on the PHY datasheet. See :component_file:`esp_eth/src/esp_eth_phy_ip101.c` as an example.\\n2. Prepare derived PHY management object info structure which:\\n\\n    * must contain at least parent IEEE 802.3 :cpp:class:`phy_802_3_t` object\\n    * optionally contain additional variables needed to support non-IEEE 802.3 or customized functionality. See :component_file:`esp_eth/src/esp_eth_phy_ksz80xx.c` as an example.\\n\\n3. Define chip-specific management call-back functions.\\n4. Initialize parent IEEE 802.3 object and re-assign chip-specific management call-back functions.\\n\\nOnce you finish the new custom PHY driver implementation, consider sharing it among other users via `IDF Component Registry <https://components.espressif.com/>`_.\\n\\n.. ---------------------------- API Reference ----------------------------------\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/eth_types.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_eth.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_eth_driver.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_eth_com.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_eth_mac.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_eth_phy.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_eth_phy_802_3.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_eth_netif_glue.inc\\n',\n",

It is a secure and standardized provisioning protocol for configuration of Wi-Fi Devices. With Easy Connect, adding a new device to a network is as simple as scanning a QR Code. This reduces complexity and enhances user experience while onboarding devices without UI like Smart Home and IoT products.

       " 'ESP-NOW\\n=======\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nESP-NOW is a kind of connectionless Wi-Fi communication protocol that is defined by Espressif. In ESP-NOW, application data is encapsulated in a vendor-specific action frame and then transmitted from one Wi-Fi device to another without connection.\\n\\nCTR with CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP) is used to protect the action frame for security. ESP-NOW is widely used in smart light, remote controlling, sensor, etc.\\n\\nFrame Format\\n------------\\n\\nESP-NOW uses a vendor-specific action frame to transmit ESP-NOW data. The default ESP-NOW bit rate is 1 Mbps. The format of the vendor-specific action frame is as follows:\\n\\n.. highlight:: none\\n\\n::\\n\\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    | MAC Header | Category Code | Organization Identifier | Random Values | Vendor Specific Content |   FCS   |\\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n      24 bytes         1 byte              3 bytes               4 bytes             7-257 bytes        4 bytes\\n\\n- Category Code: The Category Code field is set to the value (127) indicating the vendor-specific category.\\n- Organization Identifier: The Organization Identifier contains a unique identifier (0x18fe34), which is the first three bytes of MAC address applied by Espressif.\\n- Random Value: The Random Value filed is used to prevents relay attacks.\\n- Vendor Specific Content: The Vendor Specific Content contains vendor-specific fields as follows:\\n\\n.. highlight:: none\\n\\n::\\n\\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    | Element ID | Length | Organization Identifier | Type | Version |    Body    |\\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n        1 byte     1 byte            3 bytes         1 byte   1 byte   0-250 bytes\\n\\n- Element ID: The Element ID field is set to the value (221), indicating the vendor-specific element.\\n- Length: The length is the total length of Organization Identifier, Type, Version and Body.\\n- Organization Identifier: The Organization Identifier contains a unique identifier (0x18fe34), which is the first three bytes of MAC address applied by Espressif.\\n- Type: The Type field is set to the value (4) indicating ESP-NOW.\\n- Version: The Version field is set to the version of ESP-NOW.\\n- Body: The Body contains the ESP-NOW data.\\n\\nAs ESP-NOW is connectionless, the MAC header is a little different from that of standard frames. The FromDS and ToDS bits of FrameControl field are both 0. The first address field is set to the destination address. The second address field is set to the source address. The third address field is set to broadcast address (0xff:0xff:0xff:0xff:0xff:0xff).\\n\\nSecurity\\n--------\\n\\nESP-NOW uses the CCMP method, which is described in IEEE Std. 802.11-2012, to protect the vendor-specific action frame. The Wi-Fi device maintains a Primary Master Key (PMK) and several Local Master Keys (LMK). The lengths of both PMK and LMk are 16 bytes.\\n\\n    * PMK is used to encrypt LMK with the AES-128 algorithm. Call :cpp:func:`esp_now_set_pmk()` to set PMK. If PMK is not set, a default PMK will be used.\\n    * LMK of the paired device is used to encrypt the vendor-specific action frame with the CCMP method. The maximum number of different LMKs is six. If the LMK of the paired device is not set, the vendor-specific action frame will not be encrypted.\\n\\nEncrypting multicast vendor-specific action frame is not supported.\\n\\nInitialization and Deinitialization\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nCall :cpp:func:`esp_now_init()` to initialize ESP-NOW and :cpp:func:`esp_now_deinit()` to de-initialize ESP-NOW. ESP-NOW data must be transmitted after Wi-Fi is started, so it is recommended to start Wi-Fi before initializing ESP-NOW and stop Wi-Fi after de-initializing ESP-NOW.\\n\\nWhen :cpp:func:`esp_now_deinit()` is called, all of the information of paired devices are deleted.\\n\\nAdd Paired Device\\n-----------------\\n\\nCall :cpp:func:`esp_now_add_peer()` to add the device to the paired device list before you send data to this device. If security is enabled, the LMK must be set. You can send ESP-NOW data via both the Station and the SoftAP interface. Make sure that the interface is enabled before sending ESP-NOW data.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c2\\n\\n    The maximum number of paired devices is 20, and the paired encryption devices are no more than 4, the default is 2. If you want to change the number of paired encryption devices, set :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_ESPNOW_MAX_ENCRYPT_NUM` in the Wi-Fi component configuration menu.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32s2 or esp32s3 or esp32c3 or esp32c6\\n\\n    The maximum number of paired devices is 20, and the paired encryption devices are no more than 17, the default is 7. If you want to change the number of paired encryption devices, set :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_ESPNOW_MAX_ENCRYPT_NUM` in the Wi-Fi component configuration menu.\\n\\nA device with a broadcast MAC address must be added before sending broadcast data. The range of the channel of paired devices is from 0 to 14. If the channel is set to 0, data will be sent on the current channel. Otherwise, the channel must be set as the channel that the local device is on.\\n\\nSend ESP-NOW Data\\n-----------------\\n\\nCall :cpp:func:`esp_now_send()` to send ESP-NOW data and :cpp:func:`esp_now_register_send_cb()` to register sending callback function. It will return `ESP_NOW_SEND_SUCCESS` in sending callback function if the data is received successfully on the MAC layer. Otherwise, it will return `ESP_NOW_SEND_FAIL`. Several reasons can lead to ESP-NOW fails to send data. For example, the destination device does not exist; the channels of the devices are not the same; the action frame is lost when transmitting on the air, etc. It is not guaranteed that application layer can receive the data. If necessary, send back ack data when receiving ESP-NOW data. If receiving ack data timeouts, retransmit the ESP-NOW data. A sequence number can also be assigned to ESP-NOW data to drop the duplicate data.\\n\\nIf there is a lot of ESP-NOW data to send, call :cpp:func:`esp_now_send()` to send less than or equal to 250 bytes of data once a time. Note that too short interval between sending two ESP-NOW data may lead to disorder of sending callback function. So, it is recommended that sending the next ESP-NOW data after the sending callback function of the previous sending has returned. The sending callback function runs from a high-priority Wi-Fi task. So, do not do lengthy operations in the callback function. Instead, post the necessary data to a queue and handle it from a lower priority task.\\n\\nReceiving ESP-NOW Data\\n----------------------\\n\\nCall :cpp:func:`esp_now_register_recv_cb()` to register receiving callback function.  Call the receiving callback function when receiving ESP-NOW. The receiving callback function also runs from the Wi-Fi task. So, do not do lengthy operations in the callback function.\\nInstead, post the necessary data to a queue and handle it from a lower priority task.\\n\\nConfig ESP-NOW Rate\\n-------------------\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32s2 or esp32s3 or esp32c2 or esp32c3\\n\\n    Call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_config_espnow_rate()` to config ESP-NOW rate of specified interface. Make sure that the interface is enabled before config rate. This API should be called after :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_start()`.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c6\\n\\n    Call :cpp:func:`esp_now_set_peer_rate_config()` to configure ESP-NOW rate of each peer. Make sure that the peer is added before configuring the rate. This API should be called after :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_start()` and :cpp:func:`esp_now_add_peer()`.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_config_espnow_rate()` is deprecated, please use cpp::func:`esp_now_set_peer_rate_config()` instead.\\n\\nConfig ESP-NOW Power-saving Parameter\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nSleep is supported only when {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is configured as station.\\n\\nCall :cpp:func:`esp_now_set_wake_window()` to configure Window for ESP-NOW RX at sleep. The default value is the maximum, which allowing RX all the time.\\n\\nIf Power-saving is needed for ESP-NOW, call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_connectionless_module_set_wake_interval()` to configure Interval as well.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Please refer to :ref:`connectionless module power save <connectionless-module-power-save>` to get more detail.\\n\\nApplication Examples\\n--------------------\\n\\n* Example of sending and receiving ESP-NOW data between two devices: :example:`wifi/espnow`.\\n\\n* For more application examples of how to use ESP-NOW, please visit `ESP-NOW <https://github.com/espressif/esp-now>`_ repository.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_now.inc\\n',\n",

The following diagram illustrates the ESP-WIFI-MESH software stack.\\n\\n.. _mesh-going-to-software-stack:\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/mesh-software-stack.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: ESP-WIFI-MESH Software Stack\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-WIFI-MESH Software Stack\\n\\n.. _mesh-events:\\n\\nSystem Events\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAn application interfaces with ESP-WIFI-MESH via **ESP-WIFI-MESH Events**. Since ESP-WIFI-MESH is built atop the Wi-Fi stack, it is also possible for the application to interface with the Wi-Fi driver via the **Wi-Fi Event Task**. The following diagram illustrates the interfaces for the various System Events in an ESP-WIFI-MESH application.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/mesh-events-delivery.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: ESP-WIFI-MESH System Events Delivery\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-WIFI-MESH System Events Delivery\\n\\nThe :cpp:type:`mesh_event_id_t` defines all possible ESP-WIFI-MESH events and can indicate events such as the connection/disconnection of parent/child. Before ESP-WIFI-MESH events can be used, the application must register a **Mesh Events handler** via :cpp:func:`esp_event_handler_register` to the default event task. The Mesh Events handler that is registered contain handlers for each ESP-WIFI-MESH event relevant to the application.\\n\\nTypical use cases of mesh events include using events such as :cpp:enumerator:`MESH_EVENT_PARENT_CONNECTED` and :cpp:enumerator:`MESH_EVENT_CHILD_CONNECTED` to indicate when a node can begin transmitting data upstream and downstream respectively. Likewise, :cpp:enumerator:`IP_EVENT_STA_GOT_IP` and :cpp:enumerator:`IP_EVENT_STA_LOST_IP` can be used to indicate when the root node can and cannot transmit data to the external IP network.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    When using ESP-WIFI-MESH under self-organized mode, users must ensure that no calls to Wi-Fi API are made. This is due to the fact that the self-organizing mode will internally make Wi-Fi API calls to connect/disconnect/scan etc. **Any Wi-Fi calls from the application (including calls from callbacks and handlers of Wi-Fi events) may interfere with ESP-WIFI-MESH\\'s self-organizing behavior**. Therefore, users should not call Wi-Fi APIs after :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_start` is called, and before :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_stop` is called.\\n\\nLwIP & ESP-WIFI-MESH\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe application can access the ESP-WIFI-MESH stack directly without having to go through the LwIP stack. The LwIP stack is only required by the root node to transmit/receive data to/from an external IP network. However, since every node can potentially become the root node (due to automatic root node selection), each node must still initialize the LwIP stack.\\n\\n**Each node that could become root is required to initialize LwIP by calling** :cpp:func:`esp_netif_init`. In order to prevent non-root node access to LwIP, the application should not create or register any network interfaces using esp_netif APIs.\\n\\n\\n    ESP-WIFI-MESH requires a root node to be connected with a router. Therefore, in the event that a node becomes the root, **the corresponding handler must start the DHCP client service and immediately obtain an IP address**. Doing so will allow other nodes to begin transmitting/receiving packets to/from the external IP network. However, this step is unnecessary if static IP settings are used.\\n\\n\\n.. ---------------------- Writing a Mesh Application --------------------------\\n\\n.. _mesh-writing-mesh-application:\\n\\nWriting an ESP-WIFI-MESH Application\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe prerequisites for starting ESP-WIFI-MESH is to initialize LwIP and Wi-Fi, The following code snippet demonstrates the necessary prerequisite steps before ESP-WIFI-MESH itself can be initialized.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_netif_init());\\n\\n    /*  event initialization */\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_event_loop_create_default());\\n\\n    /*  Wi-Fi initialization */\\n    wifi_init_config_t config = WIFI_INIT_CONFIG_DEFAULT();\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_wifi_init(&config));\\n    /*  register IP events handler */\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_event_handler_register(IP_EVENT, IP_EVENT_STA_GOT_IP, &ip_event_handler, NULL));\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_wifi_set_storage(WIFI_STORAGE_FLASH));\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_wifi_start());\\n\\nAfter initializing LwIP and Wi-Fi, the process of getting an ESP-WIFI-MESH network up and running can be summarized into the following three steps:\\n\\n1. :ref:`mesh-initialize-mesh`\\n2. :ref:`mesh-configuring-mesh`\\n3. :ref:`mesh-start-mesh`\\n\\n.. _mesh-initialize-mesh:\\n\\nInitialize Mesh\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe following code snippet demonstrates how to initialize ESP-WIFI-MESH\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    /*  mesh initialization */\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_mesh_init());\\n    /*  register mesh events handler */\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_event_handler_register(MESH_EVENT, ESP_EVENT_ANY_ID, &mesh_event_handler, NULL));\\n\\n.. _mesh-configuring-mesh:\\n\\nConfiguring an ESP-WIFI-MESH Network\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. todo - Add note about unified configuration\\n\\nESP-WIFI-MESH is configured via :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_set_config` which receives its arguments using the :cpp:type:`mesh_cfg_t` structure.

After connecting, the application can start transmitting and receiving packets over the ESP-WIFI-MESH network using :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_send` and :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_recv`.\\n\\n\\n.. --------------------- ESP-WIFI-MESH Application Examples ------------------------\\n\\n.. _mesh-self-organized-behavior:\\n\\nSelf-Organized Networking\\n-------------------------\\n\\nSelf-organized networking is a feature of ESP-WIFI-MESH where nodes can autonomously scan/select/connect/reconnect to other nodes and routers. This feature allows an ESP-WIFI-MESH network to operate with high degree of autonomy by making the network robust to dynamic network topologies and conditions. With self-organized networking enabled, nodes in an ESP-WIFI-MESH network are able to carry out the following actions without autonomously:\\n\\n- Selection or election of the root node (see **Automatic Root Node Selection** in :ref:`mesh-building-a-network`)\\n- Selection of a preferred parent node (see **Parent Node Selection** in :ref:`mesh-building-a-network`)\\n- Automatic reconnection upon detecting a disconnection (see **Intermediate Parent Node Failure** in :ref:`mesh-managing-a-network`)\\n\\nWhen self-organized networking is enabled, the ESP-WIFI-MESH stack will internally make calls to Wi-Fi APIs. Therefore, **the application layer should not make any calls to Wi-Fi APIs whilst self-organized networking is enabled as doing so would risk interfering with ESP-WIFI-MESH**.\\n\\nToggling Self-Organized Networking\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSelf-organized networking can be enabled or disabled by the application at runtime by calling the :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_set_self_organized` function. The function has the two following parameters:\\n\\n- ``bool enable`` specifies whether to enable or disable self-organized networking.\\n\\n- ``bool select_parent`` specifies whether a new parent node should be selected when enabling self-organized networking. Selecting a new parent has different effects depending the node type and the node\\'s current state.

For example, an application may want to manually scan for neighboring APs. However, **self-organized networking must be disabled before the application calls any Wi-Fi APIs**. This will prevent the ESP-WIFI-MESH stack from attempting to call any Wi-Fi APIs and potentially interfering with the application\\'s calls.\\n\\nTherefore, application calls to Wi-Fi APIs should be placed in between calls of :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_set_self_organized` which disable and enable self-organized networking.

       " \"Wi-Fi Aware\\\\ :sup:`TM` (NAN)\\n===================================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nWi-Fi Aware\\\\ :sup:`TM` or NAN (Neighbor Awareness Networking) is a protocol that allows Wi-Fi devices to discover services in their proximity. Typically, location-based services are based on querying servers for information about the environment and the location knowledge is based on GPS or other location reckoning techniques. However, NAN does not require real-time connection to servers, GPS or other geo-location, but instead uses direct device-to-device Wi-Fi to discover and exchange information. NAN scales effectively in dense Wi-Fi environments and complements the connectivity of Wi-Fi by providing information about people and services in the proximity.\\n\\nMultiple NAN devices which are in the vicinity form a NAN cluster which allows them to communicate with each other. Devices within a NAN cluster can advertise (Publish method) or look for (Subscribe method) services using NAN Service Discovery protocols. Matching of services is done by service name, once a match is found, a device can either send a message or establish an IPv6 Datapath with the peer.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports Wi-Fi Aware in standalone mode with support for both Service Discovery and Datapath. Wi-Fi Aware is still an evolving protocol. Please refer to Wi-Fi Alliance's official page on `Wi-Fi Aware <https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/wi-fi-aware>`_ for more information. Many Android smartphones with Android 8 or higher support Wi-Fi Aware. Refer to Android's developer guide on Wi-Fi Aware `Wi-Fi Aware <https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/wi-fi-aware>`_ for more information.\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\nA pair of examples for a Publisher-Subscriber use case: :example:`wifi/wifi_aware/nan_publisher` and :example:`wifi/wifi_aware/nan_subscriber`. A user interactive console example to explore full functionality of Wi-Fi Aware: :example:`wifi/wifi_aware/nan_console`.

       " 'ESP-NETIF\\n=========\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThe purpose of the ESP-NETIF library is twofold:\\n\\n- It provides an abstraction layer for the application on top of the TCP/IP stack. This allows applications to choose between IP stacks in the future.\\n- The APIs it provides are thread-safe, even if the underlying TCP/IP stack APIs are not.\\n\\nESP-IDF currently implements ESP-NETIF for the lwIP TCP/IP stack only. However, the adapter itself is TCP/IP implementation-agnostic and allows different implementations.\\n\\nIt is also possible to use a custom TCP/IP stack with ESP-IDF, provided it implements BSD API. For more information on building ESP-IDF without lwIP, please refer to :idf_file:`components/esp_netif_stack/README.md`.\\n\\nSome ESP-NETIF API functions are intended to be called by application code, for example, to get or set interface IP addresses, and configure DHCP. Other functions are intended for internal ESP-IDF use by the network driver layer.\\n\\nIn many cases, applications do not need to call ESP-NETIF APIs directly as they are called by the default network event handlers.\\n\\n\\n.. _esp-netif structure:\\n\\nESP-NETIF Architecture\\n----------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n\\n                         |          (A) USER CODE                 |\\n                         |                 Apps                   |\\n        .................| init          settings      events     |\\n        .                +----------------------------------------+\\n        .                   .                |           *\\n        .                   .                |           *\\n    --------+            +===========================+   *     +-----------------------+\\n            |            | new/config   get/set/apps |   *     | init                  |\\n            |            |                           |...*.....| Apps (DHCP, SNTP)     |\\n            |            |---------------------------|   *     |                       |\\n      init  |            |                           |****     |                       |\\n      start |************|  event handler            |*********|  DHCP                 |\\n      stop  |            |                           |         |                       |\\n            |            |---------------------------|         |                       |\\n            |            |                           |         |    NETIF              |\\n      +-----|            |                           |         +-----------------+     |\\n      | glue|---<----|---|  esp_netif_transmit       |--<------| netif_output    |     |\\n      |     |        |   |                           |         |                 |     |\\n      |     |--->----|---|  esp_netif_receive        |-->------| netif_input     |     |\\n      |     |        |   |                           |         + ----------------+     |\\n      |     |...<....|...|  esp_netif_free_rx_buffer |...<.....| packet buffer         |\\n      +-----|     |  |   |                           |         |                       |\\n            |     |  |   |                           |         |         (D)           |\\n      (B)   |     |  |   |          (C)              |         +-----------------------+\\n    --------+     |  |   +===========================+\\n  COMMUNICATION   |  |                                               NETWORK STACK\\n  DRIVER          |  |           ESP-NETIF\\n                  |  |                                         +------------------+\\n                  |  |   +---------------------------+.........| open/close       |\\n                  |  |   |                           |         |                  |\\n                  |  -<--|  l2tap_write              |-----<---|  write           |\\n                  |      |                           |         |                  |\\n                  ---->--|  esp_vfs_l2tap_eth_filter |----->---|  read            |\\n                         |                           |         |                  |\\n                         |            (E)            |         +------------------+\\n                         +---------------------------+\\n                                                                     USER CODE\\n                               ESP-NETIF L2 TAP\\n\\n\\nData and Event Flow in the Diagram\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n* ``........``     Initialization line from user code to ESP-NETIF and communication driver\\n\\n* ``--<--->--``    Data packets going from communication media to TCP/IP stack and back\\n\\n* ``********``     Events aggregated in ESP-NETIF propagate to the driver, user code, and network stack\\n\\n* ``|``            User settings and runtime configuration\\n\\nESP-NETIF Interaction\\n---------------------\\n\\nA) User Code, Boilerplate\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nOverall application interaction with a specific IO driver for communication media and configured TCP/IP network stack is abstracted using ESP-NETIF APIs and is outlined as below:\\n\\nA) Initialization code\\n\\n  1) Initializes IO driver\\n  2) Creates a new instance of ESP-NETIF and configure it with\\n\\n    * ESP-NETIF specific options (flags, behavior, name)\\n    * Network stack options (netif init and input functions, not publicly available)\\n    * IO driver specific options (transmit, free rx buffer functions, IO driver handle)\\n\\n  3) Attaches the IO driver handle to the ESP-NETIF instance created in the above steps\\n  4) Configures event handlers\\n\\n    * Use default handlers for common interfaces defined in IO drivers; or define a specific handler for customized behavior or new interfaces\\n    * Register handlers for app-related events (such as IP lost or acquired)\\n\\nB) Interaction with network interfaces using ESP-NETIF API\\n\\n  1) Gets and sets TCP/IP-related parameters (DHCP, IP, etc)\\n  2) Receives IP events (connect or disconnect)\\n  3) Controls application lifecycle (set interface up or down)\\n\\n\\nB) Communication Driver, IO Driver, and Media Driver\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nCommunication driver plays these two important roles in relation to ESP-NETIF:\\n\\n1) Event handlers: Defines behavior patterns of interaction with ESP-NETIF (e.g., ethernet link-up -> turn netif on)\\n\\n2) Glue IO layer: Adapts the input or output functions to use ESP-NETIF transmit, receive, and free receive buffer\\n\\n  * Installs driver_transmit to the appropriate ESP-NETIF object so that outgoing packets from the network stack are passed to the IO driver\\n  * Calls :cpp:func:`esp_netif_receive()` to pass incoming data to the network stack\\n\\n\\nC) ESP-NETIF\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-NETIF serves as an intermediary between an IO driver and a network stack, connecting the packet data path between the two. It provides a set of interfaces for attaching a driver to an ESP-NETIF object at runtime and configures a network stack during compiling. Additionally, a set of APIs is provided to control the network interface lifecycle and its TCP/IP properties. As an overview, the ESP-NETIF public interface can be divided into six groups:\\n\\n1) Initialization APIs (to create and configure ESP-NETIF instance)\\n2) Input or Output API (for passing data between IO driver and network stack)\\n3) Event or Action API\\n\\n  * Used for network interface lifecycle management\\n  * ESP-NETIF provides building blocks for designing event handlers\\n\\n4) Setters and Getters API for basic network interface properties\\n5) Network stack abstraction API: enabling user interaction with TCP/IP stack\\n\\n  * Set interface up or down\\n  * DHCP server and client API\\n  * DNS API\\n  * `SNTP API`_\\n\\n6) Driver conversion utilities API\\n\\n\\nD) Network Stack\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe network stack has no public interaction with application code with regard to public interfaces and shall be fully abstracted by ESP-NETIF API.\\n\\n\\nE) ESP-NETIF L2 TAP Interface\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe ESP-NETIF L2 TAP interface is a mechanism in ESP-IDF used to access Data Link Layer (L2 per OSI/ISO) for frame reception and transmission from the user application. Its typical usage in the embedded world might be the implementation of non-IP-related protocols, e.g., PTP, Wake on LAN. Note that only Ethernet (IEEE 802.3) is currently supported.\\n\\nFrom a user perspective, the ESP-NETIF L2 TAP interface is accessed using file descriptors of VFS, which provides file-like interfacing (using functions like ``open()``, ``read()``, ``write()``, etc). To learn more, refer to :doc:`/api-reference/storage/vfs`.\\n\\nThere is only one ESP-NETIF L2 TAP interface device (path name) available. However multiple file descriptors with different configurations can be opened at a time since the ESP-NETIF L2 TAP interface can be understood as a generic entry point to the Layer 2 infrastructure. What is important is then the specific configuration of the particular file descriptor. It can be configured to give access to a specific Network Interface identified by ``if_key`` (e.g., `ETH_DEF`) and to filter only specific frames based on their type (e.g., Ethernet type in the case of IEEE 802.3). Filtering only specific frames is crucial since the ESP-NETIF L2 TAP needs to exist along with the IP stack and so the IP-related traffic (IP, ARP, etc.) should not be passed directly to the user application. Even though this option is still configurable, it is not recommended in standard use cases. Filtering is also advantageous from the perspective of the user\\'s application, as it only gets access to the frame types it is interested in, and the remaining traffic is either passed to other L2 TAP file descriptors or to the IP stack.\\n\\nESP-NETIF L2 TAP Interface Usage Manual\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nInitialization\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nTo be able to use the ESP-NETIF L2 TAP interface, it needs to be enabled in Kconfig by :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_NETIF_L2_TAP` first and then registered by :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_l2tap_intf_register()` prior usage of any VFS function.\\n\\n``open()``\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\nOnce the ESP-NETIF L2 TAP is registered, it can be opened at path name \"/dev/net/tap\". The same path name can be opened multiple times up to :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_NETIF_L2_TAP_MAX_FDS` and multiple file descriptors with a different configuration may access the Data Link Layer frames.\\n\\nThe ESP-NETIF L2 TAP can be opened with the ``O_NONBLOCK`` file status flag to make sure the ``read()`` does not block. Note that the ``write()`` may block in the current implementation when accessing a Network interface since it is a shared resource among multiple ESP-NETIF L2 TAP file descriptors and IP stack, and there is currently no queuing mechanism deployed. The file status flag can be retrieved and modified using ``fcntl()``.\\n\\nOn success, ``open()`` returns the new file descriptor (a nonnegative integer). On error, -1 is returned, and ``errno`` is set to indicate the error.\\n\\n``ioctl()``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe newly opened ESP-NETIF L2 TAP file descriptor needs to be configured prior to its usage since it is not bounded to any specific Network Interface and no frame type filter is configured. The following configuration options are available to do so:\\n\\n  * ``L2TAP_S_INTF_DEVICE`` - bounds the file descriptor to a specific Network Interface that is identified by its ``if_key``. ESP-NETIF Network Interface ``if_key`` is passed to ``ioctl()`` as the third parameter. Note that default Network Interfaces ``if_key``\\'s used in ESP-IDF can be found in :component_file:`esp_netif/include/esp_netif_defaults.h`.\\n  * ``L2TAP_S_DEVICE_DRV_HNDL`` - is another way to bound the file descriptor to a specific Network Interface. In this case, the Network interface is identified directly by IO Driver handle (e.g., :cpp:type:`esp_eth_handle_t` in case of Ethernet). The IO Driver handle is passed to ``ioctl()`` as the third parameter.\\n  * ``L2TAP_S_RCV_FILTER`` - sets the filter to frames with the type to be passed to the file descriptor. In the case of Ethernet frames, the frames are to be filtered based on the Length and Ethernet type field. In case the filter value is set less than or equal to 0x05DC, the Ethernet type field is considered to represent IEEE802.3 Length Field, and all frames with values in interval <0, 0x05DC> at that field are passed to the file descriptor. The IEEE802.2 logical link control (LLC) resolution is then expected to be performed by the user\\'s application. In case the filter value is set greater than 0x05DC, the Ethernet type field is considered to represent protocol identification and only frames that are equal to the set value are to be passed to the file descriptor.\\n\\nAll above-set configuration options have a getter counterpart option to read the current settings.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n    The file descriptor needs to be firstly bounded to a specific Network Interface by ``L2TAP_S_INTF_DEVICE`` or ``L2TAP_S_DEVICE_DRV_HNDL`` to make ``L2TAP_S_RCV_FILTER`` option available.\\n\\n.. note::\\n    VLAN-tagged frames are currently not recognized. If the user needs to process VLAN-tagged frames, they need a set filter to be equal to the VLAN tag (i.e., 0x8100 or 0x88A8) and process the VLAN-tagged frames in the user application.\\n\\n.. note::\\n    ``L2TAP_S_DEVICE_DRV_HNDL`` is particularly useful when the user\\'s application does not require the usage of an IP stack and so ESP-NETIF is not required to be initialized too. As a result, Network Interface cannot be identified by its ``if_key`` and hence it needs to be identified directly by its IO Driver handle.\\n\\n| On success, ``ioctl()`` returns 0. On error, -1 is returned, and ``errno`` is set to indicate the error.\\n| * EBADF - not a valid file descriptor.\\n| * EACCES - options change is denied in this state (e.g., file descriptor has not been bounded to Network interface yet).\\n| * EINVAL - invalid configuration argument. Ethernet type filter is already used by other file descriptors on that same Network interface.\\n| * ENODEV - no such Network Interface which is tried to be assigned to the file descriptor exists.\\n| * ENOSYS - unsupported operation, passed configuration option does not exist.\\n\\n``fcntl()``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n``fcntl()`` is used to manipulate with properties of opened ESP-NETIF L2 TAP file descriptor.\\n\\nThe following commands manipulate the status flags associated with the file descriptor:\\n\\n  * ``F_GETFD`` - the function returns the file descriptor flags, and the third argument is ignored.\\n  * ``F_SETFD`` - sets the file descriptor flags to the value specified by the third argument. Zero is returned.\\n\\n| On success, ``ioctl()`` returns 0. On error, -1 is returned, and ``errno`` is set to indicate the error.\\n| * EBADF - not a valid file descriptor.\\n| * ENOSYS - unsupported command.\\n\\n``read()``\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\nOpened and configured ESP-NETIF L2 TAP file descriptor can be accessed by ``read()`` to get inbound frames. The read operation can be either blocking or non-blocking based on the actual state of the ``O_NONBLOCK`` file status flag. When the file status flag is set to blocking, the read operation waits until a frame is received and the context is switched to other tasks. When the file status flag is set to non-blocking, the read operation returns immediately. In such case, either a frame is returned if it was already queued or the function indicates the queue is empty. The number of queued frames associated with one file descriptor is limited by :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_NETIF_L2_TAP_RX_QUEUE_SIZE` Kconfig option. Once the number of queued frames reached a configured threshold, the newly arrived frames are dropped until the queue has enough room to accept incoming traffic (Tail Drop queue management).\\n\\n| On success, ``read()`` returns the number of bytes read. Zero is returned when the size of the destination buffer is 0. On error, -1 is returned, and ``errno`` is set to indicate the error.\\n| * EBADF - not a valid file descriptor.\\n| * EAGAIN - the file descriptor has been marked non-blocking (``O_NONBLOCK``), and the read would block.\\n\\n``write()``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\nA raw Data Link Layer frame can be sent to Network Interface via opened and configured ESP-NETIF L2 TAP file descriptor. The user\\'s application is responsible to construct the whole frame except for fields which are added automatically by the physical interface device. The following fields need to be constructed by the user\\'s application in case of an Ethernet link: source/destination MAC addresses, Ethernet type, actual protocol header, and user data. The length of these fields is as follows:\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n    :widths: 20 20 20 30\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    * - Destination MAC\\n      - Source MAC\\n      - Type/Length\\n      - Payload (protocol header/data)\\n    * - 6 B\\n      - 6 B\\n      - 2 B\\n      - 0-1486 B\\n\\nIn other words, there is no additional frame processing performed by the ESP-NETIF L2 TAP interface. It only checks the Ethernet type of the frame is the same as the filter configured in the file descriptor. If the Ethernet type is different, an error is returned and the frame is not sent. Note that the ``write()`` may block in the current implementation when accessing a Network interface since it is a shared resource among multiple ESP-NETIF L2 TAP file descriptors and IP stack, and there is currently no queuing mechanism deployed.\\n\\n| On success, ``write()`` returns the number of bytes written. Zero is returned when the size of the input buffer is 0. On error, -1 is returned, and ``errno`` is set to indicate the error.\\n| * EBADF - not a valid file descriptor.\\n| * EBADMSG - The Ethernet type of the frame is different from the file descriptor configured filter.\\n| * EIO - Network interface not available or busy.\\n\\n``close()``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\nOpened ESP-NETIF L2 TAP file descriptor can be closed by the ``close()`` to free its allocated resources. The ESP-NETIF L2 TAP implementation of ``close()`` may block. On the other hand, it is thread-safe and can be called from a different task than the file descriptor is actually used. If such a situation occurs and one task is blocked in the I/O operation and another task tries to close the file descriptor, the first task is unblocked. The first\\'s task read operation then ends with an error.\\n\\n| On success, ``close()`` returns zero. On error, -1 is returned, and ``errno`` is set to indicate the error.\\n| * EBADF - not a valid file descriptor.\\n\\n``select()``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nSelect is used in a standard way, just :ref:`CONFIG_VFS_SUPPORT_SELECT` needs to be enabled to make the ``select()`` function available.\\n\\n\\n.. _esp_netif-sntp-api:\\n\\nSNTP API\\n--------\\n\\nYou can find a brief introduction to SNTP in general, its initialization code, and basic modes in Section :ref:`system-time-sntp-sync` in :doc:`System Time </api-reference/system/system_time>`.\\n\\nThis section provides more details about specific use cases of the SNTP service, with statically configured servers, or use the DHCP-provided servers, or both. The workflow is usually very simple:\\n\\n1) Initialize and configure the service using :cpp:func:`esp_netif_sntp_init()`. This operations can only be called once (unless the SNTP service has been destroyed by :cpp:func:`esp_netif_sntp_deinit()`)\\n2) Start the service via :cpp:func:`esp_netif_sntp_start()`. This step is not needed if we auto-started the service in the previous step (default). It is useful to start the service explicitly after connecting if we want to use the DHCP-obtained NTP servers. Please note, this option needs to be enabled before connecting, but the SNTP service should be started after.\\n3) Wait for the system time to synchronize using :cpp:func:`esp_netif_sntp_sync_wait()` (only if needed).\\n4) Stop and destroy the service using :cpp:func:`esp_netif_sntp_deinit()`.\\n\\n\\nBasic Mode with Statically Defined Server(s)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nInitialize the module with the default configuration after connecting to the network. Note that it is possible to provide multiple NTP servers in the configuration struct:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    esp_sntp_config_t config = ESP_NETIF_SNTP_DEFAULT_CONFIG_MULTIPLE(2,\\n                               ESP_SNTP_SERVER_LIST(\"time.windows.com\", \"pool.ntp.org\" ) );\\n    esp_netif_sntp_init(&config);\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    If we want to configure multiple SNTP servers, we have to update the lwIP configuration :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_SNTP_MAX_SERVERS`.\\n\\n\\nUse DHCP-Obtained SNTP Server(s)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFirst of all, we have to enable the lwIP configuration option :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_DHCP_GET_NTP_SRV`. Then we have to initialize the SNTP module with the DHCP option and without the NTP server:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    esp_sntp_config_t config = ESP_NETIF_SNTP_DEFAULT_CONFIG_MULTIPLE(0, {} );\\n    config.start = false;                       // start the SNTP service explicitly\\n    config.server_from_dhcp = true;             // accept the NTP offer from the DHCP server\\n    esp_netif_sntp_init(&config);\\n\\nThen, once we are connected, we could start the service using:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    esp_netif_sntp_start();\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    It is also possible to start the service during initialization (default ``config.start=true``). This would likely to cause the initial SNTP request to fail (since we are not connected yet) and lead to some back-off time for subsequent requests.\\n\\n\\nUse Both Static and Dynamic Servers\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nVery similar to the scenario above (DHCP provided SNTP server), but in this configuration, we need to make sure that the static server configuration is refreshed when obtaining NTP servers by DHCP. The underlying lwIP code cleans up the rest of the list of NTP servers when the DHCP-provided information gets accepted. Thus the ESP-NETIF SNTP module saves the statically configured server(s) and reconfigures them after obtaining a DHCP lease.\\n\\nThe typical configuration now looks as per below, providing the specific ``IP_EVENT`` to update the config and index of the first server to reconfigure (for example setting ``config.index_of_first_server=1`` would keep the DHCP provided server at index 0, and the statically configured server at index 1).\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    esp_sntp_config_t config = ESP_NETIF_SNTP_DEFAULT_CONFIG(\"pool.ntp.org\");\\n    config.start = false;                       // start the SNTP service explicitly (after connecting)\\n    config.server_from_dhcp = true;             // accept the NTP offers from DHCP server\\n    config.renew_servers_after_new_IP = true;   // let esp-netif update the configured SNTP server(s) after receiving the DHCP lease\\n    config.index_of_first_server = 1;           // updates from server num 1, leaving server 0 (from DHCP) intact\\n    config.ip_event_to_renew = IP_EVENT_STA_GOT_IP;  // IP event on which we refresh the configuration\\n\\nThen we start the service normally with  :cpp:func:`esp_netif_sntp_start()`.\\n\\n\\nESP-NETIF Programmer\\'s Manual\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nPlease refer to the following example to understand the initialization process of the default interface:\\n\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    - Wi-Fi Station: :example_file:`wifi/getting_started/station/main/station_example_main.c`\\n\\n- Ethernet: :example_file:`ethernet/basic/main/ethernet_example_main.c`\\n\\n- L2 TAP: :example_file:`protocols/l2tap/main/l2tap_main.c`\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_SOFTAP_SUPPORT\\n\\n    - Wi-Fi Access Point: :example_file:`wifi/getting_started/softAP/main/softap_example_main.c`\\n\\nFor more specific cases, please consult this guide: :doc:`/api-reference/network/esp_netif_driver`.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Wi-Fi Default Initialization\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The initialization code as well as registering event handlers for default interfaces, such as softAP and station, are provided in separate APIs to facilitate simple startup code for most applications:\\n\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_netif_create_default_wifi_sta()`\\n\\n    .. only:: CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_SOFTAP_SUPPORT\\n\\n        * :cpp:func:`esp_netif_create_default_wifi_ap()`\\n\\n    Please note that these functions return the ``esp_netif`` handle, i.e., a pointer to a network interface object allocated and configured with default settings, as a consequence, which means that:\\n\\n    * The created object has to be destroyed if a network de-initialization is provided by an application using :cpp:func:`esp_netif_destroy_default_wifi()`.\\n\\n    * These *default* interfaces must not be created multiple times unless the created handle is deleted using :cpp:func:`esp_netif_destroy()`.\\n\\n    .. only:: CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_SOFTAP_SUPPORT\\n\\n        * When using Wi-Fi in ``AP+STA`` mode, both these interfaces have to be created.\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_netif.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_netif_sntp.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_netif_types.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_netif_ip_addr.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_vfs_l2tap.inc\\n\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Wi-Fi Default API Reference\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    .. include-build-file:: inc/esp_wifi_default.inc\\n',\n",

       " \"ESP-NETIF Custom I/O Driver\\n===========================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThis section outlines implementing a new I/O driver with ESP-NETIF connection capabilities.\\n\\nBy convention, the I/O driver has to register itself as an ESP-NETIF driver, and thus holds a dependency on ESP-NETIF component and is responsible for providing data path functions, post-attach callback and in most cases, also default event handlers to define network interface actions based on driver's lifecycle transitions.\\n\\n\\nPacket Input/Output\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAccording to the diagram shown in the :ref:`esp-netif structure` part, the following three API functions for the packet data path must be defined for connecting with ESP-NETIF:\\n\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_netif_transmit()`\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_netif_free_rx_buffer()`\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_netif_receive()`\\n\\nThe first two functions for transmitting and freeing the rx buffer are provided as callbacks, i.e., they get called from ESP-NETIF (and its underlying TCP/IP stack) and I/O driver provides their implementation.\\n\\nThe receiving function on the other hand gets called from the I/O driver, so that the driver's code simply calls :cpp:func:`esp_netif_receive()` on a new data received event.\\n\\n\\nPost Attach Callback\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nA final part of the network interface initialization consists of attaching the ESP-NETIF instance to the I/O driver, by means of calling the following API:\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    esp_err_t esp_netif_attach(esp_netif_t *esp_netif, esp_netif_iodriver_handle driver_handle);\\n\\nIt is assumed that the ``esp_netif_iodriver_handle`` is a pointer to driver's object, a struct derived from ``struct esp_netif_driver_base_s``, so that the first member of I/O driver structure must be this base structure with pointers to:\\n\\n* post-attach function callback\\n* related ESP-NETIF instance\\n\\nAs a result, the I/O driver has to create an instance of the struct per below:\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    typedef struct my_netif_driver_s {\\n            esp_netif_driver_base_t base;           /*!< base structure reserved as esp-netif driver */\\n            driver_impl             *h;             /*!< handle of driver implementation */\\n        } my_netif_driver_t;\\n\\nwith actual values of ``my_netif_driver_t::base.post_attach`` and the actual drivers handle ``my_netif_driver_t::h``.\\n\\nSo when the :cpp:func:`esp_netif_attach()` gets called from the initialization code, the post-attach callback from I/O driver's code gets executed to mutually register callbacks between ESP-NETIF and I/O driver instances. Typically the driver is started as well in the post-attach callback. An example of a simple post-attach callback is outlined below:\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    static esp_err_t my_post_attach_start(esp_netif_t * esp_netif, void * args)\\n    {\\n        my_netif_driver_t *driver = args;\\n        const esp_netif_driver_ifconfig_t driver_ifconfig = {\\n                .driver_free_rx_buffer = my_free_rx_buf,\\n                .transmit = my_transmit,\\n                .handle = driver->driver_impl\\n        };\\n        driver->base.netif = esp_netif;\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_netif_set_driver_config(esp_netif, &driver_ifconfig));\\n        my_driver_start(driver->driver_impl);\\n        return ESP_OK;\\n    }\\n\\n\\nDefault Handlers\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nI/O drivers also typically provide default definitions of lifecycle behavior of related network interfaces based on state transitions of I/O drivers. For example *driver start* ``->`` *network start*, etc.\\n\\nAn example of such a default handler is provided below:\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    esp_err_t my_driver_netif_set_default_handlers(my_netif_driver_t *driver, esp_netif_t * esp_netif)\\n    {\\n        driver_set_event_handler(driver->driver_impl, esp_netif_action_start, MY_DRV_EVENT_START, esp_netif);\\n        driver_set_event_handler(driver->driver_impl, esp_netif_action_stop, MY_DRV_EVENT_STOP, esp_netif);\\n        return ESP_OK;\\n    }\\n\\n\\nNetwork Stack Connection\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe packet data path functions for transmitting and freeing the rx buffer (defined in the I/O driver) are called from the ESP-NETIF, specifically from its TCP/IP stack connecting layer.\\n\\nNote that ESP-IDF provides several network stack configurations for the most common network interfaces, such as for the Wi-Fi station or Ethernet. These configurations are defined in :component_file:`esp_netif/include/esp_netif_defaults.h` and should be sufficient for most network drivers. In rare cases, expert users might want to define custom lwIP based interface layers; it is possible, but an explicit dependency to lwIP needs to be set.\\n\\nThe following API reference outlines these network stack interaction with the ESP-NETIF:\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_netif_net_stack.inc\\n\",\n",

       " 'Wi-Fi Provisioning\\n==================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nThis component provides APIs that control the Wi-Fi provisioning service for receiving and configuring Wi-Fi credentials over SoftAP or Bluetooth LE transport via secure :doc:`protocomm` sessions. The set of ``wifi_prov_mgr_`` APIs help quickly implement a provisioning service that has necessary features with minimal amount of code and sufficient flexibility.\\n\\n.. _wifi-prov-mgr-init:\\n\\nInitialization\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n:cpp:func:`wifi_prov_mgr_init()` is called to configure and initialize the provisioning manager, and thus must be called prior to invoking any other ``wifi_prov_mgr_`` APIs. Note that the manager relies on other components of ESP-IDF, namely NVS, TCP/IP, Event Loop and Wi-Fi, and optionally mDNS, hence these components must be initialized beforehand. The manager can be de-initialized at any moment by making a call to :cpp:func:`wifi_prov_mgr_deinit()`.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        wifi_prov_mgr_config_t config = {\\n            .scheme = wifi_prov_scheme_ble,\\n            .scheme_event_handler = WIFI_PROV_SCHEME_BLE_EVENT_HANDLER_FREE_BTDM\\n        };\\n\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK( wifi_prov_mgr_init(config) );\\n\\n\\nThe configuration structure :cpp:type:`wifi_prov_mgr_config_t` has a few fields to specify the desired behavior of the manager:\\n\\n    * :cpp:member:`wifi_prov_mgr_config_t::scheme` - This is used to specify the provisioning scheme. Each scheme corresponds to one of the modes of transport supported by protocomm. Hence, support the following options:\\n\\n        * ``wifi_prov_scheme_ble`` - Bluetooth LE transport and GATT Server for handling the provisioning commands.\\n\\n        * ``wifi_prov_scheme_softap`` - Wi-Fi SoftAP transport and HTTP Server for handling the provisioning commands.\\n\\n        * ``wifi_prov_scheme_console`` - Serial transport and console for handling the provisioning commands.\\n\\n    * :cpp:member:`wifi_prov_mgr_config_t::scheme_event_handler`: An event handler defined along with the scheme. Choosing the appropriate scheme-specific event handler allows the manager to take care of certain matters automatically. Presently, this option is not used for either the SoftAP or Console-based provisioning, but is very convenient for Bluetooth LE. To understand how, we must recall that Bluetooth requires a substantial amount of memory to function, and once the provisioning is finished, the main application may want to reclaim back this memory (or part of it) if it needs to use either Bluetooth LE or classic Bluetooth. Also, upon every future reboot of a provisioned device, this reclamation of memory needs to be performed again. To reduce this complication in using ``wifi_prov_scheme_ble``, the scheme-specific handlers have been defined, and depending upon the chosen handler, the Bluetooth LE/classic Bluetooth/BTDM memory is freed automatically when the provisioning manager is de-initialized. The available options are:\\n\\n        * ``WIFI_PROV_SCHEME_BLE_EVENT_HANDLER_FREE_BTDM`` - Free both classic Bluetooth and Bluetooth LE/BTDM memory. Used when the main application does not require Bluetooth at all.\\n\\n        * ``WIFI_PROV_SCHEME_BLE_EVENT_HANDLER_FREE_BLE`` - Free only Bluetooth LE memory. Used when main application requires classic Bluetooth.\\n\\n        * ``WIFI_PROV_SCHEME_BLE_EVENT_HANDLER_FREE_BT`` - Free only classic Bluetooth. Used when main application requires Bluetooth LE. In this case freeing happens right when the manager is initialized.\\n\\n        * ``WIFI_PROV_EVENT_HANDLER_NONE`` - Do not use any scheme specific handler. Used when the provisioning scheme is not Bluetooth LE, i.e., using SoftAP or Console, or when main application wants to handle the memory reclaiming on its own, or needs both Bluetooth LE and classic Bluetooth to function.\\n\\n    * :cpp:member:`wifi_prov_mgr_config_t::app_event_handler` (Deprecated) - It is now recommended to catch ``WIFI_PROV_EVENT`` that is emitted to the default event loop handler. See definition of ``wifi_prov_cb_event_t`` for the list of events that are generated by the provisioning service.

In this case the ``pop`` is simply ignored.\\n\\nSee :doc:`provisioning` for details about the security features.\\n\\n    .. highlight:: c\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n        const char *service_name = \"my_device\";\\n        const char *service_key  = \"password\";\\n\\n        wifi_prov_security_t security = WIFI_PROV_SECURITY_1;\\n        const char *pop = \"abcd1234\";\\n\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK( wifi_prov_mgr_start_provisioning(security, pop, service_name, service_key) );\\n\\n\\nThe provisioning service automatically finishes only if it receives valid Wi-Fi AP credentials followed by successful connection of device to the AP with IP obtained. Regardless of that, the provisioning service can be stopped at any moment by making a call to :cpp:func:`wifi_prov_mgr_stop_provisioning()`.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    If the device fails to connect with the provided credentials, it does not accept new credentials anymore, but the provisioning service keeps on running, only to convey failure to the client, until the device is restarted. Upon restart, the provisioning state turns out to be true this time, as credentials are found in NVS, but the device does fail again to connect with those same credentials, unless an AP with the matching credentials somehow does become available. This situation can be fixed by resetting the credentials in NVS or force starting the provisioning service. This has been explained above in :ref:`wifi-prov-check-state`.\\n\\n\\nWaiting for Completion\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTypically, the main application waits for the provisioning to finish, then de-initializes the manager to free up resources, and finally starts executing its own logic.\\n\\nThere are two ways for making this possible. The simpler way is to use a blocking call to :cpp:func:`wifi_prov_mgr_wait()`.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        // Start provisioning service\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK( wifi_prov_mgr_start_provisioning(security, pop, service_name, service_key) );\\n\\n        // Wait for service to complete\\n        wifi_prov_mgr_wait();\\n\\n        // Finally de-initialize the manager\\n        wifi_prov_mgr_deinit();\\n\\n\\nThe other way is to use the default event loop handler to catch ``WIFI_PROV_EVENT`` and call :cpp:func:`wifi_prov_mgr_deinit()` when event ID is ``WIFI_PROV_END``:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        static void event_handler(void* arg, esp_event_base_t event_base,\\n                                  int event_id, void* event_data)\\n        {\\n            if (event_base == WIFI_PROV_EVENT && event_id == WIFI_PROV_END) {\\n                /* De-initialize the manager once the provisioning is finished */\\n                wifi_prov_mgr_deinit();\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n\\nUser Side Implementation\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen the service is started, the device to be provisioned is identified by the advertised service name, which, depending upon the selected transport, is either the Bluetooth LE device name or the SoftAP SSID.\\n\\nWhen using SoftAP transport, for allowing service discovery, mDNS must be initialized before starting provisioning. In this case, the host name set by the main application is used, and the service type is internally set to ``_esp_wifi_prov``.\\n\\nWhen using Bluetooth LE transport, a custom 128-bit UUID should be set using :cpp:func:`wifi_prov_scheme_ble_set_service_uuid()`. This UUID is to be included in the Bluetooth LE advertisement and corresponds to the primary GATT service that provides provisioning endpoints as GATT characteristics. Each GATT characteristic is formed using the primary service UUID as the base, with different auto-assigned 12th and 13th bytes, presumably counting from the 0th byte. Since an endpoint characteristic UUID is auto-assigned, it should not be used to identify the endpoint. Instead, client-side applications should identify the endpoints by reading the User Characteristic Description (``0x2901``) descriptor for each characteristic, which contains the endpoint name of the characteristic. For example, if the service UUID is set to ``55cc035e-fb27-4f80-be02-3c60828b7451``, each endpoint characteristic is assigned a UUID like ``55cc____-fb27-4f80-be02-3c60828b7451``, with unique values at the 12th and 13th bytes.\\n\\nOnce connected to the device, the provisioning-related protocomm endpoints can be identified as follows:\\n\\n.. |br| raw:: html\\n\\n    <br>\\n\\n.. list-table:: Endpoints Provided by the Provisioning Service\\n   :widths: 35 35 30\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n\\n   * - Endpoint Name |br| i.e., Bluetooth LE + GATT Server\\n     - URI, i.e., SoftAP |br| + HTTP Server + mDNS\\n     - Description\\n   * - prov-session\\n     - http://<mdns-hostname>.local/prov-session\\n     - Security endpoint used for session establishment\\n   * - prov-scan\\n     - http://wifi-prov.local/prov-scan\\n     - the endpoint used for starting Wi-Fi scan and receiving scan results\\n   * - prov-ctrl\\n     - http://wifi-prov.local/prov-ctrl\\n     - the endpoint used for controlling Wi-Fi provisioning state\\n   * - prov-config\\n     - http://<mdns-hostname>.local/prov-config\\n     - the endpoint used for configuring Wi-Fi credentials on device\\n   * - proto-ver\\n     - http://<mdns-hostname>.local/proto-ver\\n     - the endpoint for retrieving version info\\n\\nImmediately after connecting, the client application may fetch the version/capabilities information from the ``proto-ver`` endpoint. All communications to this endpoint are unencrypted, hence necessary information, which may be relevant for deciding compatibility, can be retrieved before establishing a secure session. The response is in JSON format and looks like : ``prov: { ver:  v1.1, cap:  [no_pop] }, my_app: { ver:  1.345, cap:  [cloud, local_ctrl] },....``. Here label ``prov`` provides provisioning service version ``ver`` and capabilities ``cap``. For now, only the ``no_pop`` capability is supported, which indicates that the service does not require proof of possession for authentication. Any application-related version or capabilities are given by other labels, e.g., ``my_app`` in this example. These additional fields are set using :cpp:func:`wifi_prov_mgr_set_app_info()`.\\n\\nUser side applications need to implement the signature handshaking required for establishing and authenticating secure protocomm sessions as per the security scheme configured for use, which is not needed when the manager is configured to use protocomm security 0.\\n\\nSee :doc:`provisioning` for more details about the secure handshake and encryption used. Applications must use the ``.proto`` files found under :component:`protocomm/proto`, which define the Protobuf message structures supported by ``prov-session`` endpoint.\\n\\nOnce a session is established, Wi-Fi credentials are configured using the following set of ``wifi_config`` commands, serialized as Protobuf messages with the corresponding ``.proto`` files that can be found under :component:`wifi_provisioning/proto`:\\n\\n    * ``get_status`` - For querying the Wi-Fi connection status. The device responds with a status which is one of connecting, connected or disconnected. If the status is disconnected, a disconnection reason is also to be included in the status response.\\n\\n    * ``set_config`` - For setting the Wi-Fi connection credentials.\\n\\n    * ``apply_config`` - For applying the credentials saved during ``set_config`` and starting the Wi-Fi station.\\n\\nAfter session establishment, the client can also request Wi-Fi scan results from the device. The results returned is a list of AP SSIDs, sorted in descending order of signal strength. This allows client applications to display APs nearby to the device at the time of provisioning, and users can select one of the SSIDs and provide the password which is then sent using the ``wifi_config`` commands described above. The ``wifi_scan`` endpoint supports the following protobuf commands :\\n\\n    * ``scan_start`` - For starting Wi-Fi scan with various options:\\n\\n        * ``blocking`` (input) - If true, the command returns only when the scanning is finished.\\n\\n        * ``passive`` (input) - If true, the scan is started in passive mode, which may be slower, instead of active mode.\\n\\n        * ``group_channels`` (input) - This specifies whether to scan all channels in one go when zero, or perform scanning of channels in groups, with 120 ms delay between scanning of consecutive groups, and the value of this parameter sets the number of channels in each group. This is useful when transport mode is SoftAP, where scanning all channels in one go may not give the Wi-Fi driver enough time to send out beacons, and hence may cause disconnection with any connected stations. When scanning in groups, the manager waits for at least 120 ms after completing the scan on a group of channels, and thus allows the driver to send out the beacons. For example, given that the total number of Wi-Fi channels is 14, then setting ``group_channels`` to 3 creates 5 groups, with each group having 3 channels, except the last one which has 14 % 3 = 2 channels. So, when the scan is started, the first 3 channels will be scanned, followed by a 120 ms delay, and then the next 3 channels, and so on, until all the 14 channels have been scanned.One may need to adjust this parameter as having only a few channels in a group may increase the overall scan time, while having too many may again cause disconnection. Usually, a value of 4 should work for most cases. Note that for any other mode of transport, e.g., Bluetooth LE, this can be safely set to 0, and hence achieve the shortest overall scanning time.\\n\\n        * ``period_ms`` (input) - The scan parameter specifying how long to wait on each channel.\\n\\n    * ``scan_status`` - It gives the status of scanning process:\\n\\n        * ``scan_finished`` (output) - When the scan has finished, this returns true.\\n\\n        * ``result_count`` (output) - This gives the total number of results obtained till now. If the scan is yet happening, this number keeps on updating.\\n\\n    * ``scan_result`` - For fetching the scan results. This can be called even if the scan is still on going.\\n\\n        * ``start_index`` (input) - Where the index starts from to fetch the entries from the results list.\\n\\n        * ``count`` (input) - The number of entries to fetch from the starting index.\\n\\n        * ``entries`` (output) - The list of entries returned. Each entry consists of ``ssid``, ``channel`` and ``rssi`` information.\\n\\nThe client can also control the provisioning state of the device using ``wifi_ctrl`` endpoint. The ``wifi_ctrl`` endpoint supports the following protobuf commands:\\n\\n    * ``ctrl_reset`` - Resets internal state machine of the device and clears provisioned credentials only in case of provisioning failures.\\n\\n    * ``ctrl_reprov`` - Resets internal state machine of the device and clears provisioned credentials only in case the device is to be provisioned again for new credentials after a previous successful provisioning.\\n\\nAdditional Endpoints\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn case users want to have some additional protocomm endpoints customized to their requirements, this is done in two steps. First is creation of an endpoint with a specific name, and the second step is the registration of a handler for this endpoint. See :doc:`protocomm` for the function signature of an endpoint handler. A custom endpoint must be created after initialization and before starting the provisioning service. Whereas, the protocomm handler is registered for this endpoint only after starting the provisioning service. Note that in the custom endpoint handler function, memory for the response of such protocomm endpoints should be allocated using heap as it gets freed by the protocomm layer once it has been sent by the transport layer.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        wifi_prov_mgr_init(config);\\n        wifi_prov_mgr_endpoint_create(\"custom-endpoint\");\\n        wifi_prov_mgr_start_provisioning(security, pop, service_name, service_key);\\n        wifi_prov_mgr_endpoint_register(\"custom-endpoint\", custom_ep_handler, custom_ep_data);\\n\\n\\nWhen the provisioning service stops, the endpoint is unregistered automatically.\\n\\nOne can also choose to call :cpp:func:`wifi_prov_mgr_endpoint_unregister()` to manually deactivate an endpoint at runtime. This can also be used to deactivate the internal endpoints used by the provisioning service.\\n\\nWhen/How to Stop the Provisioning Service?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe default behavior is that once the device successfully connects using the Wi-Fi credentials set by the ``apply_config`` command, the provisioning service stops, and Bluetooth LE or SoftAP turns off, automatically after responding to the next ``get_status`` command. If ``get_status`` command is not received by the device, the service stops after a 30 s timeout.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if device is not able to connect using the provided Wi-Fi credentials, due to incorrect SSID or passphrase, the service keeps running, and ``get_status`` keeps responding with disconnected status and reason for disconnection. Any further attempts to provide another set of Wi-Fi credentials, are to be rejected. These credentials are preserved, unless the provisioning service is force started, or NVS erased.\\n\\nIf this default behavior is not desired, it can be disabled by calling :cpp:func:`wifi_prov_mgr_disable_auto_stop()`. Now the provisioning service stops only after an explicit call to :cpp:func:`wifi_prov_mgr_stop_provisioning()`, which returns immediately after scheduling a task for stopping the service. The service stops after a certain delay and ``WIFI_PROV_END`` event gets emitted. This delay is specified by the argument to :cpp:func:`wifi_prov_mgr_disable_auto_stop()`.\\n\\nThe customized behavior is useful for applications which want the provisioning service to be stopped some time after the Wi-Fi connection is successfully established. For example, if the application requires the device to connect to some cloud service and obtain another set of credentials, and exchange these credentials over a custom protocomm endpoint, then after successfully doing so, stop the provisioning service by calling :cpp:func:`wifi_prov_mgr_stop_provisioning()` inside the protocomm handler itself. The right amount of delay ensures that the transport resources are freed only after the response from the protocomm handler reaches the client side application.\\n\\nApplication Examples\\n--------------------\\n\\nFor complete example implementation see :example:`provisioning/wifi_prov_mgr`.\\n\\nProvisioning Tools\\n--------------------\\n\\nProvisioning applications are available for various platforms, along with source code:\\n\\n* Android:\\n    * `Bluetooth LE Provisioning app on Play Store <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.espressif.provble>`_.\\n    * `SoftAP Provisioning app on Play Store <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.espressif.provsoftap>`_.\\n    * Source code on GitHub: `esp-idf-provisioning-android <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf-provisioning-android>`_.\\n* iOS:\\n    * `Bluetooth LE Provisioning app on App Store <https://apps.apple.com/in/app/esp-ble-provisioning/id1473590141>`_.\\n    * `SoftAP Provisioning app on App Store <https://apps.apple.com/in/app/esp-softap-provisioning/id1474040630>`_.\\n    * Source code on GitHub: `esp-idf-provisioning-ios <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf-provisioning-ios>`_.\\n* Linux/MacOS/Windows: :idf:`tools/esp_prov`, a Python-based command-line tool for provisioning.\\n\\nThe phone applications offer simple UI and are thus more user centric, while the command-line application is useful as a debugging tool for developers.\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/manager.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/scheme_ble.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/scheme_softap.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/scheme_console.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/wifi_config.inc\\n',\n",

Users can choose to implement their own security (even without using protobuf). Protocomm can also be used without any security layer.\\n\\nProtocomm provides the framework for various transports:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    :SOC_BLE_SUPPORTED: - Bluetooth LE\\n    :SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED: - Wi-Fi (SoftAP + HTTPD)\\n    - Console, in which case the handler invocation is automatically taken care of on the device side.

       " 'Unified Provisioning\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n>>>>>>>>\\n\\nThe unified provisioning support in the ESP-IDF provides an extensible mechanism to the developers to configure the device with the Wi-Fi credentials and/or other custom configuration using various transports and different security schemes. Depending on the use case, it provides a complete and ready solution for Wi-Fi network provisioning along with example iOS and Android applications. The developers can choose to extend the device-side and phone-app side implementations to accommodate their requirements for sending additional configuration data. The followings are the important features of this implementation:\\n\\n1. **Extensible Protocol**\\n\\nThe protocol is completely flexible and it offers the ability for the developers to send custom configuration in the provisioning process. The data representation is also left to the application to decide.\\n\\n2. **Transport Flexibility**\\n\\nThe protocol can work on Wi-Fi (SoftAP + HTTP server) or on Bluetooth LE as a transport protocol. The framework provides an ability to add support for any other transport easily as long as command-response behavior can be supported on the transport.\\n\\n3. **Security Scheme Flexibility**\\n\\nIt is understood that each use case may require different security scheme to secure the data that is exchanged in the provisioning process. Some applications may work with SoftAP that is WPA2 protected or Bluetooth LE with the \"just-works\" security. Or the applications may consider the transport to be insecure and may want application-level security. The unified provisioning framework allows the application to choose the security as deemed suitable.\\n\\n4. **Compact Data Representation**\\n\\nThe protocol uses `Google Protobufs <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/>`_ as a data representation for session setup and Wi-Fi provisioning. They provide a compact data representation and ability to parse the data in multiple programming languages in native format.

The following points need to be considered while selecting the best possible transport for provisioning:\\n\\n1. The Bluetooth LE-based transport has the advantage of maintaining an intact communication channel between the device and the client during the provisioning, which ensures reliable provisioning feedback.\\n2. The Bluetooth LE-based provisioning implementation makes the user experience better from the phone apps as on Android and iOS both, the phone app can discover and connect to the device without requiring the user to go out of the phone app.\\n3. However, the Bluetooth LE transport consumes about 110 KB memory at runtime. If the product does not use the Bluetooth LE or Bluetooth functionality after provisioning is done, almost all the memory can be reclaimed and added into the heap.\\n4. The SoftAP-based transport is highly interoperable. However, there are a few considerations:\\n\\n    - The device uses the same radio to host the SoftAP and also to connect to the configured AP. Since these could potentially be on different channels, it may cause connection status updates not to be reliably received by the phone\\n\\n    - The phone (client) has to disconnect from its current AP in order to connect to the SoftAP. The original network will get restored only when the provisioning process is complete, and the softAP is taken down.\\n\\n5. The SoftAP transport does not require much additional memory for the Wi-Fi use cases.\\n6. The SoftAP-based provisioning requires the phone-app user to go to ``System Settings`` to connect to the Wi-Fi network hosted by the device in the iOS system. The discovery (scanning) as well as connection APIs are not available for the iOS applications.\\n\\nDeciding on Security\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\n\\nDepending on the transport and other constraints, the security scheme needs to be selected by the application developers. The following considerations need to be given from the provisioning-security perspective:\\n\\n1. The configuration data sent from the client to the device and the response have to be secured.\\n2. The client should authenticate the device that it is connected to.\\n3. The device manufacturer may choose proof-of-possession (PoP), a unique per-device secret to be entered on the provisioning client as a security measure to make sure that only the user can provision the device in their possession.\\n\\nThere are two levels of security schemes, of which the developer may select one or a combination, depending on requirements.\\n\\n1. **Transport Security**\\n\\nFor SoftAP provisioning, developers may choose WPA2-protected security with unique per-device passphrase. Unique per-device passphrase can also act as a proof-of-possession. For Bluetooth LE, the \"just-works\" security can be used as a transport-level security after assessing its provided level of security.\\n\\n2. **Application Security**\\n\\nThe unified provisioning subsystem provides the application-level security (`Security 1 Scheme`_) that provides data protection and authentication through PoP, if the application does not use the transport-level security, or if the transport-level security is not sufficient for the use case.\\n\\nDevice Discovery\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\n\\nThe advertisement and device discovery is left to the application and depending on the protocol chosen, the phone apps and device-firmware application can choose appropriate method for advertisement and discovery.\\n\\nFor the SoftAP+HTTP transport, typically the SSID (network name) of the AP hosted by the device can be used for discovery.\\n\\nFor the Bluetooth LE transport, device name or primary service included in the advertisement or a combination of both can be used for discovery.\\n\\nArchitecture\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>\\n\\nThe below diagram shows the architecture of unified provisioning:\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/unified_provisioning.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Unified Provisioning Architecture\\n\\n    Unified Provisioning Architecture\\n\\nIt relies on the base layer called :doc:`protocomm` (protocomm) which provides a framework for security schemes and transport mechanisms. The Wi-Fi Provisioning layer uses protocomm to provide simple callbacks to the application for setting the configuration and getting the Wi-Fi status. The application has control over implementation of these callbacks. In addition, the application can directly use protocomm to register custom handlers.\\n\\nThe application creates a protocomm instance which is mapped to a specific transport and specific security scheme. Each transport in the protocomm has a concept of an \"end-point\" which corresponds to the logical channel for communication for specific type of information. For example, security handshake happens on a different endpoint from the Wi-Fi configuration endpoint. Each end-point is identified using a string and depending on the transport internal representation of the end-point changes. In case of the SoftAP+HTTP transport, the end-point corresponds to URI, whereas in case of Bluetooth LE, the end-point corresponds to the GATT characteristic with specific UUID. Developers can create custom end-points and implement handler for the data that is received or sent over the same end-point.\\n\\n.. _provisioning_security_schemes:\\n\\nSecurity Schemes\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\n\\nAt present, the unified provisioning supports the following security schemes:\\n\\n1. Security 0\\n\\nNo security (No encryption).\\n\\n2. Security 1\\n\\nCurve25519-based key exchange, shared key derivation and AES256-CTR mode encryption of the data. It supports two modes :\\n\\n    a. Authorized - Proof of Possession (PoP) string used to authorize session and derive shared key.\\n\\n    b. No Auth (Null PoP) - Shared key derived through key exchange only.\\n\\n3. Security 2\\n\\nSRP6a-based shared key derivation and AES256-GCM mode encryption of the data.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The respective security schemes need to be enabled through the project configuration menu.

       " \"SD/SDIO/MMC Driver\\n==================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nThe SD/SDIO/MMC driver currently supports SD memory, SDIO cards, and eMMC chips. This is a protocol layer driver (:component_file:`sdmmc/include/sdmmc_cmd.h`) which can be implemented by:\\n\\n.. list::\\n    :SOC_SDMMC_HOST_SUPPORTED: - SDMMC host driver (:component_file:`esp_driver_sdmmc/include/driver/sdmmc_host.h`), see :doc:`SDMMC Host API <../peripherals/sdmmc_host>` for more details.\\n    - SDSPI host driver (:component_file:`esp_driver_sdspi/include/driver/sdspi_host.h`), see :doc:`SD SPI Host API <../peripherals/sdspi_host>` for more details.\\n\\nProtocol Layer vs Host Layer\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe SDMMC protocol layer described in this document handles the specifics of the SD protocol, such as the card initialization flow and variours data transfer command flows. The protocol layer works with the host via the :cpp:class:`sdmmc_host_t` structure. This structure contains pointers to various functions of the host.\\n\\nHost layer driver(s) implement the protocol layer driver by supporting these functions:\\n\\n- Sending commands to slave devices\\n- Sending and receiving data\\n- Handling error conditions within the bus\\n\\n.. blockdiag:: /../_static/diagrams/sd/sd_arch.diag\\n    :scale: 100%\\n    :caption: SD Host Side Component Architecture\\n    :align: center\\n\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\nAn example which combines the SDMMC driver with the FATFS library is provided in the :example:`storage/sd_card` directory of ESP-IDF examples. This example initializes the card, then writes and reads data from it using POSIX and C library APIs. See README.md file in the example directory for more information.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SDMMC_HOST_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Protocol Layer API\\n    ------------------\\n\\n    The protocol layer is given the :cpp:class:`sdmmc_host_t` structure. This structure describes the SD/MMC host driver, lists its capabilities, and provides pointers to functions for the implementation driver. The protocol layer stores card-specific information in the :cpp:class:`sdmmc_card_t` structure. When sending commands to the SD/MMC host driver, the protocol layer uses the :cpp:class:`sdmmc_command_t` structure to describe the command, arguments, expected return values, and data to transfer if there is any.\\n\\n\\n    Using API with SD Memory Cards\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    1. To initialize the host, call the host driver functions, e.g., :cpp:func:`sdmmc_host_init`, :cpp:func:`sdmmc_host_init_slot`.\\n    2. To initialize the card, call :cpp:func:`sdmmc_card_init` and pass to it the parameters ``host`` - the host driver information, and ``card`` - a pointer to the structure :cpp:class:`sdmmc_card_t` which will be filled with information about the card when the function completes.\\n    3. To read and write sectors of the card, use :cpp:func:`sdmmc_read_sectors` and :cpp:func:`sdmmc_write_sectors` respectively and pass to it the parameter ``card`` - a pointer to the card information structure.\\n    4. If the card is not used anymore, call the host driver function - e.g., :cpp:func:`sdmmc_host_deinit` - to disable the host peripheral and free the resources allocated by the driver.\\n\\n\\n    Using API with eMMC Chips\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    From the protocol layer's perspective, eMMC memory chips behave exactly like SD memory cards. Even though eMMCs are chips and do not have a card form factor, the terminology for SD cards can still be applied to eMMC due to the similarity of the protocol (`sdmmc_card_t`, `sdmmc_card_init`). Note that eMMC chips cannot be used over SPI, which makes them incompatible with the SD SPI host driver.\\n\\n    To initialize eMMC memory and perform read/write operations, follow the steps listed for SD cards in the previous section.\\n\\n\\n    Using API with SDIO Cards\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Initialization and the probing process are the same as with SD memory cards. The only difference is in data transfer commands in SDIO mode.\\n\\n    During the card initialization and probing, performed with :cpp:func:`sdmmc_card_init`, the driver only configures the following registers of the IO card:\\n\\n    1. The IO portion of the card is reset by setting RES bit in the I/O Abort (0x06) register.\\n    2. If 4-line mode is enabled in host and slot configuration, the driver attempts to set the Bus width field in the Bus Interface Control (0x07) register. If setting the filed is successful, which means that the slave supports 4-line mode, the host is also switched to 4-line mode.\\n    3. If high-speed mode is enabled in the host configuration, the SHS bit is set in the High Speed (0x13) register.\\n\\n    In particular, the driver does not set any bits in (1) I/O Enable and Int Enable registers, (2) I/O block sizes, etc. Applications can set them by calling :cpp:func:`sdmmc_io_write_byte`.\\n\\n    For card configuration and data transfer, choose the pair of functions relevant to your case from the table below.\\n\\n    .. list-table::\\n       :widths: 55 25 20\\n       :header-rows: 1\\n\\n       * - Action\\n         - Read Function\\n         - Write Function\\n       * - Read and write a single byte using IO_RW_DIRECT (CMD52)\\n         - :cpp:func:`sdmmc_io_read_byte`\\n         - :cpp:func:`sdmmc_io_write_byte`\\n       * - Read and write multiple bytes using IO_RW_EXTENDED (CMD53) in byte mode\\n         - :cpp:func:`sdmmc_io_read_bytes`\\n         - :cpp:func:`sdmmc_io_write_bytes`\\n       * - Read and write blocks of data using IO_RW_EXTENDED (CMD53) in block mode\\n         - :cpp:func:`sdmmc_io_read_blocks`\\n         - :cpp:func:`sdmmc_io_write_blocks`\\n\\n    SDIO interrupts can be enabled by the application using the function :cpp:func:`sdmmc_io_enable_int`. When using SDIO in 1-line mode, the D1 line also needs to be connected to use SDIO interrupts.\\n\\n    If you want the application to wait until the SDIO interrupt occurs, use :cpp:func:`sdmmc_io_wait_int`.\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32\\n\\n        There is a component ESSL (ESP Serial Slave Link) to use if you are communicating with an ESP32 SDIO slave. See :doc:`/api-reference/protocols/esp_serial_slave_link` and example :example:`peripherals/sdio/host`.\\n\\nCombo (Memory + IO) Cards\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe driver does not support SD combo cards. Combo cards are treated as IO cards.\\n\\n\\nThread Safety\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nMost applications need to use the protocol layer only in one task. For this reason, the protocol layer does not implement any kind of locking on the :cpp:class:`sdmmc_card_t` structure, or when accessing SDMMC or SD SPI host drivers. Such locking is usually implemented on a higher layer, e.g., in the filesystem driver.\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/sdmmc_cmd.inc\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/sdmmc_types.inc\\n\",\n",

       " 'Virtual Filesystem Component\\n============================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nVirtual filesystem (VFS) component provides a unified interface for drivers which can perform operations on file-like objects. These can be real filesystems (FAT, SPIFFS, etc.) or device drivers which provide a file-like interface.\\n\\nThis component allows C library functions, such as fopen and fprintf, to work with FS drivers. At a high level, each FS driver is associated with some path prefix. When one of C library functions needs to open a file, the VFS component searches for the FS driver associated with the file path and forwards the call to that driver. VFS also forwards read, write, and other calls for the given file to the same FS driver.\\n\\nFor example, one can register a FAT filesystem driver with the ``/fat`` prefix and call ``fopen(\"/fat/file.txt\", \"w\")``. Then the VFS component calls the function ``open`` of the FAT driver and pass the argument ``/file.txt`` to it together with appropriate mode flags. All subsequent calls to C library functions for the returned ``FILE*`` stream will also be forwarded to the FAT driver.\\n\\n\\nFS Registration\\n---------------\\n\\nTo register an FS driver, an application needs to define an instance of the :cpp:type:`esp_vfs_t` structure and populate it with function pointers to FS APIs:\\n\\n.. highlight:: c\\n\\n::\\n\\n    esp_vfs_t myfs = {\\n        .flags = ESP_VFS_FLAG_DEFAULT,\\n        .write = &myfs_write,\\n        .open = &myfs_open,\\n        .fstat = &myfs_fstat,\\n        .close = &myfs_close,\\n        .read = &myfs_read,\\n    };\\n\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_vfs_register(\"/data\", &myfs, NULL));\\n\\nDepending on the way how the FS driver declares its API functions, either ``read``, ``write``, etc., or ``read_p``, ``write_p``, etc., should be used.\\n\\nCase 1: API functions are declared without an extra context pointer (the FS driver is a singleton)::\\n\\n    ssize_t myfs_write(int fd, const void * data, size_t size);\\n\\n    // In definition of esp_vfs_t:\\n        .flags = ESP_VFS_FLAG_DEFAULT,\\n        .write = &myfs_write,\\n    // ... other members initialized\\n\\n    // When registering FS, context pointer (third argument) is NULL:\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_vfs_register(\"/data\", &myfs, NULL));\\n\\nCase 2: API functions are declared with an extra context pointer (the FS driver supports multiple instances)::\\n\\n    ssize_t myfs_write(myfs_t* fs, int fd, const void * data, size_t size);\\n\\n    // In definition of esp_vfs_t:\\n        .flags = ESP_VFS_FLAG_CONTEXT_PTR,\\n        .write_p = &myfs_write,\\n    // ... other members initialized\\n\\n    // When registering FS, pass the FS context pointer into the third argument\\n    // (hypothetical myfs_mount function is used for illustrative purposes)\\n    myfs_t* myfs_inst1 = myfs_mount(partition1->offset, partition1->size);\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_vfs_register(\"/data1\", &myfs, myfs_inst1));\\n\\n    // Can register another instance:\\n    myfs_t* myfs_inst2 = myfs_mount(partition2->offset, partition2->size);\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_vfs_register(\"/data2\", &myfs, myfs_inst2));\\n\\nSynchronous Input/Output Multiplexing\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSynchronous input/output multiplexing by :cpp:func:`select` is supported in the VFS component. The implementation works in the following way.\\n\\n1. :cpp:func:`select` is called with file descriptors which could belong to various VFS drivers.\\n\\n2. The file descriptors are divided into groups each belonging to one VFS driver.\\n\\n3. The file descriptors belonging to non-socket VFS drivers are handed over to the given VFS drivers by :cpp:func:`start_select`, described later on this page. This function represents the driver-specific implementation of :cpp:func:`select` for the given driver. This should be a non-blocking call which means the function should immediately return after setting up the environment for checking events related to the given file descriptors.\\n\\n4. The file descriptors belonging to the socket VFS driver are handed over to the socket driver by :cpp:func:`socket_select` described later on this page. This is a blocking call which means that it will return only if there is an event related to socket file descriptors or a non-socket driver signals :cpp:func:`socket_select` to exit.\\n\\n5. Results are collected from each VFS driver and all drivers are stopped by de-initialization of the environment for checking events.\\n\\n6. The :cpp:func:`select` call ends and returns the appropriate results.\\n\\nNon-Socket VFS Drivers\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nIf you want to use :cpp:func:`select` with a file descriptor belonging to a non-socket VFS driver, then you need to register the driver with functions :cpp:func:`start_select` and :cpp:func:`end_select` similarly to the following example:\\n\\n.. highlight:: c\\n\\n::\\n\\n    // In definition of esp_vfs_t:\\n        .start_select = &uart_start_select,\\n        .end_select = &uart_end_select,\\n    // ... other members initialized\\n\\n:cpp:func:`start_select` is called for setting up the environment for detection of read/write/error conditions on file descriptors belonging to the given VFS driver.\\n\\n:cpp:func:`end_select` is called to stop/deinitialize/free the environment which was setup by :cpp:func:`start_select`.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    :cpp:func:`end_select` might be called without a previous :cpp:func:`start_select` call in some rare circumstances. :cpp:func:`end_select` should fail gracefully if this is the case (i.e., should not crash but return an error instead).\\n\\nPlease refer to the reference implementation for the UART peripheral in :component_file:`esp_driver_uart/src/uart_vfs.c` and most particularly to the functions :cpp:func:`uart_vfs_dev_register`, :cpp:func:`uart_start_select`, and :cpp:func:`uart_end_select` for more information.\\n\\nPlease check the following examples that demonstrate the use of :cpp:func:`select` with VFS file descriptors:\\n\\n- :example:`peripherals/uart/uart_select`\\n- :example:`system/select`\\n\\n\\nSocket VFS Drivers\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nA socket VFS driver is using its own internal implementation of :cpp:func:`select` and non-socket VFS drivers notify it upon read/write/error conditions.\\n\\nA socket VFS driver needs to be registered with the following functions defined:\\n\\n.. highlight:: c\\n\\n::\\n\\n    // In definition of esp_vfs_t:\\n        .socket_select = &lwip_select,\\n        .get_socket_select_semaphore = &lwip_get_socket_select_semaphore,\\n        .stop_socket_select = &lwip_stop_socket_select,\\n        .stop_socket_select_isr = &lwip_stop_socket_select_isr,\\n    // ... other members initialized\\n\\n:cpp:func:`socket_select` is the internal implementation of :cpp:func:`select` for the socket driver. It works only with file descriptors belonging to the socket VFS.\\n\\n:cpp:func:`get_socket_select_semaphore` returns the signalization object (semaphore) which is used in non-socket drivers to stop the waiting in :cpp:func:`socket_select`.\\n\\n:cpp:func:`stop_socket_select` call is used to stop the waiting in :cpp:func:`socket_select` by passing the object returned by :cpp:func:`get_socket_select_semaphore`.\\n\\n:cpp:func:`stop_socket_select_isr` has the same functionality as :cpp:func:`stop_socket_select` but it can be used from ISR.\\n\\nPlease see :component_file:`lwip/port/esp32xx/vfs_lwip.c` for a reference socket driver implementation using LWIP.\\n\\n.. note::\\n    If you use :cpp:func:`select` for socket file descriptors only then you can disable the :ref:`CONFIG_VFS_SUPPORT_SELECT` option to reduce the code size and improve performance.\\n    You should not change the socket driver during an active :cpp:func:`select` call or you might experience some undefined behavior.\\n\\nPaths\\n-----\\n\\nEach registered FS has a path prefix associated with it. This prefix can be considered as a \"mount point\" of this partition.\\n\\nIn case when mount points are nested, the mount point with the longest matching path prefix is used when opening the file. For instance, suppose that the following filesystems are registered in VFS:\\n\\n- FS 1 on /data\\n- FS 2 on /data/static\\n\\nThen:\\n\\n- FS 1 will be used when opening a file called ``/data/log.txt``\\n- FS 2 will be used when opening a file called ``/data/static/index.html``\\n- Even if ``/index.html\"`` does not exist in FS 2, FS 1 will **not** be searched for ``/static/index.html``.\\n\\nAs a general rule, mount point names must start with the path separator (``/``) and must contain at least one character after path separator. However, an empty mount point name is also supported and might be used in cases when an application needs to provide a \"fallback\" filesystem or to override VFS functionality altogether. Such filesystem will be used if no prefix matches the path given.\\n\\nVFS does not handle dots (``.``) in path names in any special way. VFS does not treat ``..`` as a reference to the parent directory. In the above example, using a path ``/data/static/../log.txt`` will not result in a call to FS 1 to open ``/log.txt``. Specific FS drivers (such as FATFS) might handle dots in file names differently.\\n\\nWhen opening files, the FS driver receives only relative paths to files. For example:\\n\\n1. The ``myfs`` driver is registered with ``/data`` as a path prefix.\\n2. The application calls ``fopen(\"/data/config.json\", ...)``.\\n3. The VFS component calls ``myfs_open(\"/config.json\", ...)``.\\n4. The ``myfs`` driver opens the ``/config.json`` file.\\n\\nVFS does not impose any limit on total file path length, but it does limit the FS path prefix to ``ESP_VFS_PATH_MAX`` characters. Individual FS drivers may have their own filename length limitations.\\n\\n\\nFile Descriptors\\n----------------\\n\\nFile descriptors are small positive integers from ``0`` to ``FD_SETSIZE - 1``, where ``FD_SETSIZE`` is defined in ``sys/select.h``. The largest file descriptors (configured by ``CONFIG_LWIP_MAX_SOCKETS``) are reserved for sockets. The VFS component contains a lookup-table called ``s_fd_table`` for mapping global file descriptors to VFS driver indexes registered in the ``s_vfs`` array.\\n\\n\\nStandard IO Streams (``stdin``, ``stdout``, ``stderr``)\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIf the menuconfig option ``UART for console output`` is not set to ``None``, then ``stdin``, ``stdout``, and ``stderr`` are configured to read from, and write to, a UART. It is possible to use UART0 or UART1 for standard IO. By default, UART0 is used with 115200 baud rate; TX pin is GPIO1; RX pin is GPIO3. These parameters can be changed in menuconfig.\\n\\nWriting to ``stdout`` or ``stderr`` sends characters to the UART transmit FIFO. Reading from ``stdin`` retrieves characters from the UART receive FIFO.\\n\\nBy default, VFS uses simple functions for reading from and writing to UART. Writes busy-wait until all data is put into UART FIFO, and reads are non-blocking, returning only the data present in the FIFO. Due to this non-blocking read behavior, higher level C library calls, such as ``fscanf(\"%d\\\\n\", &var);``, might not have desired results.\\n\\nApplications which use the UART driver can instruct VFS to use the driver\\'s interrupt driven, blocking read and write functions instead. This can be done using a call to the :cpp:func:`uart_vfs_dev_use_driver` function. It is also possible to revert to the basic non-blocking functions using a call to :cpp:func:`uart_vfs_dev_use_nonblocking`.\\n\\nVFS also provides an optional newline conversion feature for input and output. Internally, most applications send and receive lines terminated by the LF (\\'\\'\\\\n\\'\\') character. Different terminal programs may require different line termination, such as CR or CRLF. Applications can configure this separately for input and output either via menuconfig, or by calls to the functions :cpp:func:`uart_vfs_dev_port_set_rx_line_endings` and :cpp:func:`uart_vfs_dev_port_set_tx_line_endings`.\\n\\n\\nStandard Streams and FreeRTOS Tasks\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n``FILE`` objects for ``stdin``, ``stdout``, and ``stderr`` are shared between all FreeRTOS tasks, but the pointers to these objects are stored in per-task ``struct _reent``.\\n\\nThe following code is transferred to ``fprintf(__getreent()->_stderr, \"42\\\\n\");`` by the preprocessor:\\n\\n.. highlight:: c\\n\\n::\\n\\n    fprintf(stderr, \"42\\\\n\");\\n\\n\\nThe ``__getreent()`` function returns a per-task pointer to ``struct _reent`` in newlib libc. This structure is allocated on the TCB of each task. When a task is initialized, ``_stdin``, ``_stdout``, and ``_stderr`` members of ``struct _reent`` are set to the values of ``_stdin``, ``_stdout``, and ``_stderr`` of ``_GLOBAL_REENT`` (i.e., the structure which is used before FreeRTOS is started).\\n\\nSuch a design has the following consequences:\\n\\n- It is possible to set ``stdin``, ``stdout``, and ``stderr`` for any given task without affecting other tasks, e.g., by doing ``stdin = fopen(\"/dev/uart/1\", \"r\")``.\\n- Closing default ``stdin``, ``stdout``, or ``stderr`` using ``fclose`` closes the ``FILE`` stream object, which will affect all other tasks.\\n- To change the default ``stdin``, ``stdout``, ``stderr`` streams for new tasks, modify ``_GLOBAL_REENT->_stdin`` (``_stdout``, ``_stderr``) before creating the task.\\n\\n``eventfd()``\\n-------------\\n\\n``eventfd()`` call is a powerful tool to notify a ``select()`` based loop of custom events. The ``eventfd()`` implementation in ESP-IDF is generally the same as described in `man(2) eventfd <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/eventfd.2.html>`_ except for:\\n\\n- ``esp_vfs_eventfd_register()`` has to be called before calling ``eventfd()``\\n- Options ``EFD_CLOEXEC``, ``EFD_NONBLOCK`` and ``EFD_SEMAPHORE`` are not supported in flags.\\n- Option ``EFD_SUPPORT_ISR`` has been added in flags. This flag is required to read and write the eventfd in an interrupt handler.\\n\\nNote that creating an eventfd with ``EFD_SUPPORT_ISR`` will cause interrupts to be temporarily disabled when reading, writing the file and during the beginning and the ending of the ``select()`` when this file is set.\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_vfs.inc\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_vfs_dev.inc\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/uart_vfs.inc\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_vfs_eventfd.inc\\n',\n",

If you are interested in using these tools, please refer to the user guide at :ref:`fatfs-partition-generator`.\\n\\nThe FAT file system is composed of various logical units. The units are used to store general information about the file system, allocations, content of files and directories, and file\\'s metadata. The tools ``fatfsgen.py`` and ``fatfsparse.py`` are used to implement the FAT file system while considering all these logical units, and they also provide support for wear levelling.\\n\\n\\nFAT File System Generator and Parser Design\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis section describes particular units of the FAT file system generator and parser design. The implementation aims to create a valid model of the FAT structure with a focus on macro operations, generating and parsing the whole partition without modifying it in the run (mounting).\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/classes_fatfsgen.svg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Class diagram\\n\\n    FAT File System Generator and Parser Design Architecture\\n\\n\\nClass FATFS\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThis is the most general entity responsible for modeling the FAT file system. It is composed of **FATFSState** (holding metadata and boot sector), **FAT** (holding file allocation table), and **Directory** (representing the root directory required by FAT12 and FAT16). The class processes all the requirements for the partition, analyses the local folder dedicated to transforming it into a binary image, and generates an internal representation of the local folder. Then, the class can generate a binary image from the internal FAT file system model.\\n\\nClass WLFATFS\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe class extends the functionality of the class **FATFS**. It implements an encapsulation of the file system into the wear levelling, by adding the \"dummy\" sector for balancing the load (a redundant sector, see the section :ref:`fafsgen-wear-levelling`), configuration sector and state sector. This class generates a binary FATFS partition with initialized wear levelling layer. For further analysis, it also provides an option to remove the wear levelling completely. The class is instantiated and invoked by the ``wl_fatfsgen.py`` script.\\n\\nClass BootSectorState\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe instance of this class contains the metadata required for building a boot sector and BPB (BIOS Parameter Block). Boot sector is basically implemented for the cross-platform compatibility, i.e., when ESP chipsets are connected with other platforms, it will always follow all the FAT file system standards. However, during partition generation, chip does not consume the data in this boot sector and all the other data needed, as the data is constant. In other words, changing the fields with the prefix \"BS\" is usually unnecessary and often does not work. If you want to add new features, please focus on fields with the prefix \"BPB\". Another critical role of this class is to share access to the metadata and binary image over the whole class system. Because of this, every class in the system can access this singleton.\\n\\nClass FATFSState\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe class **FATFSState** might be obsolete in the future, so developers could transfer its functionality into the **BootSectorState**. The class contains a reference to the **BootSectorState** and extends the data with some unknown information when creating a boot sector or unnecessary for the boot sector, such as the information generated when the file system supports long file names.\\n\\nClass FAT\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFAT represents the File Allocation Table. FAT is a sequence of bytes spread over one or more sectors. The number of sectors is determined by the number of clusters and is calculated by the function ``get_fat_sectors_count`` in ``utils.py``. The aim is to have as few sectors for one FAT as possible when you refer to every physical cluster in the file system. The FAT works as follows: For every physical cluster at ``i * some_constant`` address, FAT contains an entry at the ``i``-th location which represents next address of the clusters in the file chain. Each version of the FAT file system uses a different size for FAT entries. FAT12 uses 12 bits per entry, thus 2 entries span 3 bytes. FAT16 uses 16 bits per entry, thus 1 entry spans 2 bytes. FAT32 uses 32 bits per FAT entry, thus one entry spans 4 bytes. All entries are in little-endian byte order.\\n\\nAll zeros at the ``i``-th entry indicates that corresponding cluster is free, while all ones at the ``i``-th entry indicates that corresponding cluster is occupied and is the last cluster in the file chain. The other number at ``ith``-th entry determines the next cluster\\'s address in the file chain. These clusters are not necessarily stored adjacent to one another in the memory but instead are often fragmented throughout the data region.\\n\\nFor partition generation, the file is divided into several parts to fit the cluster. Notice that the structure allocation of the files is a linked list. Every cluster in the file allocation chain has entry in the FAT which refers to the next cluster or the information about the last cluster in the file chain. As mentioned, FAT12 uses 12 bits per FAT entry, thus it can sets a maximum number of 4096 clusters, as with 12 bits (one and a half bytes), it can enumerate 4096 clusters at most. However, because of other overhead, FAT12 can have 4085 clusters at most. Similarly, FAT16 can have 65525 clusters at most and for FAT32 can have 268435445 clusters at most (as practically only 28 bits out of 32 bits are used to denote each FAT entry). The current implementation doesn\\'t allow forcibly redefining the FAT file system with less than 4085 clusters to FAT16, even though the documentation claims it is possible. Notice that it would be meaningless to define it vice versa, i.e., to FAT12 with more than 4085 clusters (which implies clusters on higher addresses being inaccessible).\\n\\nClass Cluster\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe **Cluster** class is responsible for accessing the FAT entries and the corresponding physical cluster. The class **FAT** is an aggregation of a particular number of **Cluster** instances. Every cluster is uniquely defined by the ID, which also determines its position in FAT and corresponding sectors in the data region. When the cluster is allocated, it includes a reference to a file or directory. It happens only if the cluster is the first in the allocation chain. The cluster contains information about whether it is empty and the last in the file allocation linked list. If not, it includes a reference to the next cluster in the linked list. In practical usage, the cluster doesn\\'t need to access its file, but the other way around. The **File** or **Directory** accesses its cluster, to retrieve the entire content that might be chained.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/fat_table.svg\\n   :align: center\\n   :alt: Table diagram\\n\\n\\nClass Directory\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThis class represents the file system directory. An instance of **Directory** contains the reference to the corresponding instance of **Cluster**, which has the first cluster in the allocation chain for the directory given. The root directory is a special case with a different count of sectors and a slightly different instantiation process. However, the root directory is still an instance of this class and is the only **Directory** instance associated with the class **FATFS** and **WLFATFS** respectively. The class **Directory** (except for the root directory) has one-to-one association with the class **Entry** that defines its entry in the parent directory. It also has an aggregation associated with the class **Entry**, because every directory contains multiple entries that consist of the actual directory\\'s content (for example, aliases, files, and directories).\\n\\nClass File\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSimilar to the class **Directory**, **File** represents single file in the file system. This class has one-to-one association with its first cluster in the allocation chain. Through this cluster, the **File** class may access the corresponding physical address and thus modifying its content. Every file also has one-to-one association with **Entry** instance belonging to its parent directory.\\n\\nClass Entry\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n**Entry** encapsulates information about the file/directory name in the data region of corresponding parent directory. Every file system entity (File/Directory) has an entry. In case of the symlink, the entity can have multiple entries. The directory uses entries to access its descendant files and sub-directories, and enables traversing the tree structure. Except for that, **Entry** holds the name, extension, size, and information regarding the used file name size (long file names or file names 8.3), etc.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/tree_fatfs.svg\\n   :align: center\\n   :alt: Tree diagram\\n\\n\\n``fatfsgen.py``\\n---------------\\n\\n:component_file:`fatfsgen.py <fatfs/fatfsgen.py>` generates FAT file systems on the host.\\n\\n``fatfsgen.py`` recursively traverses the given folder\\'s directory structure and adds files and/or directories inside the binary partition. Users can set if the script generates the partition with wear levelling support, long file names support, and support for preserving the modification date and time from the original folder on the host.\\n\\nThe ``./fatfsgen.py Espressif`` command generates a simple binary partition with the default settings. Here ``Espressif`` is the local folder (containing files and/or sub-directories) from which binary image is generated.\\n\\nThere exist two scripts for that purpose, :component_file:`fatfsgen.py <fatfs/fatfsgen.py>` and :component_file:`wl_fatfsgen.py <fatfs/wl_fatfsgen.py>`. The difference is that ``wl_fatfsgen.py`` firstly uses ``fatfsgen.py`` for generating the partition and then initializes wear leveling.\\n\\nThe script command line arguments are as follows::\\n\\n    fatfsgen.py [-h] [--output_file OUTPUT_FILE] [--partition_size PARTITION_SIZE] [--sector_size {4096}] [--long_name_support] [--use_default_datetime] input_directory\\n\\n    --output_file: path to the generated binary partition\\n    --partition_size: defines the size of the binary partition (decimal, hexa or binary number)\\n    --sector_size: the size of the sector\\n    --long_name_support: flag for supporting long file names\\n    --use_default_datetime: this flag forces using default dates and times (date == 0x2100, time == 0x0000), not using argument to preserve the original file system metadata\\n    input_directory: required argument, name of the directory being encoded to the binary fat-compatibile partition\\n\\n``fatfsparse.py``\\n-----------------\\n\\n:component_file:`fatfsparse.py <fatfs/fatfsparse.py>` translates the binary image into the internal representation and generates the folder with equivalent content on the host. If user requires a parsing partition with initialized wear levelling, the ``fatfsparse.py`` will remove the wear levelling sectors using the function ``remove_wl`` provided by ``wl_fatfsgen.py``. After the sectors are removed, parsing of the partition is the same as with no initial wear levelling.\\n\\n``./fatfsparse.py fatfs_image.img`` command yields the directory with the equivalent content as the binary data image ``fatfs_image.img``.\\n\\nThe script command line arguments are as follows::\\n\\n    fatfsparse.py [-h] [--wl-layer {detect,enabled,disabled}] input_image\\n\\n    --wl-layer: indicates if wear leveling is enabled, disabled or should be detected (detection is ambiguous)\\n    input_image: path to binary image\\n\\nThe long file names can be detected automatically. However, the wear leveling cannot be 100\\\\% detected, because one partition can be valid either with or without wear leveling, according to the user\\'s context. When the script finds wear leveling sectors (cfg and state), it assumes wear leveling is enabled, however it might be a false positive.\\n\\n\\nFeatures\\n--------\\n\\nFAT12/FAT16\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe supported FAT types are FAT12 and FAT16. For smaller partitions, FAT12 is sufficient. The type is detected according to the count of clusters, and cannot be changed by the user. If there are less than 4085 clusters, the selected type is FAT12 (FAT\\'s entries have 12 bits). For partitions with 4085 to 65526 clusters (with 4085 and 65526 excluded), the type is FAT16. Currently ``fatfsgen.py`` or ``fatfsparse.py`` cannot process file systems with more than 65525 clusters.\\n\\n.. _fafsgen-wear-levelling:\\n\\nWear Levelling\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThere are two types of operations related to the wear levelling layer, initializing wear leveling records and removing wear leveling records during generation and parsing of the FAT file system image.\\n\\n1. Initializing Wear Levelling\\n\\nWhen a new image with wear leveling support is generated, the script initializes few extra sectors necessary for the wear leveling function.\\n\\n    - The dummy sector: This is an empty sector placed at the beginning of the partition and it will be ignored when file system is being mounted. The dummy sector copies the content of the next sector and then swaps its position with the next sector (or the first sector in case dummy sector was the last) after particular number of erase cycles. In this way, each FAT file system sector traverses across the whole range of flash partition, and thus the erase cycles corresponding to this sector gets distributed across the entire flash.\\n\\n    - The state sector: State sector has 64 byte data stored.\\n        - pos: position of the dummy sector\\n        - max_pos: number of sectors in the partition (excluding config and state sectors)\\n        - move_count: indicates how many times dummy sector traversed through the entire flash\\n        - access_count: count of sector erase cycles after which dummy sector will swap its position\\n        - max_count: equal to wl_config_t::updaterate\\n        - block_size: equal to wl_config_t::page_size\\n        - version: equal to wl_config_t::version\\n        - device_id: generated randomly when the state is first initialized\\n        - reserved: 7 x 32-bit words, set to 0\\n        - crc32: crc32 of all the previous fields, including reserved\\n\\n      Also, the state sector will be appended by 16-byte ``pos update record`` for every value of ``pos``. Thus, this record will help us to determine the position of the dummy sector.\\n\\n      Since ``erase + write`` operation of the state sector is not atomic, we may lose the data if the power is cut off between \"erase\" and \"write\". However, two copies of the state are maintained to recover the state after the power outage. On each update, both copies are updated. Thus, after power outage, we can revert the original valid state.\\n\\n    - The config sector: This sector contains the information about the partition used by the wear leveling layer.\\n        - start_addr: start address of partition (always 0)\\n        - full_mem_size: size of the partition, including data, dummy, state x 2, config sectors. Value is in bytes\\n        - page_size: equal to sector size (generally 4096)\\n        - sector_size: always 4096 for the types of NOR flash supported by ESP-IDF\\n        - updaterate: ESP-IDF always sets this to 16. Could be made a config option at some point\\n        - wr_size: always set to 16\\n        - version: current version is 2\\n        - temp_buff_size: always set to 32 (This shouldn\\'t actually have been stored in flash)\\n        - crc: crc32 of all the previous values\\n\\n2. Removing Wear Levelling\\nWhile removing wear leveling records, we have to find the position of the dummy sector, and the original and valid orders of the partition (because traversing the dummy sector shuffles the partition). The script can remove other wear leveling sectors from the partition. Steps to remove wear leveling records are given below:\\n\\n    - Find the ``pos``, position of the dummy sector, which will be determined by the number of ``pos update records`` in the state sector.\\n    - Create the new image by removing dummy sector and merging remaining sectors before and after dummy sector.\\n    - Then remove the wear leveling state sectors and config sector which are placed at the end of the partition.\\n    - Reorder the new image to get its original order. ``move_count`` helps us to find the beginning of the partition. The partition will start at the position ``end_of_partition - move_count``. Thus the beginning of the partition after removing wear leveling sectors will be ``partition[end_of_partition - (move_count*page_size)]``.\\n\\nFile Names Encoding\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe protocol FAT supports two types of file names.\\n\\nShort File Names (SFN)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe SFN is mandatory for the implementation of file names. SFN refer to the 8.3 file name convention, with 8 characters for the file name and 3 characters for the extension. This pattern is case-insensitive, however, all file names are changed to uppercase in the inner representation of the generator. The entry describing the short file names is 32 bytes long and its structure is as follows::\\n\\n    Offset:   00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F\\n    0x000000: 46 49 4C 45 4E 41 4D 45 45 58 54 20 18 00 00 00    FILENAMEEXT.....\\n    0x000010: 21 00 21 00 00 00 00 00 21 00 02 00 1E 00 00 00    !.!.....!.......\\n\\nThe entry denotes the file with 8.3 file name (\"FILENAME.EXT\") __(0x00/00-0A)__ of size 0x1E = 30 bytes __(0x10/0x0C)__, with default times of modification and creation (0x0021) __(0x10/00,02 and 08)__. The relevant cluster for the file is located at __0x02 (0x10/0A)__. Please notice that a character is encoded using one byte (e.g., __0x46 == \\'F\\'__)\\n\\nLong File Names (LFN)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe LFN supports 255 characters excluding the trailing ``NULL``. The LFN supports any character as short file names with an additional period ``.`` and the following special characters: ``+ , ; = [ ]``. LFN uses UNICODE, so the character is encoded using 2 bytes.\\n\\nThe structure of one name encoded using LFN is as follows::\\n\\n    00003000: 42 65 00 2E 00 74 00 78 00 74 00 0F 00 43 FF FF    Be...t.x.t...C..\\n    00003010: FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF 00 00 FF FF FF FF    ................\\n    00003020: 01 74 00 68 00 69 00 73 00 69 00 0F 00 43 73 00    .t.h.i.s.i...Cs.\\n    00003030: 6C 00 6F 00 6E 00 67 00 66 00 00 00 69 00 6C 00    l.o.n.g.f...i.l.\\n    00003040: 54 48 49 53 49 53 7E 31 54 58 54 20 00 00 D6 45    THISIS~1TXT...VE\\n    00003050: 26 55 26 55 00 00 D6 45 26 55 02 00 1C 00 00 00    &U&U..VE&U......\\n\\nThe above example encodes a file name ``thisislongfile.txt``. The record is composed of multiple entries. The first entry contains metadata and is equivalent to the SFN entry. This entry might be final if the file name conforms to the 8.3 file name convention. In such scenarios, the SFN pattern is used. Otherwise, the generator adds various entries with the LFN structure above the SFN entry. These entries hold information about the file name and its checksum for consistency. Every LFN record can hold 13 characters (26 bytes). The file name is firstly cut into some amount of 13-character substrings and these are added above the SFN entry.\\n\\nWe add LFN entries in reversed order, so the first entry in the directory is the last part of the file name and the last is SFN entry. In the above example, we can see that the first entry contains text ``e.txt``, while the others contain the beginning of the name ``thisislongfil``. The first byte in LFN entries denotes an order or the sequence number (numbered from 1). To determine the first entry of the LFN, the first byte is masked with 0x40 (``first_byte =| 0x40``). The specification says that the last entry value will be ORed with 0x40 and it is the mark for the last entry. For example, when the record is the second and also the last in the LFN entry, its first byte is ``0x42``.\\n\\nThe LFN entry is signed at field **DIR_Attr** with value ``ATTR_READ_ONLY | ATTR_HIDDEN | ATTR_SYSTEM | ATTR_VOLUME_ID`` (see the file ``long_filename_utils.py``). The SFN entry (possibly also within LFN) contains either ``ATTR_DIRECTORY`` or ``ATTR_ARCHIVE`` in this field for directory or file respectively.\\n\\nThe LFN entry is tagged at the field **DIR_NTRes** with the value ``0x00``. This is a sign of the SFN entry in the LFN record, if the entry is a whole SFN record, the value is ``0x18``. As you can see in the first example, the value at this field is ``0x18``, because the name **\"FILENAME.EXT\"** fits the SFN. However, the recent example showing **\"thisislongfile.txt\"** has value ``0x00`` at field **DIR_NTRes** in the last entry, since it is a LFN. The SFN needs to be unique. For that purpose, the ``fatfsgen.py`` uses the first 6 characters from the file name, concatenating with ``~`` and with ID denoting the order of the name with the same prefix. The ID is between 0 to 127, which is the maximal amount of files with the same prefix.\\n\\nCalculation of the checksum is described and implemented in the ``utils.py`` by function ``lfn_checksum``. The ``fatfsparse.py`` assumes that the LFN entries might not be right next to each other, but it assumes the relative order is preserved. The approach is first to find the SFN belonging to some LFN record (using **DIR_NTRes** field). From then, the script starts to search by moving upwards to the beginning of the respective sector, until it finds the last entry in the LFN record (the one with the first half byte equal to 4). The entries are distinguished by their checksums. When finished, the file name can be composed.\\n\\nDate and Time in FAT File System\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe FAT file system protocol used by ESP-IDF does not preserve the date or time on the chips\\' media, so all the images extracted from the device have the same default timestamp for all the FAT-specified date-time fields (creation and the last modification timestamp as well as creation, last modification and last access dates).\\n\\nThere are a couple of fields in the SFN entry describing time, such as **DIR_CrtTime** and **DIR_WrtTime**. Some fields are ignored by the FAT implementation used by ESP-IDF (see the file ``entry.py``). However, changes in the fields **DIR_WrtTime** and **DIR_WrtDate** are preserved in the chip. Both time and data entry are 16-bit, where the granularity of the time is 2 seconds.\\n',\n",

       " 'Non-Volatile Storage Library\\n============================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nNon-volatile storage (NVS) library is designed to store key-value pairs in flash. This section introduces some concepts used by NVS.\\n\\nUnderlying Storage\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nCurrently, NVS uses a portion of main flash memory through the :ref:`esp_partition <flash-partition-apis>` API. The library uses all the partitions with ``data`` type and ``nvs`` subtype.  The application can choose to use the partition with the label ``nvs`` through the :cpp:func:`nvs_open` API function or any other partition by specifying its name using the :cpp:func:`nvs_open_from_partition` API function.\\n\\nFuture versions of this library may have other storage backends to keep data in another flash chip (SPI or I2C), RTC, FRAM, etc.\\n\\n.. note:: if an NVS partition is truncated (for example, when the partition table layout is changed), its contents should be erased. ESP-IDF build system provides a ``idf.py erase-flash`` target to erase all contents of the flash chip.\\n\\n.. note:: NVS works best for storing many small values, rather than a few large values of the type \\'string\\' and \\'blob\\'. If you need to store large blobs or strings, consider using the facilities provided by the FAT filesystem on top of the wear levelling library.\\n\\n\\nKeys and Values\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nNVS operates on key-value pairs. Keys are ASCII strings; the maximum key length is currently 15 characters. Values can have one of the following types:\\n\\n-  integer types: ``uint8_t``, ``int8_t``, ``uint16_t``, ``int16_t``, ``uint32_t``, ``int32_t``, ``uint64_t``, ``int64_t``\\n-  zero-terminated string\\n-  variable length binary data (blob)\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    String values are currently limited to 4000 bytes. This includes the null terminator. Blob values are limited to 508,000 bytes or 97.6% of the partition size - 4000 bytes, whichever is lower.\\n\\nAdditional types, such as ``float`` and ``double`` might be added later.\\n\\nKeys are required to be unique. Assigning a new value to an existing key replaces the old value and data type with the value and data type specified by a write operation.\\n\\nA data type check is performed when reading a value. An error is returned if the data type expected by read operation does not match the data type of entry found for the key provided.\\n\\n\\nNamespaces\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTo mitigate potential conflicts in key names between different components, NVS assigns each key-value pair to one of namespaces. Namespace names follow the same rules as key names, i.e., the maximum length is 15 characters. Furthermore, there can be no more than 254 different namespaces in one NVS partition. Namespace name is specified in the :cpp:func:`nvs_open` or :cpp:type:`nvs_open_from_partition` call. This call returns an opaque handle, which is used in subsequent calls to the ``nvs_get_*``, ``nvs_set_*``, and :cpp:func:`nvs_commit` functions. This way, a handle is associated with a namespace, and key names will not collide with same names in other namespaces. Please note that the namespaces with the same name in different NVS partitions are considered as separate namespaces.\\n\\nNVS Iterators\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIterators allow to list key-value pairs stored in NVS, based on specified partition name, namespace, and data type.\\n\\nThere are the following functions available:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`nvs_entry_find` creates an opaque handle, which is used in subsequent calls to the :cpp:func:`nvs_entry_next` and :cpp:func:`nvs_entry_info` functions.\\n- :cpp:func:`nvs_entry_next` advances an iterator to the next key-value pair.\\n- :cpp:func:`nvs_entry_info` returns information about each key-value pair\\n\\nIn general, all iterators obtained via :cpp:func:`nvs_entry_find` have to be released using :cpp:func:`nvs_release_iterator`, which also tolerates ``NULL`` iterators.\\n\\n:cpp:func:`nvs_entry_find` and :cpp:func:`nvs_entry_next` set the given iterator to ``NULL`` or a valid iterator in all cases except a parameter error occured (i.e., return ``ESP_ERR_NVS_NOT_FOUND``). In case of a parameter error, the given iterator will not be modified. Hence, it is best practice to initialize the iterator to ``NULL`` before calling :cpp:func:`nvs_entry_find` to avoid complicated error checking before releasing the iterator.\\n\\n\\nSecurity, Tampering, and Robustness\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_HMAC_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    NVS is not directly compatible with the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} flash encryption system. However, data can still be stored in encrypted form if NVS encryption is used together with {IDF_TARGET_NAME} flash encryption. Please refer to :doc:`nvs_encryption` for more details.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_HMAC_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    NVS is not directly compatible with the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} flash encryption system. However, data can still be stored in encrypted form if NVS encryption is used together with {IDF_TARGET_NAME} flash encryption or with the help of the HMAC peripheral. Please refer to :doc:`nvs_encryption` for more details.\\n\\nIf NVS encryption is not used, it is possible for anyone with physical access to the flash chip to alter, erase, or add key-value pairs. With NVS encryption enabled, it is not possible to alter or add a key-value pair and get recognized as a valid pair without knowing corresponding NVS encryption keys. However, there is no tamper-resistance against the erase operation.\\n\\nThe library does try to recover from conditions when flash memory is in an inconsistent state. In particular, one should be able to power off the device at any point and time and then power it back on. This should not result in loss of data, except for the new key-value pair if it was being written at the moment of powering off. The library should also be able to initialize properly with any random data present in flash memory.\\n\\n\\n.. _nvs_encryption:\\n\\nNVS Encryption\\n--------------\\n\\nPlease refer to the :doc:`nvs_encryption` guide for more details.\\n\\nNVS Partition Generator Utility\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nThis utility helps generate NVS partition binary files which can be flashed separately on a dedicated partition via a flashing utility. Key-value pairs to be flashed onto the partition can be provided via a CSV file. For more details, please refer to :doc:`nvs_partition_gen`.\\n\\nInstead of calling the ``nvs_partition_gen.py`` tool manually, the creation of the partition binary files can also be done directly from CMake using the function ``nvs_create_partition_image``::\\n\\n    nvs_create_partition_image(<partition> <csv> [FLASH_IN_PROJECT] [DEPENDS  dep dep dep ...])\\n\\n**Positional Arguments**:\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Parameter\\n      - Description\\n    * - ``partition``\\n      - Name of the NVS parition\\n    * - ``csv``\\n      - Path to CSV file to parse\\n\\n\\n**Optional Arguments**:\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n\\n   * - Parameter\\n     - Description\\n   * - ``FLASH_IN_PROJECT``\\n     - Name of the NVS parition\\n   * - ``DEPENDS``\\n     - Specify files on which the command depends\\n\\n\\nIf ``FLASH_IN_PROJECT`` is not specified, the image will still be generated, but you will have to flash it manually using ``idf.py <partition>-flash`` (e.g., if your parition name is ``nvs``, then use ``idf.py nvs-flash``).\\n\\n``nvs_create_partition_image`` must be called from one of the component ``CMakeLists.txt`` files. Currently, only non-encrypted partitions are supported.\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\nYou can find code examples in the :example:`storage` directory of ESP-IDF examples:\\n\\n:example:`storage/nvs_rw_value`\\n\\n  Demonstrates how to read a single integer value from, and write it to NVS.\\n\\n  The value checked in this example holds the number of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} module restarts. The value\\'s function as a counter is only possible due to its storing in NVS.\\n\\n  The example also shows how to check if a read/write operation was successful, or if a certain value has not been initialized in NVS. The diagnostic procedure is provided in plain text to help you track the program flow and capture any issues on the way.\\n\\n:example:`storage/nvs_rw_blob`\\n\\n  Demonstrates how to read a single integer value and a blob (binary large object), and write them to NVS to preserve this value between {IDF_TARGET_NAME} module restarts.\\n\\n    * value - tracks the number of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} module soft and hard restarts.\\n    * blob - contains a table with module run times. The table is read from NVS to dynamically allocated RAM. A new run time is added to the table on each manually triggered soft restart, and then the added run time is written to NVS. Triggering is done by pulling down GPIO0.\\n\\n  The example also shows how to implement the diagnostic procedure to check if the read/write operation was successful.\\n\\n:example:`storage/nvs_rw_value_cxx`\\n\\n  This example does exactly the same as :example:`storage/nvs_rw_value`, except that it uses the C++ NVS handle class.\\n\\nInternals\\n---------\\n\\nLog of Key-Value Pairs\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nNVS stores key-value pairs sequentially, with new key-value pairs being added at the end. When a value of any given key has to be updated, a new key-value pair is added at the end of the log and the old key-value pair is marked as erased.\\n\\nPages and Entries\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nNVS library uses two main entities in its operation: pages and entries. Page is a logical structure which stores a portion of the overall log. Logical page corresponds to one physical sector of flash memory. Pages which are in use have a *sequence number* associated with them. Sequence numbers impose an ordering on pages. Higher sequence numbers correspond to pages which were created later. Each page can be in one of the following states:\\n\\nEmpty/uninitialized\\n    Flash storage for the page is empty (all bytes are ``0xff``). Page is not used to store any data at this point and does not have a sequence number.\\n\\nActive\\n    Flash storage is initialized, page header has been written to flash, page has a valid sequence number. Page has some empty entries and data can be written there. No more than one page can be in this state at any given moment.\\n\\nFull\\n    Flash storage is in a consistent state and is filled with key-value pairs.\\n    Writing new key-value pairs into this page is not possible. It is still possible to mark some key-value pairs as erased.\\n\\nErasing\\n    Non-erased key-value pairs are being moved into another page so that the current page can be erased. This is a transient state, i.e., page should never stay in this state at the time when any API call returns. In case of a sudden power off, the move-and-erase process will be completed upon the next power-on.\\n\\nCorrupted\\n    Page header contains invalid data, and further parsing of page data was canceled. Any items previously written into this page will not be accessible. The corresponding flash sector will not be erased immediately and will be kept along with sectors in **uninitialized** state for later use. This may be useful for debugging.\\n\\nMapping from flash sectors to logical pages does not have any particular order. The library will inspect sequence numbers of pages found in each flash sector and organize pages in a list based on these numbers.\\n\\n::\\n\\n    +--------+     +--------+     +--------+     +--------+\\n    | Page 1 |     | Page 2 |     | Page 3 |     | Page 4 |\\n    | Full   +---> | Full   +---> | Active |     | Empty  |   <- states\\n    | #11    |     | #12    |     | #14    |     |        |   <- sequence numbers\\n    +---+----+     +----+---+     +----+---+     +---+----+\\n        |               |              |             |\\n        |               |              |             |\\n        |               |              |             |\\n    +---v------+  +-----v----+  +------v---+  +------v---+\\n    | Sector 3 |  | Sector 0 |  | Sector 2 |  | Sector 1 |    <- physical sectors\\n    +----------+  +----------+  +----------+  +----------+\\n\\nStructure of a Page\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFor now, we assume that flash sector size is 4096 bytes and that {IDF_TARGET_NAME} flash encryption hardware operates on 32-byte blocks. It is possible to introduce some settings configurable at compile-time (e.g., via menuconfig) to accommodate flash chips with different sector sizes (although it is not clear if other components in the system, e.g., SPI flash driver and SPI flash cache can support these other sizes).\\n\\nPage consists of three parts: header, entry state bitmap, and entries themselves. To be compatible with {IDF_TARGET_NAME} flash encryption, the entry size is 32 bytes. For integer types, an entry holds one key-value pair. For strings and blobs, an entry holds part of key-value pair (more on that in the entry structure description).\\n\\nThe following diagram illustrates the page structure. Numbers in parentheses indicate the size of each part in bytes.\\n\\n::\\n\\n    +-----------+--------------+-------------+-------------------------+\\n    | State (4) | Seq. no. (4) | version (1) | Unused (19) | CRC32 (4) |   Header (32)\\n    +-----------+--------------+-------------+-------------------------+\\n    |                Entry state bitmap (32)                           |\\n    +------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n    |                       Entry 0 (32)                               |\\n    +------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n    |                       Entry 1 (32)                               |\\n    +------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n    /                                                                  /\\n    /                                                                  /\\n    +------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n    |                       Entry 125 (32)                             |\\n    +------------------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\nPage header and entry state bitmap are always written to flash unencrypted. Entries are encrypted if flash encryption feature of {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is used.\\n\\nPage state values are defined in such a way that changing state is possible by writing 0 into some of the bits. Therefore it is not necessary to erase the page to change its state unless that is a change to the *erased* state.\\n\\nThe version field in the header reflects the NVS format version used. For backward compatibility reasons, it is decremented for every version upgrade starting at 0xff (i.e., 0xff for version-1, 0xfe for version-2 and so on).\\n\\nCRC32 value in the header is calculated over the part which does not include a state value (bytes 4 to 28). The unused part is currently filled with ``0xff`` bytes.\\n\\nThe following sections describe the structure of entry state bitmap and entry itself.\\n\\nEntry and Entry State Bitmap\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nEach entry can be in one of the following three states represented with two bits in the entry state bitmap. The final four bits in the bitmap (256 - 2 * 126) are not used.\\n\\nEmpty (2\\'b11)\\n    Nothing is written into the specific entry yet. It is in an uninitialized state (all bytes are ``0xff``).\\n\\nWritten (2\\'b10)\\n    A key-value pair (or part of key-value pair which spans multiple entries) has been written into the entry.\\n\\nErased (2\\'b00)\\n    A key-value pair in this entry has been discarded. Contents of this entry will not be parsed anymore.\\n\\n\\n.. _structure_of_entry:\\n\\nStructure of Entry\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFor values of primitive types (currently integers from 1 to 8 bytes long), entry holds one key-value pair. For string and blob types, entry holds part of the whole key-value pair. For strings, in case when a key-value pair spans multiple entries, all entries are stored in the same page. Blobs are allowed to span over multiple pages by dividing them into smaller chunks. For tracking these chunks, an additional fixed length metadata entry is stored called \"blob index\". Earlier formats of blobs are still supported (can be read and modified). However, once the blobs are modified, they are stored using the new format.\\n\\n::\\n\\n    +--------+----------+----------+----------------+-----------+---------------+----------+\\n    | NS (1) | Type (1) | Span (1) | ChunkIndex (1) | CRC32 (4) |    Key (16)   | Data (8) |\\n    +--------+----------+----------+----------------+-----------+---------------+----------+\\n\\n                                             Primitive  +--------------------------------+\\n                                            +-------->  |     Data (8)                   |\\n                                            | Types     +--------------------------------+\\n                       +-> Fixed length --\\n                       |                    |           +---------+--------------+---------------+-------+\\n                       |                    +-------->  | Size(4) | ChunkCount(1)| ChunkStart(1) | Rsv(2)|\\n        Data format ---+                    Blob Index  +---------+--------------+---------------+-------+\\n                       |\\n                       |                             +----------+---------+-----------+\\n                       +->   Variable length   -->   | Size (2) | Rsv (2) | CRC32 (4) |\\n                            (Strings, Blob Data)     +----------+---------+-----------+\\n\\n\\nIndividual fields in entry structure have the following meanings:\\n\\nNS\\n    Namespace index for this entry. For more information on this value, see the section on namespaces implementation.\\n\\nType\\n    One byte indicating the value data type. See the :cpp:type:`ItemType` enumeration in :component_file:`nvs_flash/include/nvs_handle.hpp` for possible values.\\n\\nSpan\\n    Number of entries used by this key-value pair. For integer types, this is equal to 1. For strings and blobs, this depends on value length.\\n\\nChunkIndex\\n    Used to store the index of a blob-data chunk for blob types. For other types, this should be ``0xff``.\\n\\nCRC32\\n    Checksum calculated over all the bytes in this entry, except for the CRC32 field itself.\\n\\nKey\\n    Zero-terminated ASCII string containing a key name. Maximum string length is 15 bytes, excluding a zero terminator.\\n\\nData\\n    For integer types, this field contains the value itself. If the value itself is shorter than 8 bytes, it is padded to the right, with unused bytes filled with ``0xff``.\\n\\n    For \"blob index\" entry, these 8 bytes hold the following information about data-chunks:\\n\\n    - Size\\n        (Only for blob index.) Size, in bytes, of complete blob data.\\n\\n    - ChunkCount\\n        (Only for blob index.) Total number of blob-data chunks into which the blob was divided during storage.\\n\\n    - ChunkStart\\n        (Only for blob index.) ChunkIndex of the first blob-data chunk of this blob. Subsequent chunks have chunkIndex incrementally allocated (step of 1).\\n\\n    For string and blob data chunks, these 8 bytes hold additional data about the value, which are described below:\\n\\n    - Size\\n        (Only for strings and blobs.) Size, in bytes, of actual data. For strings, this includes zero terminators.\\n\\n    - CRC32\\n        (Only for strings and blobs.) Checksum calculated over all bytes of data.\\n\\nVariable length values (strings and blobs) are written into subsequent entries, 32 bytes per entry. The ``Span`` field of the first entry indicates how many entries are used.\\n\\n\\nNamespaces\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAs mentioned above, each key-value pair belongs to one of the namespaces. Namespace identifiers (strings) are stored as keys of key-value pairs in namespace with index 0. Values corresponding to these keys are indexes of these namespaces.\\n\\n::\\n\\n    +-------------------------------------------+\\n    | NS=0 Type=uint8_t Key=\"wifi\" Value=1      |   Entry describing namespace \"wifi\"\\n    +-------------------------------------------+\\n    | NS=1 Type=uint32_t Key=\"channel\" Value=6  |   Key \"channel\" in namespace \"wifi\"\\n    +-------------------------------------------+\\n    | NS=0 Type=uint8_t Key=\"pwm\" Value=2       |   Entry describing namespace \"pwm\"\\n    +-------------------------------------------+\\n    | NS=2 Type=uint16_t Key=\"channel\" Value=20 |   Key \"channel\" in namespace \"pwm\"\\n    +-------------------------------------------+\\n\\n\\nItem Hash List\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTo reduce the number of reads from flash memory, each member of the Page class maintains a list of pairs: item index; item hash. This list makes searches much quicker. Instead of iterating over all entries, reading them from flash one at a time, `Page::findItem` first performs a search for the item hash in the hash list. This gives the item index within the page if such an item exists. Due to a hash collision, it is possible that a different item is found. This is handled by falling back to iteration over items in flash.\\n\\nEach node in the hash list contains a 24-bit hash and 8-bit item index. Hash is calculated based on item namespace, key name, and ChunkIndex. CRC32 is used for calculation; the result is truncated to 24 bits. To reduce the overhead for storing 32-bit entries in a linked list, the list is implemented as a double-linked list of arrays. Each array holds 29 entries, for the total size of 128 bytes, together with linked list pointers and a 32-bit count field. The minimum amount of extra RAM usage per page is therefore 128 bytes; maximum is 640 bytes.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/nvs_flash.inc\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/nvs.inc\\n',\n",
       " 'FAT Filesystem Support\\n======================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nESP-IDF uses the `FatFs <http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html>`_ library to work with FAT filesystems. FatFs resides in the ``fatfs`` component. Although the library can be used directly, many of its features can be accessed via VFS using the C standard library and POSIX API functions.\\n\\nAdditionally, FatFs has been modified to support the runtime pluggable disk I/O layer. This allows mapping of FatFs drives to physical disks at runtime.\\n\\n\\nUsing FatFs with VFS\\n--------------------\\n\\nThe header file :component_file:`fatfs/vfs/esp_vfs_fat.h` defines the functions for connecting FatFs and VFS.\\n\\nThe function :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_register` allocates a ``FATFS`` structure and registers a given path prefix in VFS. Subsequent operations on files starting with this prefix are forwarded to FatFs APIs.\\n\\nThe function :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_unregister_path` deletes the registration with VFS, and frees the ``FATFS`` structure.\\n\\nMost applications use the following workflow when working with ``esp_vfs_fat_`` functions:\\n\\n#. Call :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_register` to specify:\\n    - Path prefix where to mount the filesystem (e.g., ``\"/sdcard\"``, ``\"/spiflash\"``)\\n    - FatFs drive number\\n    - A variable which receives the pointer to the ``FATFS`` structure\\n\\n#. Call :cpp:func:`ff_diskio_register` to register the disk I/O driver for the drive number used in Step 1.\\n\\n#. To mount the filesystem using the same drive number which was passed to :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_register`, call the FatFs function :cpp:func:`f_mount`. If the filesystem is not present on the target logical drive, :cpp:func:`f_mount` will fail with the ``FR_NO_FILESYSTEM`` error. In such case, call :cpp:func:`f_mkfs` to create a fresh FatFS structure on the drive first, and then call :cpp:func:`f_mount` again. Note that SD cards need to be partitioned with :cpp:func:`f_fdisk` prior to previously described steps. For more information, see `FatFs documentation <http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/doc/mount.html>`_.\\n\\n#. Call the C standard library and POSIX API functions to perform such actions on files as open, read, write, erase, copy, etc. Use paths starting with the path prefix passed to :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_register` (for example, ``\"/sdcard/hello.txt\"``). The filesystem uses `8.3 filenames <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8.3_filename>`_ format (SFN) by default. If you need to use long filenames (LFN), enable the :ref:`CONFIG_FATFS_LONG_FILENAMES` option. Please refer to `FatFs filenames <http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/doc/filename.html>`_ for more details.\\n\\n#. Optionally, call the FatFs library functions directly. In this case, use paths without a VFS prefix, for example, ``\"/hello.txt\"``.\\n\\n#. Close all open files.\\n\\n#. Call the FatFs function :cpp:func:`f_mount` for the same drive number with NULL ``FATFS*`` argument to unmount the filesystem.\\n\\n#. Call the FatFs function :cpp:func:`ff_diskio_register` with NULL ``ff_diskio_impl_t*`` argument and the same drive number to unregister the disk I/O driver.\\n\\n#. Call :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_unregister_path` with the path where the file system is mounted to remove FatFs from VFS, and free the ``FATFS`` structure allocated in Step 1.\\n\\nThe convenience functions :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_sdmmc_mount`, :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_sdspi_mount`, and :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_sdcard_unmount` wrap the steps described above and also handle SD card initialization. These functions are described in the next section.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   Because FAT filesystem does not support hardlinks, :cpp:func:`link` copies contents of the file instead. (This only applies to files on FatFs volumes.)\\n\\n\\nUsing FatFs with VFS and SD Cards\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nThe header file :component_file:`fatfs/vfs/esp_vfs_fat.h` defines convenience functions :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_sdmmc_mount`, :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_sdspi_mount`, and :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_sdcard_unmount`. These functions perform Steps 1–3 and 7–9 respectively and handle SD card initialization, but provide only limited error handling. Developers are encouraged to check its source code and incorporate more advanced features into production applications.\\n\\nThe convenience function :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_sdmmc_unmount` unmounts the filesystem and releases the resources acquired by :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_sdmmc_mount`.\\n\\n\\nUsing FatFs with VFS in Read-Only Mode\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nThe header file :component_file:`fatfs/vfs/esp_vfs_fat.h` also defines the convenience functions :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_spiflash_mount_ro` and :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_spiflash_unmount_ro`. These functions perform Steps 1-3 and 7-9 respectively for read-only FAT partitions. These are particularly helpful for data partitions written only once during factory provisioning, which will not be changed by production application throughout the lifetime of the hardware.\\n\\nConfiguration options\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe following configuration options are available for the FatFs component:\\n\\n* :ref:`CONFIG_FATFS_USE_FASTSEEK` - If enabled, the POSIX :cpp:func:`lseek` function will be performed faster. The fast seek does not work for files in write mode, so to take advantage of fast seek, you should open (or close and then reopen) the file in read-only mode.\\n* :ref:`CONFIG_FATFS_IMMEDIATE_FSYNC` - If enabled, the FatFs will automatically call :cpp:func:`f_sync` to flush recent file changes after each call of :cpp:func:`write`, :cpp:func:`pwrite`, :cpp:func:`link`, :cpp:func:`truncate` and :cpp:func:`ftruncate` functions. This feature improves file-consistency and size reporting accuracy for the FatFs, at a price on decreased performance due to frequent disk operations.\\n* :ref:`CONFIG_FATFS_LINK_LOCK` - If enabled, this option guarantees the API thread safety, while disabling this option might be necessary for applications that require fast frequent small file operations (e.g., logging to a file). Note that if this option is disabled, the copying performed by :cpp:func:`link` will be non-atomic. In such case, using :cpp:func:`link` on a large file on the same volume in a different task is not guaranteed to be thread safe.\\n\\n\\nFatFS Disk IO Layer\\n-------------------\\n\\nFatFs has been extended with API functions that register the disk I/O driver at runtime.\\n\\nThese APIs provide implementation of disk I/O functions for SD/MMC cards and can be registered for the given FatFs drive number using the function :cpp:func:`ff_diskio_register_sdmmc`.\\n\\n.. doxygenfunction:: ff_diskio_register\\n.. doxygenstruct:: ff_diskio_impl_t\\n    :members:\\n.. doxygenfunction:: ff_diskio_register_sdmmc\\n.. doxygenfunction:: ff_diskio_register_wl_partition\\n.. doxygenfunction:: ff_diskio_register_raw_partition\\n\\n\\n.. _fatfs-partition-generator:\\n\\nFatFs Partition Generator\\n-------------------------\\n\\nWe provide a partition generator for FatFs (:component_file:`wl_fatfsgen.py <fatfs/wl_fatfsgen.py>`) which is integrated into the build system and could be easily used in the user project.\\n\\nThe tool is used to create filesystem images on a host and populate it with content of the specified host folder.\\n\\nThe script is based on the partition generator (:component_file:`fatfsgen.py <fatfs/fatfsgen.py>`). Apart from generating partition, it can also initialize wear levelling.\\n\\nThe latest version supports both short and long file names, FAT12 and FAT16. The long file names are limited to 255 characters and can contain multiple periods (``.``) characters within the filename and additional characters ``+``, ``,``, ``;``, ``=``, ``[`` and ``]``.\\n\\nAn in-depth description of the FatFs partition generator and analyzer can be found at :doc:`Generating and parsing FAT partition on host <fatfsgen>`.\\n\\nBuild System Integration with FatFs Partition Generator\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIt is possible to invoke FatFs generator directly from the CMake build system by calling ``fatfs_create_spiflash_image``::\\n\\n    fatfs_create_spiflash_image(<partition> <base_dir> [FLASH_IN_PROJECT])\\n\\nIf you prefer generating partition without wear levelling support, you can use ``fatfs_create_rawflash_image``::\\n\\n    fatfs_create_rawflash_image(<partition> <base_dir> [FLASH_IN_PROJECT])\\n\\n``fatfs_create_spiflash_image`` respectively ``fatfs_create_rawflash_image`` must be called from project\\'s CMakeLists.txt.\\n\\nIf you decide for any reason to use ``fatfs_create_rawflash_image`` (without wear levelling support), beware that it supports mounting only in read-only mode in the device.\\n\\n\\nThe arguments of the function are as follows:\\n\\n#. partition - the name of the partition as defined in the partition table (e.g., :example_file:`storage/fatfsgen/partitions_example.csv`).\\n\\n#. base_dir - the directory that will be encoded to FatFs partition and optionally flashed into the device. Beware that you have to specify the suitable size of the partition in the partition table.\\n\\n#. flag ``FLASH_IN_PROJECT`` - optionally, users can have the image automatically flashed together with the app binaries, partition tables, etc. on ``idf.py flash -p <PORT>`` by specifying ``FLASH_IN_PROJECT``.\\n\\n#. flag ``PRESERVE_TIME`` - optionally, users can force preserving the timestamps from the source folder to the target image. Without preserving the time, every timestamp will be set to the FATFS default initial time (1st January 1980).\\n\\n#. flag ``ONE_FAT`` - optionally, users can still choose to generate a FATFS volume with a single FAT (file allocation table) instead of two. This makes the free space in the FATFS volume a bit larger (by ``number of sectors used by FAT * sector size``) but also more prone to corruption.\\n\\nFor example::\\n\\n    fatfs_create_spiflash_image(my_fatfs_partition my_folder FLASH_IN_PROJECT)\\n\\nIf FLASH_IN_PROJECT is not specified, the image will still be generated, but you will have to flash it manually using ``esptool.py`` or a custom build system target.\\n\\nFor an example, see :example:`storage/fatfsgen`.\\n\\n\\nFatFs Partition Analyzer\\n------------------------\\n\\n(:component_file:`fatfsparse.py <fatfs/fatfsparse.py>`) is a partition analyzing tool for FatFs.\\n\\nIt is a reverse tool of (:component_file:`fatfsgen.py <fatfs/fatfsgen.py>`), i.e., it can generate the folder structure on the host based on the FatFs image.\\n\\nUsage::\\n\\n    ./fatfsparse.py [-h] [--wl-layer {detect,enabled,disabled}] [--verbose] fatfs_image.img\\n\\nParameter --verbose prints detailed information from boot sector of the FatFs image to the terminal before folder structure is generated.\\n\\nHigh-level API Reference\\n------------------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_vfs_fat.inc\\n',\n",
       " \"SPIFFS Filesystem\\n=================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nSPIFFS is a file system intended for SPI NOR flash devices on embedded targets. It supports wear levelling, file system consistency checks, and more.\\n\\nNotes\\n-----\\n\\n - Currently, SPIFFS does not support directories, it produces a flat structure. If SPIFFS is mounted under ``/spiffs``, then creating a file with the path ``/spiffs/tmp/myfile.txt`` will create a file called ``/tmp/myfile.txt`` in SPIFFS, instead of ``myfile.txt`` in the directory ``/spiffs/tmp``.\\n - It is not a real-time stack. One write operation might take much longer than another.\\n - For now, it does not detect or handle bad blocks.\\n - SPIFFS is able to reliably utilize only around 75% of assigned partition space.\\n - When the filesystem is running out of space, the garbage collector is trying to find free space by scanning the filesystem multiple times, which can take up to several seconds per write function call, depending on required space. This is caused by the SPIFFS design and the issue has been reported multiple times (e.g., `here <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/1737>`_) and in the official `SPIFFS github repository <https://github.com/pellepl/spiffs/issues/>`_. The issue can be partially mitigated by the `SPIFFS configuration <https://github.com/pellepl/spiffs/wiki/Configure-spiffs>`_.\\n - When garbage collector is attempting to reclaim space by scanning the entire filesystem multiple times (usually 10 times by default), during each scan, the garbage collector frees up one block if available. Therefore, if the maximum number of runs set for the garbage collector is 'n' (SPIFFS_GC_MAX_RUNS: locate this configuration option in `SPIFFS configuration <https://github.com/pellepl/spiffs/wiki/Configure-spiffs>`_), then n times the block size will become available for data writing. If you attempt to write data exceeding n times the block size, the write operation may fail and return an error.\\n - When the chip experiences a power loss during a file system operation it could result in SPIFFS corruption. However the file system still might be recovered via ``esp_spiffs_check`` function. More details in the official SPIFFS `FAQ <https://github.com/pellepl/spiffs/wiki/FAQ>`_.\\n\\nTools\\n-----\\n\\n``spiffsgen.py``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n:component_file:`spiffsgen.py<spiffs/spiffsgen.py>` is a write-only Python SPIFFS implementation used to create filesystem images from the contents of a host folder. To use ``spiffsgen.py``, open Terminal and run::\\n\\n    python spiffsgen.py <image_size> <base_dir> <output_file>\\n\\nThe required arguments are as follows:\\n\\n- **image_size**: size of the partition onto which the created SPIFFS image will be flashed.\\n- **base_dir**: directory for which the SPIFFS image needs to be created.\\n- **output_file**: SPIFFS image output file.\\n\\nThere are also other arguments that control image generation. Documentation on these arguments can be found in the tool's help::\\n\\n    python spiffsgen.py --help\\n\\nThese optional arguments correspond to a possible SPIFFS build configuration. To generate the right image, please make sure that you use the same arguments/configuration as were used to build SPIFFS. As a guide, the help output indicates the SPIFFS build configuration to which the argument corresponds. In cases when these arguments are not specified, the default values shown in the help output will be used.\\n\\nWhen the image is created, it can be flashed using ``esptool.py`` or ``parttool.py``.\\n\\nAside from invoking the ``spiffsgen.py`` standalone by manually running it from the command line or a script, it is also possible to invoke ``spiffsgen.py`` directly from the build system by calling ``spiffs_create_partition_image``::\\n\\n    spiffs_create_partition_image(<partition> <base_dir> [FLASH_IN_PROJECT] [DEPENDS dep dep dep...])\\n\\nThis is more convenient as the build configuration is automatically passed to the tool, ensuring that the generated image is valid for that build. An example of this is while the **image_size** is required for the standalone invocation, only the **partition** name is required when using ``spiffs_create_partition_image`` -- the image size is automatically obtained from the project's partition table.\\n\\n``spiffs_create_partition_image`` must be called from one of the component ``CMakeLists.txt`` files.\\n\\nOptionally, users can opt to have the image automatically flashed together with the app binaries, partition tables, etc. on ``idf.py flash`` by specifying ``FLASH_IN_PROJECT``.  For example::\\n\\n    spiffs_create_partition_image(my_spiffs_partition my_folder FLASH_IN_PROJECT)\\n\\nIf FLASH_IN_PROJECT/SPIFFS_IMAGE_FLASH_IN_PROJECT is not specified, the image will still be generated, but you will have to flash it manually using ``esptool.py``, ``parttool.py``, or a custom build system target.\\n\\nThere are cases where the contents of the base directory itself is generated at build time. Users can use DEPENDS/SPIFFS_IMAGE_DEPENDS to specify targets that should be executed before generating the image::\\n\\n    add_custom_target(dep COMMAND ...)\\n\\n    spiffs_create_partition_image(my_spiffs_partition my_folder DEPENDS dep)\\n\\nFor an example, see :example:`storage/spiffsgen`.\\n\\n``mkspiffs``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAnother tool for creating SPIFFS partition images is `mkspiffs <https://github.com/igrr/mkspiffs>`_. Similar to ``spiffsgen.py``, it can be used to create an image from a given folder and then flash that image using ``esptool.py``\\n\\nFor that, you need to obtain the following parameters:\\n\\n- **Block Size**: 4096 (standard for SPI Flash)\\n- **Page Size**: 256 (standard for SPI Flash)\\n- **Image Size**: Size of the partition in bytes (can be obtained from a partition table)\\n- **Partition Offset**: Starting address of the partition (can be obtained from a partition table)\\n\\nTo pack a folder into a 1-Megabyte image, run::\\n\\n    mkspiffs -c [src_folder] -b 4096 -p 256 -s 0x100000 spiffs.bin\\n\\nTo flash the image onto {IDF_TARGET_NAME} at offset 0x110000, run::\\n\\n    python esptool.py --chip {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME} --port [port] --baud [baud] write_flash -z 0x110000 spiffs.bin\\n\\nNotes on Which SPIFFS Tool to Use\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe two tools presented above offer very similar functionality. However, there are reasons to prefer one over the other, depending on the use case.\\n\\nUse ``spiffsgen.py`` in the following cases:\\n\\n1. If you want to simply generate a SPIFFS image during the build. ``spiffsgen.py`` makes it very convenient by providing functions/commands from the build system itself.\\n2. If the host has no C/C++ compiler available, because ``spiffsgen.py`` does not require compilation.\\n\\nUse ``mkspiffs`` in the following cases:\\n\\n1. If you need to unpack SPIFFS images in addition to image generation. For now, it is not possible with ``spiffsgen.py``.\\n2. If you have an environment where a Python interpreter is not available, but a host compiler is available. Otherwise, a pre-compiled ``mkspiffs`` binary can do the job. However, there is no build system integration for ``mkspiffs`` and the user has to do the corresponding work: compiling ``mkspiffs`` during build (if a pre-compiled binary is not used), creating build rules/targets for the output files, passing proper parameters to the tool, etc.\\n\\nSee Also\\n--------\\n\\n- :doc:`Partition Table documentation <../../api-guides/partition-tables>`\\n\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\nAn example of using SPIFFS is provided in the :example:`storage/spiffs` directory. This example initializes and mounts a SPIFFS partition, then writes and reads data from it using POSIX and C library APIs.

       " 'NVS Encryption\\n==============\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nThis guide provides an overview of the NVS encryption feature. NVS encryption helps to achieve secure storage on the device flash memory.\\n\\nData stored in NVS partitions can be encrypted using XTS-AES in the manner similar to the one mentioned in disk encryption standard IEEE P1619. For the purpose of encryption, each entry is treated as one ``sector`` and relative address of the entry (w.r.t., partition-start) is fed to the encryption algorithm as ``sector-number``.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_HMAC_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    NVS encryption can be facilitated by enabling :ref:`CONFIG_NVS_ENCRYPTION` and :ref:`CONFIG_NVS_SEC_KEY_PROTECTION_SCHEME` > ``CONFIG_NVS_SEC_KEY_PROTECT_USING_FLASH_ENC`` or ``CONFIG_NVS_SEC_KEY_PROTECT_USING_HMAC`` depending on the scheme to be used.\\n\\n\\nNVS Encryption: Flash Encryption-Based Scheme\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn this scheme, the keys required for NVS encryption are stored in yet another partition, which is protected using :doc:`Flash Encryption <../../security/flash-encryption>`. Therefore, enabling :doc:`Flash Encryption <../../security/flash-encryption>` becomes a prerequisite for NVS encryption here.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_HMAC_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    NVS encryption should be enabled when :doc:`../../security/flash-encryption` is enabled because the Wi-Fi driver stores credentials (like SSID and passphrase) in the default NVS partition. It is important to encrypt them if platform-level encryption is already enabled.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_HMAC_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    NVS encryption is enabled by default when :doc:`../../security/flash-encryption` is enabled. This is done because Wi-Fi driver stores credentials (like SSID and passphrase) in the default NVS partition. It is important to encrypt them as default choice if platform-level encryption is already enabled.\\n\\nFor using NVS encryption using this scheme, the partition table must contain the :ref:`nvs_encr_key_partition`. Two partition tables containing the :ref:`nvs_encr_key_partition` are provided for NVS encryption under the partition table option (``menuconfig`` > ``Partition Table``). They can be selected with the project configuration menu (``idf.py menuconfig``). Please refer to the example :example:`security/flash_encryption` for how to configure and use the NVS encryption feature.\\n\\n.. _nvs_encr_key_partition:\\n\\nNVS Key Partition\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAn application requiring NVS encryption support (using the Flash Encryption-based scheme) needs to be compiled with a key-partition of the type ``data`` and subtype ``key``. This partition should be marked as ``encrypted`` and its size should be the minimum partition size (4 KB). Refer to :doc:`../../api-guides/partition-tables` for more details. Two additional partition tables which contain the :ref:`nvs_encr_key_partition` are provided under the partition table option (``menuconfig`` > ``Partition Table``). They can be directly used for NVS encryption. The structure of these partitions is depicted below:\\n\\n.. highlight:: none\\n\\n::\\n\\n    +-----------+--------------+-------------+----+\\n    |              XTS encryption key (32)        |\\n    +---------------------------------------------+\\n    |              XTS tweak key (32)             |\\n    +---------------------------------------------+\\n    |                  CRC32 (4)                  |\\n    +---------------------------------------------+\\n\\nThe XTS encryption keys in the :ref:`nvs_encr_key_partition` can be generated in one of the following two ways.\\n\\n**Generate the keys on {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip itself**\\n\\n    * When NVS encryption is enabled, the :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_init` API function can be used to initialize the encrypted default NVS partition. The API function internally generates the XTS encryption keys on the ESP chip. The API function finds the first :ref:`nvs_encr_key_partition`.\\n\\n    * Then the API function automatically generates and stores the NVS keys in that partition by making use of the :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_generate_keys` API function provided by :component_file:`nvs_flash/include/nvs_flash.h`. New keys are generated and stored only when the respective key partition is empty. The same key partition can then be used to read the security configurations for initializing a custom encrypted NVS partition with help of :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_secure_init_partition`.\\n\\n    * The API functions :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_secure_init` and :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_secure_init_partition` do not generate the keys internally. When these API functions are used for initializing encrypted NVS partitions, the keys can be generated after startup using the :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_generate_keys` API function provided by ``nvs_flash.h``. The API function then writes those keys onto the key-partition in encrypted form.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Please note that ``nvs_keys`` partition must be completely erased before you start the application in this approach. Otherwise the application may generate the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NVS_CORRUPT_KEY_PART` error code assuming that ``nvs_keys`` partition is not empty and contains malformatted data. You can use the following command for this:\\n        ::\\n\\n            parttool.py --port PORT --partition-table-file=PARTITION_TABLE_FILE --partition-table-offset PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET erase_partition --partition-type=data --partition-subtype=nvs_keys\\n\\n**Use a pre-generated NVS key partition**\\n\\n    This option will be required by the user when keys in the :ref:`nvs_encr_key_partition` are not generated by the application. The :ref:`nvs_encr_key_partition` containing the XTS encryption keys can be generated with the help of :doc:`NVS Partition Generator Utility </api-reference/storage/nvs_partition_gen>`. Then the user can store the pre-generated key partition on the flash with help of the following two commands:\\n\\n    1. Build and flash the partition table\\n    ::\\n\\n        idf.py partition-table partition-table-flash\\n\\n    2. Store the keys in the :ref:`nvs_encr_key_partition` (on the flash) with the help of :component_file:`parttool.py <partition_table/parttool.py>` (see Partition Tool section in :doc:`partition-tables </api-guides/partition-tables>` for more details)\\n    ::\\n\\n        parttool.py --port PORT --partition-table-offset PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET write_partition --partition-name=\"name of nvs_key partition\" --input NVS_KEY_PARTITION_FILE\\n\\n    .. note::\\n        If the device is encrypted in flash encryption development mode and you want to renew the NVS key partition, you need to tell :component_file:`parttool.py<partition_table/parttool.py>` to encrypt the NVS key partition and you also need to give it a pointer to the unencrypted partition table in your build directory (build/partition_table) since the partition table on the device is encrypted, too. You can use the following command:\\n        ::\\n\\n            parttool.py --esptool-write-args encrypt --port PORT --partition-table-file=PARTITION_TABLE_FILE --partition-table-offset PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET write_partition --partition-name=\"name of nvs_key partition\" --input NVS_KEY_PARTITION_FILE\\n\\nSince the key partition is marked as ``encrypted`` and :doc:`Flash Encryption <../../security/flash-encryption>` is enabled, the bootloader will encrypt this partition using flash encryption key on the first boot.\\n\\nIt is possible for an application to use different keys for different NVS partitions and thereby have multiple key-partitions. However, it is a responsibility of the application to provide the correct key-partition and keys for encryption or decryption.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_HMAC_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    NVS Encryption: HMAC Peripheral-Based Scheme\\n    --------------------------------------------\\n\\n    In this scheme, the XTS keys required for NVS encryption are derived from an HMAC key programmed in eFuse with the purpose :cpp:enumerator:`esp_efuse_purpose_t::ESP_EFUSE_KEY_PURPOSE_HMAC_UP`. Since the encryption keys are derived at runtime, they are not stored anywhere in the flash. Thus, this feature does not require a separate :ref:`nvs_encr_key_partition`.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        This scheme enables us to achieve secure storage on {IDF_TARGET_NAME} **without enabling flash encryption**.\\n\\n    .. important::\\n\\n        Please take note that this scheme uses one eFuse block for storing the HMAC key required for deriving the encryption keys.\\n\\n    - When NVS encryption is enabled, the :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_init` API function can be used to initialize the encrypted default NVS partition. The API function first checks whether an HMAC key is present at :ref:`CONFIG_NVS_SEC_HMAC_EFUSE_KEY_ID`.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        The valid range for the config :ref:`CONFIG_NVS_SEC_HMAC_EFUSE_KEY_ID` is from ``0`` (:cpp:enumerator:`hmac_key_id_t::HMAC_KEY0`) to ``5`` (:cpp:enumerator:`hmac_key_id_t::HMAC_KEY5`). By default, the config is set to ``6`` (:cpp:enumerator:`hmac_key_id_t::HMAC_KEY_MAX`), which have to be configured before building the user application.\\n\\n    - If no key is found, a key is generated internally and stored at the eFuse block specified at :ref:`CONFIG_NVS_SEC_HMAC_EFUSE_KEY_ID`.\\n    - If a key is found with the purpose :cpp:enumerator:`esp_efuse_purpose_t::ESP_EFUSE_KEY_PURPOSE_HMAC_UP`, the same is used for the derivation of the XTS encryption keys.\\n    - If the specified eFuse block is found to be occupied with a key with a purpose other than :cpp:enumerator:`esp_efuse_purpose_t::ESP_EFUSE_KEY_PURPOSE_HMAC_UP`, an error is thrown.\\n\\n    - The API :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_init` then automatically generates the NVS keys on demand by using the :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_generate_keys_v2` API function provided by the :component_file:`nvs_flash/include/nvs_flash.h`. The same keys can also be used to read the security configurations (see :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_read_security_cfg_v2`) for initializing a custom encrypted NVS partition with help of :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_secure_init_partition`.\\n\\n    - The API functions :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_secure_init` and :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_secure_init_partition` do not generate the keys internally. When these API functions are used for initializing encrypted NVS partitions, the keys can be generated after startup using the :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_generate_keys_v2` API function or take and populate the NVS security configuration structure :cpp:type:`nvs_sec_cfg_t` with :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_read_security_cfg_v2` and feed them into the above APIs.\\n\\n    .. note:: Users can program their own HMAC key in eFuse block beforehand by using the following command:\\n        ::\\n\\n            espefuse.py -p PORT burn_key <BLOCK_KEYN> <hmac_key_file.bin> HMAC_UP\\n\\nEncrypted Read/Write\\n--------------------\\n\\nThe same NVS API functions ``nvs_get_*`` or ``nvs_set_*`` can be used for reading of, and writing to an encrypted NVS partition as well.\\n\\n**Encrypt the default NVS partition**\\n\\n- To enable encryption for the default NVS partition, no additional step is necessary. When :ref:`CONFIG_NVS_ENCRYPTION` is enabled, the :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_init` API function internally performs some additional steps to enable encryption for the default NVS partition depending on the scheme being used (set by :ref:`CONFIG_NVS_SEC_KEY_PROTECTION_SCHEME`).\\n\\n- For the flash encryption-based scheme, the first :ref:`nvs_encr_key_partition` found is used to generate the encryption keys while for the HMAC one, keys are generated using the HMAC key burnt in eFuse at :ref:`CONFIG_NVS_SEC_HMAC_EFUSE_KEY_ID` (refer to the API documentation for more details).\\n\\nAlternatively, :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_secure_init` API function can also be used to enable encryption for the default NVS partition.\\n\\n**Encrypt a custom NVS partition**\\n\\n- To enable encryption for a custom NVS partition, :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_secure_init_partition` API function is used instead of :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_init_partition`.\\n\\n- When :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_secure_init` and :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_secure_init_partition` API functions are used, the applications are expected to follow the steps below in order to perform NVS read/write operations with encryption enabled:\\n\\n    1. Populate the NVS security configuration structure :cpp:type:`nvs_sec_cfg_t`\\n\\n        * For the Flash Encryption-based scheme\\n\\n            - Find key partition and NVS data partition using ``esp_partition_find*`` API functions.\\n            - Populate the :cpp:type:`nvs_sec_cfg_t` struct using the :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_read_security_cfg` or :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_generate_keys` API functions.\\n\\n        .. only:: SOC_HMAC_SUPPORTED\\n\\n            * For the HMAC-based scheme\\n\\n                - Set the scheme-specific config data with :cpp:type:`nvs_sec_config_hmac_t` and register the HMAC-based scheme with the API :cpp:func:`nvs_sec_provider_register_hmac` which will also populate the scheme-specific handle (see :cpp:type:`nvs_sec_scheme_t`).\\n                - Populate the :cpp:type:`nvs_sec_cfg_t` struct using the :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_read_security_cfg_v2` or :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_generate_keys_v2` API functions.\\n\\n            .. code-block:: c\\n\\n                    nvs_sec_cfg_t cfg = {};\\n                    nvs_sec_scheme_t *sec_scheme_handle = NULL;\\n\\n                    nvs_sec_config_hmac_t sec_scheme_cfg = {};\\n                    hmac_key_id_t hmac_key = HMAC_KEY0;\\n                    sec_scheme_cfg.hmac_key_id = hmac_key;\\n\\n                    ret = nvs_sec_provider_register_hmac(&sec_scheme_cfg, &sec_scheme_handle);\\n                    if (ret != ESP_OK) {\\n                        return ret;\\n                    }\\n\\n                    ret = nvs_flash_read_security_cfg_v2(sec_scheme_handle, &cfg);\\n                    if (ret != ESP_OK) {\\n                        if (ret == ESP_ERR_NVS_SEC_HMAC_KEY_NOT_FOUND) {\\n                            ret = nvs_flash_generate_keys_v2(&sec_scheme_handle, &cfg);\\n                            if (ret != ESP_OK) {\\n                                ESP_LOGE(TAG, \"Failed to generate NVS encr-keys!\");\\n                                return ret;\\n                            }\\n                        }\\n                        ESP_LOGE(TAG, \"Failed to read NVS security cfg!\");\\n                        return ret;\\n                    }\\n\\n    2.

       " \"FreeRTOS Overview\\n=================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nFreeRTOS is an open source RTOS (real-time operating system) kernel that is integrated into ESP-IDF as a component. Thus, all ESP-IDF applications and many ESP-IDF components are written based on FreeRTOS. The FreeRTOS kernel is ported to all architectures (i.e., Xtensa and RISC-V) available of ESP chips.\\n\\nFurthermore, ESP-IDF provides different implementations of FreeRTOS in order to support SMP (Symmetric Multiprocessing) on multi-core ESP chips. This document provides an overview of the FreeRTOS component, the different FreeRTOS implementations offered by ESP-IDF, and the common aspects across all implementations.\\n\\nImplementations\\n---------------\\n\\nThe `official FreeRTOS <https://www.freertos.org/index.html>`_ (henceforth referred to as Vanilla FreeRTOS) is a single-core RTOS. In order to support the various multi-core ESP targets, ESP-IDF supports different FreeRTOS implementations as listed below:\\n\\nESP-IDF FreeRTOS\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-IDF FreeRTOS is a FreeRTOS implementation based on Vanilla FreeRTOS v10.5.1, but contains significant modifications to support SMP. ESP-IDF FreeRTOS only supports two cores at most (i.e., dual core SMP), but is more optimized for this scenario by design. For more details regarding ESP-IDF FreeRTOS and its modifications, please refer to the :doc:`freertos_idf` document.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    ESP-IDF FreeRTOS is currently the default FreeRTOS implementation for ESP-IDF.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32p4\\n\\n    .. _amazon_smp_freertos:\\n\\n    Amazon SMP FreeRTOS\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Amazon SMP FreeRTOS is an SMP implementation of FreeRTOS that is officially supported by Amazon. Amazon SMP FreeRTOS is able to support N-cores (i.e., more than two cores). Amazon SMP FreeRTOS can be enabled via the :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_SMP` option. For more details regarding Amazon SMP FreeRTOS, please refer to the `official Amazon SMP FreeRTOS documentation <https://freertos.org/symmetric-multiprocessing-introduction.html>`_.\\n\\n    .. warning::\\n\\n        The Amazon SMP FreeRTOS implementation (and its port in ESP-IDF) are currently in experimental/beta state. Therefore, significant behavioral changes and breaking API changes can occur.\\n\\nConfiguration\\n-------------\\n\\nKernel Configuration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nVanilla FreeRTOS requires that ports and applications configure the kernel by adding various ``#define config...`` macro definitions to the ``FreeRTOSConfig.h`` header file. Vanilla FreeRTOS supports a list of kernel configuration options which allow various kernel behaviors and features to be enabled or disabled.\\n\\n**However, for all FreeRTOS ports in ESP-IDF, the FreeRTOSConfig.h header file is considered private and must not be modified by users**. A large number of kernel configuration options in ``FreeRTOSConfig.h`` are hard-coded as they are either required/not supported by ESP-IDF. All kernel configuration options that are configurable by the user are exposed via menuconfig under ``Component Config/FreeRTOS/Kernel``.\\n\\nFor the full list of user configurable kernel options, see :doc:`/api-reference/kconfig`. The list below highlights some commonly used kernel configuration options:\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE` runs FreeRTOS only on Core 0. Note that this is **not equivalent to running Vanilla FreeRTOS**. Furthermore, this option may affect behavior of components other than :component:`freertos`. For more details regarding the effects of running FreeRTOS on a single core, refer to :ref:`freertos-idf-single-core` (if using ESP-IDF FreeRTOS) or the official Amazon SMP FreeRTOS documentation. Alternatively, users can also search for occurrences of ``CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE`` in the ESP-IDF components.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES\\n\\n    .. note::\\n        As {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is a single core SoC, the :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE` configuration is always set.\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_ENABLE_BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY` enables backward compatibility with some FreeRTOS macros/types/functions that were deprecated from v8.0 onwards.\\n\\nPort Configuration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAll other FreeRTOS related configuration options that are not part of the kernel configuration are exposed via menuconfig under ``Component Config/FreeRTOS/Port``. These options configure aspects such as:\\n\\n- The FreeRTOS ports themselves (e.g., tick timer selection, ISR stack size)\\n- Additional features added to the FreeRTOS implementation or ports\\n\\nUsing FreeRTOS\\n--------------\\n\\nApplication Entry Point\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nUnlike Vanilla FreeRTOS, users of FreeRTOS in ESP-IDF **must never call** :cpp:func:`vTaskStartScheduler` and :cpp:func:`vTaskEndScheduler`. Instead, ESP-IDF starts FreeRTOS automatically. Users must define a ``void app_main(void)`` function which acts as the entry point for user's application and is automatically invoked on ESP-IDF startup.\\n\\n- Typically, users would spawn the rest of their application's task from ``app_main``.\\n- The ``app_main`` function is allowed to return at any point (i.e., before the application terminates).\\n- The ``app_main`` function is called from the ``main`` task.\\n\\n.. _freertos_system_tasks:\\n\\nBackground Tasks\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nDuring startup, ESP-IDF and the FreeRTOS kernel automatically create multiple tasks that run in the background (listed in the the table below).\\n\\n.. list-table:: List of Tasks Created During Startup\\n    :widths: 10 75 5 5 5\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Task Name\\n      - Description\\n      - Stack Size\\n      - Affinity\\n      - Priority\\n    * - Idle Tasks (``IDLEx``)\\n      - An idle task (``IDLEx``) is created for (and pinned to) each core, where ``x`` is the core's number. ``x`` is dropped when single-core configuration is enabled.\\n      - :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_IDLE_TASK_STACKSIZE`\\n      - Core x\\n      - ``0``\\n    * - FreeRTOS Timer Task (``Tmr Svc``)\\n      - FreeRTOS will create the Timer Service/Daemon Task if any FreeRTOS Timer APIs are called by the application\\n      - :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_TIMER_TASK_STACK_DEPTH`\\n      - Core 0\\n      - :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_TIMER_TASK_PRIORITY`\\n    * - Main Task (``main``)\\n      - Task that simply calls ``app_main``.

IPC tasks are used to implement the Inter-processor Call (IPC) feature.\\n      - :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_IPC_TASK_STACK_SIZE`\\n      - Core x\\n      - ``24``\\n    * - ESP Timer Task (``esp_timer``)\\n      - ESP-IDF creates the ESP Timer Task used to process ESP Timer callbacks\\n      - :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TIMER_TASK_STACK_SIZE`\\n      - Core 0\\n      - ``22``\\n\\n.. note::\\n    Note that if an application uses other ESP-IDF features (e.g., Wi-Fi or Bluetooth), those features may create their own background tasks in addition to the tasks listed in the table above.\\n\\nFreeRTOS Additions\\n------------------\\n\\nESP-IDF provides some supplemental features to FreeRTOS such as Ring Buffers, ESP-IDF style Tick and Idle Hooks, and TLSP deletion callbacks. See :doc:`freertos_additions` for more details.\\n\\n.. _freertos-heap:\\n\\nFreeRTOS Heap\\n-------------\\n\\nVanilla FreeRTOS provides its own `selection of heap implementations <https://www.freertos.org/a00111.html>`_. However, ESP-IDF already implements its own heap (see :doc:`/api-reference/system/mem_alloc`), thus ESP-IDF does not make use of the heap implementations provided by Vanilla FreeRTOS. All FreeRTOS ports in ESP-IDF map FreeRTOS memory allocation or free calls (e.g., ``pvPortMalloc()`` and ``pvPortFree()``) to ESP-IDF heap API (i.e., :cpp:func:`heap_caps_malloc` and :cpp:func:`heap_caps_free`). However, the FreeRTOS ports ensure that all dynamic memory allocated by FreeRTOS is placed in internal memory.\\n\\n.. note::\\n    If users wish to place FreeRTOS tasks/objects in external memory, users can use the following methods:\\n\\n    - Allocate the task or object using one of the ``...CreateWithCaps()`` API, such as :cpp:func:`xTaskCreateWithCaps` and :cpp:func:`xQueueCreateWithCaps` (see :ref:`freertos-idf-additional-api` for more details).\\n    - Manually allocate external memory for those objects using :cpp:func:`heap_caps_malloc`, then create the objects from the allocated memory using on of the ``...CreateStatic()`` FreeRTOS functions.\\n\",\n",

When the function is called, execution of the program stops, {IDF_TARGET_CPU_RESET_DES}, the application is loaded by the bootloader and starts execution again.\\n\\nAdditionally, the :cpp:func:`esp_register_shutdown_handler` function can register a routine that will be automatically called before a restart (that is triggered by :cpp:func:`esp_restart`) occurs. This is similar to the functionality of ``atexit`` POSIX function.\\n\\nReset Reason\\n------------\\n\\nESP-IDF applications can be started or restarted due to a variety of reasons. To get the last reset reason, call :cpp:func:`esp_reset_reason` function. See description of :cpp:type:`esp_reset_reason_t` for the list of possible reset reasons.\\n\\nHeap Memory\\n-----------\\n\\nTwo heap-memory-related functions are provided:\\n\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_get_free_heap_size` returns the current size of free heap memory.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_get_minimum_free_heap_size` returns the minimum size of free heap memory that has ever been available (i.e., the smallest size of free heap memory in the application\\'s lifetime).\\n\\nNote that ESP-IDF supports multiple heaps with different capabilities. The functions mentioned in this section return the size of heap memory that can be allocated using the ``malloc`` family of functions.

By default, the Espressif base MAC address is used. This base MAC address is pre-programmed into the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} eFuse in the factory during production.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32s2\\n\\n    .. list-table::\\n        :widths: 20 40 40\\n        :header-rows: 1\\n\\n        * - Interface\\n          - MAC Address (4 universally administered, default)\\n          - MAC Address (2 universally administered)\\n        * - Wi-Fi Station\\n          - base_mac\\n          - base_mac\\n        * - Wi-Fi SoftAP\\n          - base_mac, +1 to the last octet\\n          - :ref:`Local MAC <local-mac-addresses>` (derived from Wi-Fi Station MAC)\\n        * - Bluetooth\\n          - base_mac, +2 to the last octet\\n          - base_mac, +1 to the last octet\\n        * - Ethernet\\n          - base_mac, +3 to the last octet\\n          - :ref:`Local MAC <local-mac-addresses>` (derived from Bluetooth MAC)\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        The :ref:`configuration <CONFIG_{IDF_TARGET_CFG_PREFIX}_UNIVERSAL_MAC_ADDRESSES>` configures the number of universally administered MAC addresses that are provided by Espressif.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s2\\n\\n    .. list-table::\\n        :widths: 20 40 40\\n        :header-rows: 1\\n\\n        * - Interface\\n          - MAC Address (2 universally administered, default)\\n          - MAC Address (1 universally administered)\\n        * - Wi-Fi Station\\n          - base_mac\\n          - base_mac\\n        * - Wi-Fi SoftAP\\n          - base_mac, +1 to the last octet\\n          - :ref:`Local MAC <local-mac-addresses>` (derived from Wi-Fi Station MAC)\\n        * - Ethernet\\n          - :ref:`Local MAC <local-mac-addresses>` (derived from Wi-Fi SoftAP MAC)\\n          - :ref:`Local MAC <local-mac-addresses>` (derived from base_mac with +1 to last octet.

However, this MAC address can only be used with an external ethernet interface such as an SPI-Ethernet device. See :doc:`/api-reference/network/esp_eth`.\\n\\nCustom Interface MAC\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSometimes you may need to define custom MAC addresses that are not generated from the base MAC address. To set a custom interface MAC address, use the :cpp:func:`esp_iface_mac_addr_set` function. This function allows you to overwrite the MAC addresses of interfaces set (or not yet set) by the base MAC address. Once a MAC address has been set for a particular interface, it will not be affected when the base MAC address is changed.\\n\\nCustom Base MAC\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe default base MAC is pre-programmed by Espressif in eFuse {IDF_TARGET_BASE_MAC_BLOCK}. To set a custom base MAC instead, call the function :cpp:func:`esp_iface_mac_addr_set` with the ``ESP_MAC_BASE`` argument (or :cpp:func:`esp_base_mac_addr_set`) before initializing any network interfaces or calling the :cpp:func:`esp_read_mac` function. The custom MAC address can be stored in any supported storage device (e.g., flash, NVS).\\n\\nThe custom base MAC addresses should be allocated such that derived MAC addresses will not overlap. Based on the table above, users can configure the option :ref:`CONFIG_{IDF_TARGET_CFG_PREFIX}_UNIVERSAL_MAC_ADDRESSES` to set the number of valid universal MAC addresses that can be derived from the custom base MAC.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    It is also possible to call the function :cpp:func:`esp_netif_set_mac` to set the specific MAC used by a network interface after network initialization. But it is recommended to use the base MAC approach documented here to avoid the possibility of the original MAC address briefly appearing on the network before being changed.\\n\\n\\nCustom MAC Address in eFuse\\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\\n\\nWhen reading custom MAC addresses from eFuse, ESP-IDF provides a helper function :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_mac_get_custom`. Users can also use :cpp:func:`esp_read_mac` with the ``ESP_MAC_EFUSE_CUSTOM`` argument. This loads the MAC address from eFuse BLK3. The :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_mac_get_custom` function assumes that the custom base MAC address is stored in the following format:\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    .. list-table::\\n        :widths: 20 15 20 45\\n        :header-rows: 1\\n\\n        * - Field\\n          - # of bits\\n          - Range of bits\\n          - Notes\\n        * - Version\\n          - 8\\n          - 191:184\\n          - 0: invalid, others — valid\\n        * - Reserved\\n          - 128\\n          - 183:56\\n          -\\n        * - MAC address\\n          - 48\\n          - 55:8\\n          -\\n        * - MAC address CRC\\n          - 8\\n          - 7:0\\n          - CRC-8-CCITT, polynomial 0x07\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        If the 3/4 coding scheme is enabled, all eFuse fields in this block must be burnt at the same time.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n    .. list-table::\\n        :widths: 30 30 30\\n        :header-rows: 1\\n\\n        * - Field\\n          - # of bits\\n          - Range of bits\\n        * - MAC address\\n          - 48\\n          - 200:248\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        The eFuse BLK3 uses RS-coding during burning, which means that all eFuse fields in this block must be burnt at the same time.\\n\\nOnce custom eFuse MAC address has been obtained (using :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_mac_get_custom` or :cpp:func:`esp_read_mac`), you need to set it as the base MAC address. There are two ways to do it:\\n\\n1. Use an old API: call :cpp:func:`esp_base_mac_addr_set`.\\n2. Use a new API: call :cpp:func:`esp_iface_mac_addr_set` with the ``ESP_MAC_BASE`` argument.\\n\\n\\n.. _local-mac-addresses:\\n\\nLocal Versus Universal MAC Addresses\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} comes pre-programmed with enough valid Espressif universally administered MAC addresses for all internal interfaces. The table above shows how to calculate and derive the MAC address for a specific interface according to the base MAC address.\\n\\nWhen using a custom MAC address scheme, it is possible that not all interfaces can be assigned with a universally administered MAC address. In these cases, a locally administered MAC address is assigned. Note that these addresses are intended for use on a single local network only.\\n\\nSee `this article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address#Universal_vs._local_(U/L_bit)>`_ for the definition of locally and universally administered MAC addresses.\\n\\nFunction :cpp:func:`esp_derive_local_mac` is called internally to derive a local MAC address from a universal MAC address. The process is as follows:\\n\\n1. The U/L bit (bit value 0x2) is set in the first octet of the universal MAC address, creating a local MAC address.\\n2. If this bit is already set in the supplied universal MAC address (i.e., the supplied \"universal\" MAC address was in fact already a local MAC address), then the first octet of the local MAC address is XORed with 0x4.\\n\\nChip Version\\n------------\\n\\n:cpp:func:`esp_chip_info` function fills :cpp:class:`esp_chip_info_t` structure with information about the chip. This includes the chip revision, number of CPU cores, and a bit mask of features enabled in the chip.\\n\\n.. _idf-version-h:\\n\\nSDK Version\\n-----------\\n\\n:cpp:func:`esp_get_idf_version` returns a string describing the ESP-IDF version which is used to compile the application. This is the same value as the one available through ``IDF_VER`` variable of the build system. The version string generally has the format of ``git describe`` output.\\n\\nTo get the version at build time, additional version macros are provided. They can be used to enable or disable parts of the program depending on the ESP-IDF version.\\n\\n* :c:macro:`ESP_IDF_VERSION_MAJOR`, :c:macro:`ESP_IDF_VERSION_MINOR`, :c:macro:`ESP_IDF_VERSION_PATCH` are defined to integers representing major, minor, and patch version.\\n\\n* :c:macro:`ESP_IDF_VERSION_VAL` and :c:macro:`ESP_IDF_VERSION` can be used when implementing version checks:\\n\\n  .. code-block:: c\\n\\n      #include \"esp_idf_version.h\"\\n\\n      #if ESP_IDF_VERSION >= ESP_IDF_VERSION_VAL(4, 0, 0)\\n          // enable functionality present in ESP-IDF v4.0\\n      #endif\\n\\n\\n.. _app-version:\\n\\nApp Version\\n-----------\\n\\nThe application version is stored in :cpp:class:`esp_app_desc_t` structure. It is located in DROM sector and has a fixed offset from the beginning of the binary file. The structure is located after :cpp:class:`esp_image_header_t` and :cpp:class:`esp_image_segment_header_t` structures. The type of the field version is string and it has a maximum length of 32 chars.\\n\\nTo set the version in your project manually, you need to set the ``PROJECT_VER`` variable in the ``CMakeLists.txt`` of your project. In application ``CMakeLists.txt``, put ``set(PROJECT_VER \"0.1.0.1\")`` before including ``project.cmake``.\\n\\nIf the :ref:`CONFIG_APP_PROJECT_VER_FROM_CONFIG` option is set, the value of :ref:`CONFIG_APP_PROJECT_VER` will be used. Otherwise, if the ``PROJECT_VER`` variable is not set in the project, it will be retrieved either from the ``$(PROJECT_PATH)/version.txt`` file (if present) or using git command ``git describe``. If neither is available, ``PROJECT_VER`` will be set to \"1\". Application can make use of this by calling :cpp:func:`esp_app_get_description` or :cpp:func:`esp_ota_get_partition_description` functions.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_system.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_idf_version.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_mac.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_chip_info.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_cpu.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_app_desc.inc\\n',\n",
       " 'ULP Coprocessor Programming\\n=============================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThe Ultra Low Power (ULP) coprocessor is a simple finite state machine (FSM) which is designed to perform measurements using the ADC, temperature sensor, and external I2C sensors, while the main processors are in Deep-sleep mode. The ULP coprocessor can access the ``RTC_SLOW_MEM`` memory region, and registers in the ``RTC_CNTL``, ``RTC_IO``, and ``SARADC`` peripherals. The ULP coprocessor uses fixed-width 32-bit instructions, 32-bit memory addressing, and has 4 general-purpose 16-bit registers. This coprocessor is referred to as ``ULP FSM`` in ESP-IDF.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s2 or esp32s3\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} provides a second type of ULP coprocessor which is based on a RISC-V instruction set architecture. For details regarding `ULP RISC-V` refer :doc:`ULP-RISC-V Coprocessor <../../../api-reference/system/ulp-risc-v>`.\\n\\nInstalling the Toolchain\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe ULP FSM coprocessor code is written in assembly and compiled using the `binutils-esp32ulp toolchain`_.\\n\\nIf you have already set up ESP-IDF with CMake build system according to the :doc:`Getting Started Guide <../../../get-started/index>`, then the ULP FSM toolchain will already be installed.\\n\\nProgramming ULP FSM\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe ULP FSM can be programmed using the supported instruction set. Alternatively, the ULP FSM coprocessor can also be programmed using C Macros on the main CPU. Theses two methods are described in the following section:\\n\\n.. toctree::\\n   :maxdepth: 1\\n\\n   Instruction set reference for {IDF_TARGET_NAME} ULP <ulp_instruction_set>\\n   Programming using macros (legacy) <ulp_macros>\\n\\nCompiling the ULP Code\\n-----------------------\\n\\nTo compile the ULP FSM code as part of the component, the following steps must be taken:\\n\\n1. The ULP FSM code, written in assembly, must be added to one or more files with ``.S`` extension. These files must be placed into a separate directory inside the component directory, for instance, ``ulp/``.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    When registering the component (via ``idf_component_register``), this directory should not be added to the ``SRC_DIRS`` argument. The logic behind this is that the ESP-IDF build system will compile files found in ``SRC_DIRS`` based on their extensions. For ``.S`` files, ``{IDF_TARGET_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX}-as`` assembler is used. This is not desirable for ULP FSM assembly files, so the easiest way to achieve the distinction is by placing ULP FSM assembly files into a separate directory. The ULP FSM assembly source files should also **not** be added to ``SRCS`` for the same reason. See the steps below for how to properly add ULP FSM assembly source files.\\n\\n2. Call ``ulp_embed_binary`` from the component CMakeLists.txt after registration. For example::\\n\\n    ...\\n    idf_component_register()\\n\\n    set(ulp_app_name ulp_${COMPONENT_NAME})\\n    set(ulp_s_sources ulp/ulp_assembly_source_file.S)\\n    set(ulp_exp_dep_srcs \"ulp_c_source_file.c\")\\n\\n    ulp_embed_binary(${ulp_app_name} \"${ulp_s_sources}\" \"${ulp_exp_dep_srcs}\")\\n\\nThe first argument to ``ulp_embed_binary`` specifies the ULP FSM binary name. The name specified here will also be used by other generated artifacts such as the ELF file, map file, header file and linker export file. The second argument specifies the ULP FSM assembly source files. Finally, the third argument specifies the list of component source files which include the header file to be generated. This list is needed to build the dependencies correctly and ensure that the generated header file will be created before any of these files are compiled. See the section below for the concept of generated header files for ULP applications.\\n\\n3. Build the application as usual (e.g., ``idf.py app``).\\n\\n   Inside, the build system will take the following steps to build ULP FSM program:\\n\\n   1. **Run each assembly file (foo.S) through the C preprocessor.** This step generates the preprocessed assembly files (foo.ulp.S) in the component build directory. This step also generates dependency files (foo.ulp.d).\\n\\n   2. **Run preprocessed assembly sources through the assembler.** This produces object (foo.ulp.o) and listing (foo.ulp.lst) files. Listing files are generated for debugging purposes and are not used at later stages of the build process.\\n\\n   3. **Run the linker script template through the C preprocessor.** The template is located in ``components/ulp/ld`` directory.\\n\\n   4. **Link the object files into an output ELF file** (``ulp_app_name.elf``). The Map file (``ulp_app_name.map``) generated at this stage may be useful for debugging purposes.\\n\\n   5. **Dump the contents of the ELF file into a binary** (``ulp_app_name.bin``) which can then be embedded into the application.\\n\\n   6. **Generate a list of global symbols** (``ulp_app_name.sym``) in the ELF file using ``esp32ulp-elf-nm``.\\n\\n   7. **Create an LD export script and a header file** (``ulp_app_name.ld`` and ``ulp_app_name.h``) containing the symbols from ``ulp_app_name.sym``. This is done using the ``esp32ulp_mapgen.py`` utility.\\n\\n   8. **Add the generated binary to the list of binary files** to be embedded into the application.\\n\\nAccessing the ULP FSM Program Variables\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nGlobal symbols defined in the ULP FSM program may be used inside the main program.\\n\\nFor example, the ULP FSM program may define a variable ``measurement_count`` which will define the number of ADC measurements the program needs to make before waking up the chip from Deep-sleep::\\n\\n                            .global measurement_count\\n    measurement_count:      .long 0\\n\\n                            // later, use measurement_count\\n                            move r3, measurement_count\\n                            ld r3, r3, 0\\n\\nThe main program needs to initialize this variable before the ULP program is started. The build system makes this possible by generating the ``${ULP_APP_NAME}.h`` and ``${ULP_APP_NAME}.ld`` files which define the global symbols present in the ULP program. Each global symbol defined in the ULP program is included in these files and are prefixed with ``ulp_``.\\n\\nThe header file contains the declaration of the symbol::\\n\\n    extern uint32_t ulp_measurement_count;\\n\\nNote that all symbols (variables, arrays, functions) are declared as ``uint32_t``. For functions and arrays, take the address of the symbol and cast it to the appropriate type.\\n\\nThe generated linker script file defines the locations of symbols in RTC_SLOW_MEM::\\n\\n    PROVIDE ( ulp_measurement_count = 0x50000060 );\\n\\nTo access the ULP program variables from the main program, the generated header file should be included using an ``include`` statement. This will allow the ULP program variables to be accessed as regular variables::\\n\\n    #include \"ulp_app_name.h\"\\n\\n    // later\\n    void init_ulp_vars() {\\n        ulp_measurement_count = 64;\\n    }\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    Note that the ULP FSM program can only use the lower 16 bits of each 32-bit word in RTC memory, because the registers are 16-bit, and there is no instruction to load from the high part of the word. Likewise, the ULP store instruction writes register values into the lower 16 bits of the 32-bit word in RTC memory. The upper 16 bits are written with a value which depends on the address of the store instruction, thus when reading variables written by the ULP coprocessor, the main application needs to mask the upper 16 bits, e.g.,::\\n\\n        printf(\"Last measurement value: %d\\\\n\", ulp_last_measurement & UINT16_MAX);\\n\\nStarting the ULP FSM Program\\n----------------------------\\n\\nTo run a ULP FSM program, the main application needs to load the ULP program into RTC memory using the :cpp:func:`ulp_load_binary` function, and then start it using the :cpp:func:`ulp_run` function.\\n\\nNote that the ``Enable Ultra Low Power (ULP) Coprocessor`` option must be enabled in menuconfig to work with ULP. To select the type of ULP to be used, the ``ULP Co-processor type`` option must be set. To reserve memory for the ULP, the ``RTC slow memory reserved for coprocessor`` option must be set to a value big enough to store ULP code and data. If the application components contain multiple ULP programs, then the size of the RTC memory must be sufficient to hold the largest one.\\n\\nEach ULP program is embedded into the ESP-IDF application as a binary blob. The application can reference this blob and load it in the following way (suppose ULP_APP_NAME was defined to ``ulp_app_name``)::\\n\\n    extern const uint8_t bin_start[] asm(\"_binary_ulp_app_name_bin_start\");\\n    extern const uint8_t bin_end[]   asm(\"_binary_ulp_app_name_bin_end\");\\n\\n    void start_ulp_program() {\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK( ulp_load_binary(\\n            0 // load address, set to 0 when using default linker scripts\\n            bin_start,\\n            (bin_end - bin_start) / sizeof(uint32_t)) );\\n    }\\n\\nOnce the program is loaded into RTC memory, the application can start it by passing the address of the entry point to the ``ulp_run`` function::\\n\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK( ulp_run(&ulp_entry - RTC_SLOW_MEM) );\\n\\nDeclaration of the entry point symbol comes from the generated header file mentioned above, ``${ULP_APP_NAME}.h``. In the assembly source of the ULP FSM application, this symbol must be marked as ``.global``::\\n\\n\\n            .global entry\\n    entry:\\n            // code starts here\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    ESP32 ULP Program Flow\\n    -----------------------\\n\\n    ESP32 ULP coprocessor is started by a timer. The timer is started once :cpp:func:`ulp_run` is called. The timer counts a number of RTC_SLOW_CLK ticks (by default, produced by an internal 150 kHz RC oscillator). The number of ticks is set using ``SENS_ULP_CP_SLEEP_CYCx_REG`` registers (x = 0..4). When starting the ULP for the first time, ``SENS_ULP_CP_SLEEP_CYC0_REG`` will be used to set the number of timer ticks. Later the ULP program can select another ``SENS_ULP_CP_SLEEP_CYCx_REG`` register using ``sleep`` instruction.\\n\\n    The application can set ULP timer period values (SENS_ULP_CP_SLEEP_CYCx_REG, x = 0..4) using ``ulp_set_wakeup_period`` function.\\n\\n    Once the timer counts the number of ticks set in the selected ``SENS_ULP_CP_SLEEP_CYCx_REG`` register, ULP coprocessor powers up and starts running the program from the entry point set in the call to :cpp:func:`ulp_run`.\\n\\n    The program runs until it encounters a ``halt`` instruction or an illegal instruction. Once the program halts the ULP coprocessor powers down and the timer is started again.\\n\\n    To disable the timer (effectively preventing the ULP program from running again), clear the ``RTC_CNTL_ULP_CP_SLP_TIMER_EN`` bit in the ``RTC_CNTL_STATE0_REG`` register. This can be done both from ULP code and from the main program.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s2 or esp32s3\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} ULP Program Flow\\n    ----------------------------------\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} ULP coprocessor is started by a timer. The timer is started once :cpp:func:`ulp_run` is called. The timer counts a number of RTC_SLOW_CLK ticks (by default, produced by an internal 90 kHz RC oscillator). The number of ticks is set using ``RTC_CNTL_ULP_CP_TIMER_1_REG`` register.\\n\\n    The application can set ULP timer period values by :cpp:func:`ulp_set_wakeup_period` function.\\n\\n    Once the timer counts the number of ticks set in the selected ``RTC_CNTL_ULP_CP_TIMER_1_REG`` register, ULP coprocessor powers up and starts running the program from the entry point set in the call to :cpp:func:`ulp_run`.\\n\\n    The program runs until it encounters a ``halt`` instruction or an illegal instruction. Once the program halts, ULP coprocessor powers down, and the timer is started again.\\n\\n    To disable the timer (effectively preventing the ULP program from running again), clear the ``RTC_CNTL_ULP_CP_SLP_TIMER_EN`` bit in the ``RTC_CNTL_ULP_CP_TIMER_REG`` register. This can be done both from ULP code and from the main program.\\n\\nApplication Examples\\n--------------------\\n\\n* ULP FSM Coprocessor counts pulses on an IO while main CPU is in Deep-sleep: :example:`system/ulp/ulp_fsm/ulp`.\\n* ULP FSM Coprocessor polls ADC in while main CPU is in Deep-sleep: :example:`system/ulp/ulp_fsm/ulp_adc`.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/ulp_fsm_common.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/ulp_common.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/ulp_common_defs.inc\\n\\n.. _binutils-esp32ulp toolchain: https://github.com/espressif/binutils-gdb\\n',\n",

Tracking this value and comparing it to the total free heap allows you to detect heap fragmentation.\\n- :cpp:func:`heap_caps_get_minimum_free_size` can be used to track the heap \"low watermark\" since boot.\\n- :cpp:func:`heap_caps_get_info` returns a :cpp:class:`multi_heap_info_t` structure, which contains the information from the above functions, plus some additional heap-specific data (number of allocations, etc.).\\n- :cpp:func:`heap_caps_print_heap_info` prints a summary of the information returned by :cpp:func:`heap_caps_get_info` to stdout.\\n- :cpp:func:`heap_caps_dump` and :cpp:func:`heap_caps_dump_all` output detailed information about the structure of each block in the heap. Note that this can be a large amount of output.\\n\\n\\n.. _heap-allocation-free:\\n\\nHeap Allocation and Free Function Hooks\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nHeap allocation and free detection hooks allow you to be notified of every successful allocation and free operation:\\n\\n- Providing a definition of :cpp:func:`esp_heap_trace_alloc_hook` allows you to be notified of every successful memory allocation operation\\n- Providing a definition of :cpp:func:`esp_heap_trace_free_hook` allows you to be notified of every successful memory-free operations\\n\\nThis feature can be enabled by setting the :ref:`CONFIG_HEAP_USE_HOOKS` option. :cpp:func:`esp_heap_trace_alloc_hook` and :cpp:func:`esp_heap_trace_free_hook` have weak declarations (e.g., ``__attribute__((weak))``), thus it is not necessary to provide declarations for both hooks. Given that it is technically possible to allocate and free memory from an ISR (**though strongly discouraged from doing so**), the :cpp:func:`esp_heap_trace_alloc_hook` and :cpp:func:`esp_heap_trace_free_hook` can potentially be called from an ISR.\\n\\nIt is not recommended to perform (or call API functions to perform) blocking operations or memory allocation/free operations in the hook functions. In general, the best practice is to keep the implementation concise and leave the heavy computation outside of the hook functions.\\n\\nThe example below shows how to define the allocation and free function hooks:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n  #include \"esp_heap_caps.h\"\\n\\n  void esp_heap_trace_alloc_hook(void* ptr, size_t size, uint32_t caps)\\n  {\\n    ...\\n  }\\n  void esp_heap_trace_free_hook(void* ptr)\\n  {\\n    ...\\n  }\\n\\n  void app_main()\\n  {\\n      ...\\n  }\\n\\n.. _heap-corruption:\\n\\nHeap Corruption Detection\\n-------------------------\\n\\nHeap corruption detection allows you to detect various types of heap memory errors:\\n\\n- Out-of-bound writes & buffer overflows\\n- Writes to freed memory\\n- Reads from freed or uninitialized memory\\n\\nAssertions\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe heap implementation (:component_file:`heap/multi_heap.c`, etc.) includes numerous assertions that will fail if the heap memory is corrupted. To detect heap corruption most effectively, ensure that assertions are enabled in the project configuration via the :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_ASSERTION_LEVEL` option.\\n\\nIf a heap integrity assertion fails, a line will be printed like ``CORRUPT HEAP: multi_heap.c:225 detected at 0x3ffbb71c``. The memory address printed is the address of the heap structure that has corrupt content.\\n\\nIt is also possible to manually check heap integrity by calling :cpp:func:`heap_caps_check_integrity_all` or related functions. This function checks all of the requested heap memory for integrity and can be used even if assertions are disabled. If the integrity checks detects an error, it will print the error along with the address(es) of corrupt heap structures.\\n\\nMemory Allocation Failed Hook\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nUsers can use :cpp:func:`heap_caps_register_failed_alloc_callback` to register a callback that is invoked every time an allocation operation fails.\\n\\nAdditionally, users can enable the :ref:`CONFIG_HEAP_ABORT_WHEN_ALLOCATION_FAILS`, which will automatically trigger a system abort if any allocation operation fails.\\n\\nThe example below shows how to register an allocation failure callback:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n  #include \"esp_heap_caps.h\"\\n\\n  void heap_caps_alloc_failed_hook(size_t requested_size, uint32_t caps, const char *function_name)\\n  {\\n    printf(\"%s was called but failed to allocate %d bytes with 0x%X capabilities. \\\\n\",function_name, requested_size, caps);\\n  }\\n\\n  void app_main()\\n  {\\n      ...\\n      esp_err_t error = heap_caps_register_failed_alloc_callback(heap_caps_alloc_failed_hook);\\n      ...\\n      void *ptr = heap_caps_malloc(allocation_size, MALLOC_CAP_DEFAULT);\\n      ...\\n  }\\n\\nFinding Heap Corruption\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nMemory corruption can be one of the hardest classes of bugs to find and fix, as the source of the corruption could be completely unrelated to the symptoms of the corruption. Here are some tips:\\n\\n- A crash with a ``CORRUPT HEAP:`` message usually includes a stack trace, but this stack trace is rarely useful. The crash is the symptom of memory corruption when the system realizes the heap is corrupt. But usually, the corruption happens elsewhere and earlier in time.\\n- Increasing the heap memory debugging `Configuration`_ level to \"Light impact\" or \"Comprehensive\" gives you a more accurate message with the first corrupt memory address.\\n- Adding regular calls to :cpp:func:`heap_caps_check_integrity_all` or :cpp:func:`heap_caps_check_integrity_addr` in your code helps you pin down the exact time that the corruption happened. You can move these checks around to \"close in on\" the section of code that corrupted the heap.\\n- Based on the memory address that has been corrupted, you can use :ref:`JTAG debugging <jtag-debugging-introduction>` to set a watchpoint on this address and have the CPU halt when it is written to.\\n- If you do not have JTAG, but you do know roughly when the corruption happens, set a watchpoint in software just beforehand via :cpp:func:`esp_cpu_set_watchpoint`. A fatal exception will occur when the watchpoint triggers. The following is an example of how to use the function - ``esp_cpu_set_watchpoint(0, (void *)addr, 4, ESP_WATCHPOINT_STORE)``. Note that watchpoints are per-CPU and are set on the current running CPU only. So if you do not know which CPU is corrupting memory, call this function on both CPUs.\\n- For buffer overflows, `heap tracing`_ in ``HEAP_TRACE_ALL`` mode tells which callers are allocating which addresses from the heap. See `Heap Tracing To Find Heap Corruption`_ for more details. You can try to find the function that allocates memory with an address immediately before the corrupted address, since it is probably the function that overflows the buffer.\\n- Calling :cpp:func:`heap_caps_dump` or :cpp:func:`heap_caps_dump_all` can give an indication of what heap blocks are surrounding the corrupted region and may have overflowed or underflowed, etc.\\n\\nConfiguration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTemporarily increasing the heap corruption detection level can give more detailed information about heap corruption errors.\\n\\nIn the project configuration menu, under ``Component config``, there is a menu ``Heap memory debugging``. The option :ref:`CONFIG_HEAP_CORRUPTION_DETECTION` can be set to one of the following three levels:\\n\\nBasic (No Poisoning)\\n++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nThis is the default level. By default, no special heap corruption features are enabled, but the provided assertions are enabled. A heap corruption error will be printed if any of the heap\\'s internal data structures appear overwritten or corrupted. This usually indicates a buffer overrun or out-of-bounds write.\\n\\nIf assertions are enabled, an assertion will also trigger if a double-free occurs (the same memory is freed twice).\\n\\nCalling :cpp:func:`heap_caps_check_integrity` in Basic mode checks the integrity of all heap structures, and print errors if any appear to be corrupted.\\n\\nLight Impact\\n++++++++++++\\n\\nAt this level, heap memory is additionally \"poisoned\" with head and tail \"canary bytes\" before and after each block that is allocated. If an application writes outside the bounds of allocated buffers, the canary bytes will be corrupted, and the integrity check will fail.\\n\\nThe head canary word is ``0xABBA1234`` (``3412BAAB`` in byte order), and the tail canary word is ``0xBAAD5678`` (``7856ADBA`` in byte order).\\n\\nWith basic heap corruption checks, most out-of-bound writes can be detected and the number of overrun bytes before a failure is detected depends on the properties of the heap. However, the Light Impact mode is more precise as even a single-byte overrun can be detected.\\n\\nEnabling light-impact checking increases the memory usage. Each individual allocation uses 9 to 12 additional bytes of memory depending on alignment.\\n\\nEach time :cpp:func:`heap_caps_free` is called in Light Impact mode, the head and tail canary bytes of the buffer being freed are checked against the expected values.\\n\\nWhen :cpp:func:`heap_caps_check_integrity` is called, all allocated blocks of heap memory have their canary bytes checked against the expected values.\\n\\nIn both cases, the functions involve checking that the first 4 bytes of an allocated block (before the buffer is returned to the user) should be the word ``0xABBA1234``, and the last 4 bytes of the allocated block (after the buffer is returned to the user) should be the word ``0xBAAD5678``.\\n\\nDifferent values usually indicate buffer underrun or overrun. Overrun indicates that when writing to memory, the data written exceeds the size of the allocated memory, resulting in writing to an unallocated memory area; underrun indicates that when reading memory, the data read exceeds the allocated memory and reads data from an unallocated memory area.\\n\\nComprehensive\\n+++++++++++++\\n\\nThis level incorporates the \"light impact\" detection features plus additional checks for uninitialized-access and use-after-free bugs. In this mode, all freshly allocated memory is filled with the pattern ``0xCE``, and all freed memory is filled with the pattern ``0xFE``.\\n\\nEnabling Comprehensive mode has a substantial impact on runtime performance, as all memory needs to be set to the allocation patterns each time a :cpp:func:`heap_caps_malloc` or :cpp:func:`heap_caps_free` completes, and the memory also needs to be checked each time. However, this mode allows easier detection of memory corruption bugs which are much more subtle to find otherwise. It is recommended to only enable this mode when debugging, not in production.\\n\\nCrashes in Comprehensive Mode\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIf an application crashes when reading or writing an address related to ``0xCECECECE`` in Comprehensive mode, it indicates that it has read uninitialized memory. The application should be changed to either use :cpp:func:`heap_caps_calloc` (which zeroes memory), or initialize the memory before using it. The value ``0xCECECECE`` may also be seen in stack-allocated automatic variables, because, in ESP-IDF, most task stacks are originally allocated from the heap, and in C, stack memory is uninitialized by default.\\n\\nIf an application crashes, and the exception register dump indicates that some addresses or values were ``0xFEFEFEFE``, this indicates that it is reading heap memory after it has been freed, i.e., a \"use-after-free bug\". The application should be changed to not access heap memory after it has been freed.\\n\\nIf a call to :cpp:func:`heap_caps_malloc` or :cpp:func:`heap_caps_realloc` causes a crash because it was expected to find the pattern ``0xFEFEFEFE`` in free memory and a different pattern was found, it indicates that the app has a use-after-free bug where it is writing to memory that has already been freed.\\n\\nManual Heap Checks in Comprehensive Mode\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nCalls to :cpp:func:`heap_caps_check_integrity` may print errors relating to ``0xFEFEFEFE``, ``0xABBA1234``, or ``0xBAAD5678``. In each case the checker is expected to find a given pattern, and will error out if not found:\\n\\n- For free heap blocks, the checker expects to find all bytes set to ``0xFE``. Any other values indicate a use-after-free bug where free memory has been incorrectly overwritten.\\n- For allocated heap blocks, the behavior is the same as for the Light Impact mode. The canary bytes ``0xABBA1234`` and ``0xBAAD5678`` are checked at the head and tail of each allocated buffer, and any variation indicates a buffer overrun or underrun.\\n\\n.. _heap-task-tracking:\\n\\nHeap Task Tracking\\n------------------\\n\\nHeap Task Tracking can be used to get per-task info for heap memory allocation. The application has to specify the heap capabilities for which the heap allocation is to be tracked.\\n\\nExample code is provided in :example:`system/heap_task_tracking`.\\n\\n.. _heap-tracing:\\n\\nHeap Tracing\\n------------\\n\\nHeap Tracing allows the tracing of code which allocates or frees memory. Two tracing modes are supported:\\n\\n- Standalone. In this mode, traced data are kept on-board, so the size of the gathered information is limited by the buffer assigned for that purpose, and the analysis is done by the on-board code. There are a couple of APIs available for accessing and dumping collected info.\\n- Host-based. This mode does not have the limitation of the standalone mode, because traced data are sent to the host over JTAG connection using app_trace library. Later on, they can be analyzed using special tools.\\n\\nHeap tracing can perform two functions:\\n\\n- Leak checking: find memory that is allocated and never freed.\\n- Heap use analysis: show all functions that are allocating or freeing memory while the trace is running.\\n\\nHow to Diagnose Memory Leaks\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf you suspect a memory leak, the first step is to figure out which part of the program is leaking memory. Use the :cpp:func:`heap_caps_get_free_size` or related functions in :ref:`heap information <heap-information>` to track memory use over the life of the application. Try to narrow the leak down to a single function or sequence of functions where free memory always decreases and never recovers.\\n\\n\\nStandalone Mode\\n+++++++++++++++\\n\\nOnce you have identified the code which you think is leaking:\\n\\n- Enable the :ref:`CONFIG_HEAP_TRACING_DEST` option.\\n- Call the function :cpp:func:`heap_trace_init_standalone` early in the program, to register a buffer that can be used to record the memory trace.\\n- Call the function :cpp:func:`heap_trace_start` to begin recording all mallocs or frees in the system. Call this immediately before the piece of code which you suspect is leaking memory.\\n- Call the function :cpp:func:`heap_trace_stop` to stop the trace once the suspect piece of code has finished executing.\\n- Call the function :cpp:func:`heap_trace_dump` to dump the results of the heap trace.\\n\\nThe following code snippet demonstrates how application code would typically initialize, start, and stop heap tracing:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n  #include \"esp_heap_trace.h\"\\n\\n  #define NUM_RECORDS 100\\n  static heap_trace_record_t trace_record[NUM_RECORDS]; // This buffer must be in internal RAM\\n\\n  ...\\n\\n  void app_main()\\n  {\\n      ...\\n      ESP_ERROR_CHECK( heap_trace_init_standalone(trace_record, NUM_RECORDS) );\\n      ...\\n  }\\n\\n  void some_function()\\n  {\\n      ESP_ERROR_CHECK( heap_trace_start(HEAP_TRACE_LEAKS) );\\n\\n      do_something_you_suspect_is_leaking();\\n\\n      ESP_ERROR_CHECK( heap_trace_stop() );\\n      heap_trace_dump();\\n      ...\\n  }\\n\\nThe output from the heap trace has a similar format to the following example:\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_XTENSA\\n\\n    .. code-block:: none\\n\\n        2 allocations trace (100 entry buffer)\\n        32 bytes (@ 0x3ffaf214) allocated CPU 0 ccount 0x2e9b7384 caller 0x400d276d:0x400d27c1\\n        0x400d276d: leak_some_memory at /path/to/idf/examples/get-started/blink/main/./blink.c:27\\n\\n        0x400d27c1: blink_task at /path/to/idf/examples/get-started/blink/main/./blink.c:52\\n\\n        8 bytes (@ 0x3ffaf804) allocated CPU 0 ccount 0x2e9b79c0 caller 0x400d2776:0x400d27c1\\n        0x400d2776: leak_some_memory at /path/to/idf/examples/get-started/blink/main/./blink.c:29\\n\\n        0x400d27c1: blink_task at /path/to/idf/examples/get-started/blink/main/./blink.c:52\\n\\n        40 bytes \\'leaked\\' in trace (2 allocations)\\n        total allocations 2 total frees 0\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_RISCV\\n\\n    .. code-block:: none\\n\\n        2 allocations trace (100 entry buffer)\\n        32 bytes (@ 0x3ffaf214) allocated CPU 0 ccount 0x2e9b7384 caller\\n        8 bytes (@ 0x3ffaf804) allocated CPU 0 ccount 0x2e9b79c0 caller\\n        40 bytes \\'leaked\\' in trace (2 allocations)\\n        total allocations 2 total frees 0\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The above example output uses :doc:`IDF Monitor </api-guides/tools/idf-monitor>` to automatically decode PC addresses to their source files and line numbers.\\n\\nThe first line indicates how many allocation entries are in the buffer, compared to its total size.\\n\\nIn ``HEAP_TRACE_LEAKS`` mode, for each traced memory allocation that has not already been freed, a line is printed with:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - ``XX bytes`` is the number of bytes allocated.\\n    - ``@ 0x...`` is the heap address returned from :cpp:func:`heap_caps_malloc` or :cpp:func:`heap_caps_calloc` .\\n    - ``Internal`` or ``PSRAM`` is the general location of the allocated memory.\\n    - ``CPU x`` is the CPU (0 or 1) running when the allocation was made.\\n    - ``ccount 0x...`` is the CCOUNT (CPU cycle count) register value the allocation was made. The value is different for CPU 0 vs CPU 1.\\n    :CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_XTENSA: - ``caller 0x...`` gives the call stack of the call to :cpp:func:`heap_caps_malloc` or :cpp:func:`heap_caps_free` , as a list of PC addresses. These can be decoded to source files and line numbers, as shown above.\\n\\n.. only:: not CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_RISCV\\n\\n    The depth of the call stack recorded for each trace entry can be configured in the project configuration menu, under ``Heap Memory Debugging`` > ``Enable heap tracing`` > :ref:`CONFIG_HEAP_TRACING_STACK_DEPTH`. Up to 32 stack frames can be recorded for each allocation (the default is 2). Each additional stack frame increases the memory usage of each ``heap_trace_record_t`` record by eight bytes.\\n\\nFinally, the total number of the \\'leaked\\' bytes (bytes allocated but not freed while the trace is running) is printed together with the total number of allocations it represents.\\n\\nA warning will be printed if the trace buffer was not large enough to hold all the allocations happened. If you see this warning, consider either shortening the tracing period or increasing the number of records in the trace buffer.\\n\\n\\nHost-Based Mode\\n+++++++++++++++\\n\\nOnce you have identified the code which you think is leaking:\\n\\n- In the project configuration menu, navigate to ``Component settings`` > ``Heap Memory Debugging`` > :ref:`CONFIG_HEAP_TRACING_DEST` and select ``Host-Based``.\\n- In the project configuration menu, navigate to ``Component settings`` > ``Application Level Tracing`` > :ref:`CONFIG_APPTRACE_DESTINATION1` and select ``Trace memory``.\\n- In the project configuration menu, navigate to ``Component settings`` > ``Application Level Tracing`` > ``FreeRTOS SystemView Tracing`` and enable :ref:`CONFIG_APPTRACE_SV_ENABLE`.\\n- Call the function :cpp:func:`heap_trace_init_tohost` early in the program, to initialize the JTAG heap tracing module.\\n- Call the function :cpp:func:`heap_trace_start` to begin recording all memory allocation and free calls in the system. Call this immediately before the piece of code which you suspect is leaking memory.\\n\\n  In host-based mode, the argument to this function is ignored, and the heap tracing module behaves like ``HEAP_TRACE_ALL`` is passed, i.e., all allocations and deallocations are sent to the host.\\n\\n- Call the function :cpp:func:`heap_trace_stop` to stop the trace once the suspect piece of code has finished executing.\\n\\nThe following code snippet demonstrates how application code would typically initialize, start, and stop host-based mode heap tracing:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n  #include \"esp_heap_trace.h\"\\n\\n  ...\\n\\n  void app_main()\\n  {\\n      ...\\n      ESP_ERROR_CHECK( heap_trace_init_tohost() );\\n      ...\\n  }\\n\\n  void some_function()\\n  {\\n      ESP_ERROR_CHECK( heap_trace_start(HEAP_TRACE_LEAKS) );\\n\\n      do_something_you_suspect_is_leaking();\\n\\n      ESP_ERROR_CHECK( heap_trace_stop() );\\n      ...\\n  }\\n\\nTo gather and analyze heap trace, do the following on the host:\\n\\n1.  Build the program and download it to the target as described in :ref:`Step 5. First Steps on ESP-IDF <get-started-build>`.\\n\\n2.  Run OpenOCD (see :doc:`JTAG Debugging </api-guides/jtag-debugging/index>`).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    In order to use this feature, you need OpenOCD version ``v0.10.0-esp32-20181105`` or later.\\n\\n3. You can use GDB to start and/or stop tracing automatically. To do this you need to prepare a special ``gdbinit`` file:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    target remote :3333\\n\\n    mon reset halt\\n    maintenance flush register-cache\\n\\n    tb heap_trace_start\\n    commands\\n    mon esp sysview start file:///tmp/heap.svdat\\n    c\\n    end\\n\\n    tb heap_trace_stop\\n    commands\\n    mon esp sysview stop\\n    end\\n\\n    c\\n\\nUsing this file GDB can connect to the target, reset it, and start tracing when the program hits breakpoint at :cpp:func:`heap_trace_start`. Tracing will be stopped when the program hits breakpoint at :cpp:func:`heap_trace_stop`. Traced data will be saved to ``/tmp/heap_log.svdat``.\\n\\n4. Run GDB using ``{IDF_TARGET_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX}-gdb -x gdbinit </path/to/program/elf>``.\\n\\n5. Quit GDB when the program stops at :cpp:func:`heap_trace_stop`. Traced data are saved in ``/tmp/heap.svdat``.\\n\\n6. Run processing script ``$IDF_PATH/tools/esp_app_trace/sysviewtrace_proc.py -p -b </path/to/program/elf> /tmp/heap_log.svdat``.\\n\\nThe output from the heap trace has a similar format to the following example:\\n\\n.. code-block::\\n\\n  Parse trace from \\'/tmp/heap.svdat\\'...\\n  Stop parsing trace. (Timeout 0.000000 sec while reading 1 bytes!)\\n  Process events from \\'[\\'/tmp/heap.svdat\\']\\'...\\n  [0.002244575] HEAP: Allocated 1 bytes @ 0x3ffaffd8 from task \"alloc\" on core 0 by:\\n

leaked bytes in 4 blocks.\\n\\nHeap Tracing To Find Heap Corruption\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nHeap tracing can also be used to help track down heap corruption. When a region in the heap is corrupted, it may be from some other part of the program that allocated memory at a nearby address.\\n\\nIf you have an approximate idea of when the corruption occurred, enabling heap tracing in ``HEAP_TRACE_ALL`` mode allows you to record all the memory allocation functions used and the corresponding allocation addresses.\\n\\nUsing heap tracing in this way is very similar to memory leak detection as described above. For memories that are allocated and not freed, the output is the same. However, records will also be shown for memory that has been freed.\\n\\nPerformance Impact\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nEnabling heap tracing in menuconfig increases the code size of your program, and has a very small negative impact on the performance of heap allocation or free operations even when heap tracing is not running.\\n\\nWhen heap tracing is running, heap allocation or free operations are substantially slower than when heap tracing is stopped. Increasing the depth of stack frames recorded for each allocation (see above) also increases this performance impact.\\n\\nTo mitigate the performance loss when the heap tracing is enabled and active, enable :ref:`CONFIG_HEAP_TRACE_HASH_MAP`. With this configuration enabled, a hash map mechanism will be used to handle the heap trace records, thus considerably decreasing the heap allocation or free execution time. The size of the hash map can be modified by setting the value of :ref:`CONFIG_HEAP_TRACE_HASH_MAP_SIZE`.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPIRAM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n  By default, the hash map is placed into internal RAM. It can also be placed into external RAM if :ref:`CONFIG_HEAP_TRACE_HASH_MAP_IN_EXT_RAM` is enabled. In order to enable this configuration, make sure to enable :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM` and :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_ALLOW_BSS_SEG_EXTERNAL_MEMORY`.\\n\\nFalse-Positive Memory Leaks\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nNot everything printed by :cpp:func:`heap_trace_dump` is necessarily a memory leak. The following cases may also be printed:\\n\\n- Any memory that is allocated after :cpp:func:`heap_trace_start` but freed after :cpp:func:`heap_trace_stop` appears in the leaked dump.\\n- Allocations may be made by other tasks in the system. Depending on the timing of these tasks, it is quite possible that this memory is freed after :cpp:func:`heap_trace_stop` is called.\\n- The first time a task uses stdio - e.g., when it calls :cpp:func:`heap_caps_printf` - a lock, i.e., RTOS mutex semaphore, is allocated by the libc. This allocation lasts until the task is deleted.\\n- Certain uses of :cpp:func:`heap_caps_printf`, such as printing floating point numbers and allocating some memory from the heap on demand. These allocations last until the task is deleted.\\n- The Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and TCP/IP libraries allocate heap memory buffers to handle incoming or outgoing data. These memory buffers are usually short-lived, but some may be shown in the heap leak trace if the data has been received or transmitted by the lower levels of the network during the heap tracing.\\n- TCP connections retain some memory even after they are closed due to the ``TIME_WAIT`` state. Once the ``TIME_WAIT`` period is completed, this memory will be freed.\\n\\nOne way to differentiate between \"real\" and \"false positive\" memory leaks is to call the suspect code multiple times while tracing is running, and look for patterns (multiple matching allocations) in the heap trace output.\\n\\nAPI Reference - Heap Tracing\\n----------------------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_heap_trace.inc\\n',\n",
       " 'Watchdogs\\n=========\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nESP-IDF supports multiple types of watchdogs:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - Hardware Watchdog Timers\\n    - Interrupt Watchdog Timer (IWDT)\\n    - Task Watchdog Timer (TWDT)\\n    :SOC_XT_WDT_SUPPORTED: - XTAL32K Watchdog Timer (Crystal 32K Watchdog Timer, i.e., XTWDT)\\n\\nThe Interrupt Watchdog is responsible for ensuring that ISRs (Interrupt Service Routines) are not blocked for a prolonged period of time. The TWDT is responsible for detecting instances of tasks running without yielding for a prolonged period.\\n\\nThe various watchdog timers can be enabled using the :ref:`project-configuration-menu`. However, the TWDT can also be enabled during runtime.\\n\\n.. _app-hardware-watchdog-timers:\\n\\nHardware Watchdog Timers\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe chips have two groups of watchdog timers:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    :not esp32c2: - Main System Watchdog Timer (MWDT_WDT) - used by Interrupt Watchdog Timer (IWDT) and Task Watchdog Timer (TWDT).\\n    :esp32c2: - Main System Watchdog Timer (MWDT_WDT) - used by Interrupt Watchdog Timer (IWDT).\\n    - RTC Watchdog Timer (RTC_WDT) - used to track the boot time from power-up until the user\\'s main function (by default RTC Watchdog is disabled immediately before the user\\'s main function).\\n\\nRefer to the :ref:`bootloader-watchdog` section to understand how watchdogs are utilized in the bootloader.\\n\\nThe app\\'s behaviour can be adjusted so the RTC Watchdog remains enabled after app startup. The Watchdog would need to be explicitly reset (i.e., fed) or disabled by the app to avoid the chip reset. To do this, set the :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_WDT_DISABLE_IN_USER_CODE` option, modify the app as needed, and then recompile the app. In this case, the following APIs should be used:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - :cpp:func:`wdt_hal_disable`: see :ref:`hw-abstraction-hal-layer-disable-rtc-wdt`\\n    - :cpp:func:`wdt_hal_feed`: see :ref:`hw-abstraction-hal-layer-feed-rtc-wdt`\\n    :esp32 or esp32s2: - :cpp:func:`rtc_wdt_feed`\\n    :esp32 or esp32s2: - :cpp:func:`rtc_wdt_disable`\\n\\nIf RTC_WDT is not reset/disabled in time, the chip will be automatically reset. See :ref:`RTC-Watchdog-Timeout` for more information.\\n\\nInterrupt Watchdog Timer (IWDT)\\n-------------------------------\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_IWDT_TIMER_GROUP:default=\"Timer Group 1\", esp32c2=\"Timer Group 0\"}\\n\\nThe purpose of the IWDT is to ensure that interrupt service routines (ISRs) are not blocked from running for a prolonged period of time (i.e., the IWDT timeout period). Preventing ISRs from running in a timely manner is undesirable as it can increase ISR latency, and also prevent task switching (as task switching is executed form an ISR). The things that can block ISRs from running include:\\n\\n- Disabling interrupts\\n- Critical Sections (also disables interrupts)\\n- Other same/higher priority ISRs which block same/lower priority ISRs from running\\n\\nThe IWDT utilizes the MWDT_WDT watchdog timer in {IDF_TARGET_IWDT_TIMER_GROUP} as its underlying hardware timer and leverages the FreeRTOS tick interrupt on each CPU to feed the watchdog timer. If the tick interrupt on a particular CPU is not run at within the IWDT timeout period, it is indicative that something is blocking ISRs from being run on that CPU (see the list of reasons above).\\n\\nWhen the IWDT times out, the default action is to invoke the panic handler and display the panic reason as ``Interrupt wdt timeout on CPU0`` or ``Interrupt wdt timeout on CPU1`` (as applicable). Depending on the panic handler\\'s configured behavior (see :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_PANIC`), users can then debug the source of the IWDT timeout (via the backtrace, OpenOCD, gdbstub etc) or simply reset the chip (which may be preferred in a production environment).\\n\\nIf for whatever reason the panic handler is unable to run after an IWDT timeout, the IWDT has a second stage timeout that will hard-reset the chip (i.e., a system reset).\\n\\nConfiguration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- The IWDT is enabled by default via the :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_INT_WDT` option.\\n- The IWDT\\'s timeout is configured by setting the :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_INT_WDT_TIMEOUT_MS` option.\\n\\n    - Note that the default timeout is higher if PSRAM support is enabled, as a critical section or interrupt routine that accesses a large amount of PSRAM takes longer to complete in some circumstances.\\n    - The timeout should always at least twice longer than the period between FreeRTOS ticks (see :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_HZ`).\\n\\nTuning\\n^^^^^^\\n\\nIf you find the IWDT timeout is triggered because an interrupt or critical section is running longer than the timeout period, consider rewriting the code:\\n\\n- Critical sections should be made as short as possible. Any non-critical code/computation should be placed outside the critical section.\\n- Interrupt handlers should also perform the minimum possible amount of computation. Users can consider deferring any computation to a task by having the ISR push data to a task using queues.\\n\\nNeither critical sections or interrupt handlers should ever block waiting for another event to occur. If changing the code to reduce the processing time is not possible or desirable, it is possible to increase the :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_INT_WDT_TIMEOUT_MS` setting instead.\\n\\n.. _task-watchdog-timer:\\n\\nTask Watchdog Timer (TWDT)\\n--------------------------\\n\\nThe Task Watchdog Timer (TWDT) is used to monitor particular tasks, ensuring that they are able to execute within a given timeout period. The TWDT primarily watches the Idle Tasks of each CPU, however any task can subscribe to be watched by the TWDT. By watching the Idle Tasks of each CPU, the TWDT can detect instances of tasks running for a prolonged period of time without yielding. This can be an indicator of poorly written code that spinloops on a peripheral, or a task that is stuck in an infinite loop.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32c2\\n\\n    The TWDT is built around the MWDT_WDT watchdog timer in Timer Group 0. When a timeout occurs, an interrupt is triggered.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c2\\n\\n    The {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has only a single Timer Group, used by Interrupt Watchdog (IWDT). Thus, the Task Watchdog is built around the ``esp_timer`` component in order to implement a software timer. When a timeout occurs, an interrupt is triggered, notifying the ``esp_timer``\\'s main task. The latter then executes the TWDT callback previously registered.\\n\\nUsers can define the function ``esp_task_wdt_isr_user_handler`` in the user code, in order to receive the timeout event and extend the default behavior.\\n\\n\\nUsage\\n^^^^^\\n\\nThe following functions can be used to watch tasks using the TWDT:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_task_wdt_init` to initialize the TWDT and subscribe the idle tasks.\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_task_wdt_add` subscribes other tasks to the TWDT.\\n- Once subscribed, :cpp:func:`esp_task_wdt_reset` should be called from the task to feed the TWDT.\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_task_wdt_delete()` unsubscribes a previously subscribed task.\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_task_wdt_deinit()` unsubscribes the idle tasks and deinitializes the TWDT.\\n\\n\\nIn the case where applications need to watch at a more granular level (i.e., ensure that a particular functions/stub/code-path is called), the TWDT allows subscription of ``users``.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_task_wdt_add_user` to subscribe an arbitrary user of the TWDT. This function returns a user handle to the added user.\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_task_wdt_reset_user` must be called using the user handle in order to prevent a TWDT timeout.\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_task_wdt_delete_user` unsubscribes an arbitrary user of the TWDT.\\n\\nConfiguration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe default timeout period for the TWDT is set using config item :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_TIMEOUT_S`. This should be set to at least as long as you expect any single task needs to monopolize the CPU (for example, if you expect the app will do a long intensive calculation and should not yield to other tasks). It is also possible to change this timeout at runtime by calling :cpp:func:`esp_task_wdt_init`.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Erasing large flash areas can be time consuming and can cause a task to run continuously, thus triggering a TWDT timeout. The following two methods can be used to avoid this:\\n\\n    - Increase :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_TIMEOUT_S` in menuconfig for a larger watchdog timeout period.\\n    - You can also call :cpp:func:`esp_task_wdt_init` to increase the watchdog timeout period before erasing a large flash area.\\n\\n    For more information, you can refer to :doc:`../peripherals/spi_flash/index`.\\n\\nThe following config options control TWDT configuration. They are all enabled by default:\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_IDLE_TASK:default=\"Idle task\", esp32=\"CPU0 Idle task\", esp32s3=\"CPU0 Idle task\", esp32p4=\"CPU0 Idle task\"}\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_EN` - enables TWDT feature. If this option is disabled, TWDT cannot be used, even if initialized at runtime.\\n    - :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_INIT` - the TWDT is initialized automatically during startup. If this option is disabled, it is still possible to initialize the Task WDT at runtime by calling :cpp:func:`esp_task_wdt_init`.\\n    - :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_CHECK_IDLE_TASK_CPU0` - {IDF_TARGET_IDLE_TASK} is subscribed to the TWDT during startup. If this option is disabled, it is still possible to subscribe the idle task by calling :cpp:func:`esp_task_wdt_init` again.\\n    :SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES: - :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_CHECK_IDLE_TASK_CPU1` - CPU1 Idle task is subscribed to the TWDT during startup.\\n\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    On a TWDT timeout the default behaviour is to simply print a warning and a backtrace before continuing running the app. If you want a timeout to cause a panic and a system reset then this can be configured through :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_PANIC`.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_XT_WDT_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    XTAL32K Watchdog Timer (XTWDT)\\n    ------------------------------\\n\\n    One of the optional clock inputs to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is an external 32 kHz crystal oscillator (XTAL32K) that is used as a clock source (``XTAL32K_CLK``) to various subsystems (such as the RTC).\\n\\n    The XTWDT is a dedicated watchdog timer used to ensure that the XTAL32K is functioning correctly. When ``XTAL32K_CLK`` works as the clock source of ``RTC_SLOW_CLK`` and stops oscillating, the XTWDT will detect this and generate an interrupt. It also provides functionality for automatically switching over to the internal, but less accurate oscillator as the ``RTC_SLOW_CLK`` source.\\n\\n    Since the switch to the backup clock is done in hardware it can also happen during Deep Sleep. This means that even if ``XTAL32K_CLK`` stops functioning while the chip is in Deep Sleep, waiting for a timer to expire, it is still able to wake-up as planned.\\n\\n    If the ``XTAL32K_CLK`` starts functioning normally again, you can call ``esp_xt_wdt_restore_clk`` to switch back to this clock source and re-enable the watchdog timer.\\n\\n    Configuration\\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\n    - When the external 32 KHz crystal or oscillator is selected (:ref:`CONFIG_RTC_CLK_SRC`) the XTWDT can be enabled via the :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_XT_WDT` configuration option.\\n    - The timeout is configured by setting the :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_XT_WDT_TIMEOUT` option.\\n    - The automatic backup clock functionality is enabled via the ref:`CONFIG_ESP_XT_WDT_BACKUP_CLK_ENABLE` configuration option.\\n\\n\\nJTAG & Watchdogs\\n----------------\\n\\nWhile debugging using OpenOCD, the CPUs are halted every time a breakpoint is reached. However if the watchdog timers continue to run when a breakpoint is encountered, they will eventually trigger a reset making it very difficult to debug code. Therefore OpenOCD will disable the hardware timers of both the interrupt and task watchdogs at every breakpoint. Moreover, OpenOCD will not reenable them upon leaving the breakpoint. This means that interrupt watchdog and task watchdog functionality will essentially be disabled. No warnings or panics from either watchdogs will be generated when the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is connected to OpenOCD via JTAG.\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\nTask Watchdog\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nA full example using the Task Watchdog is available in esp-idf: :example:`system/task_watchdog`\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_task_wdt.inc\\n',\n",

The contents are as follows:\\n\\n    .. contents::\\n        :local:\\n        :depth: 2\\n\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nThe ESP Timer feature allows for creating software timers and invoking their callback functions (dispatching callbacks) on timeout. ESP Timer is useful when user software needs to perform delayed or periodic actions, such as delayed device start/stop or periodic sampling of sensor data.\\n\\nESP Timer hides the complexity associated with managing multiple timers, dispatching callbacks, accounting for clock frequency changes (if dynamic frequency scaling is enabled), and maintaining correct time after light sleep.\\n\\nFor application scenarios that require better real-time performance (such as generating waveforms) or configurable timer resolution, it is recommended that :doc:`GPTimer </api-reference/peripherals/gptimer>` be used instead. Also, GPTimer has features not available in ESP Timer, such as event capture.\\n\\nFinally, FreeRTOS has its own software timers. As explained in :ref:`FreeRTOS Timers`, they have much lower resolution compared to ESP Timer, but FreeRTOS timers are portable (non-dependent on ESP-IDF) which might be an advantage in some cases.\\n\\n\\nFeatures and Concepts\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe ESP Timer API provides:\\n\\n- One-shot and periodic timers\\n- Multiple callback dispatch methods\\n- Handling overdue callbacks\\n- Bit range: {IDF_TARGET_HR_TIMER_Resolution} bits\\n- Time resolution: 1 microsecond\\n\\n\\nOne-Shot and Periodic Timers\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nA one-shot timer invokes its callback function only once upon expiration and then stops operation. One-shot timers are useful for single delayed actions, such as turning off a device or reading a sensor after a specified time interval.\\n\\nA periodic timer invokes its callback function upon expiration and restarts itself automatically, resulting in the callback function being invoked at a defined interval until the periodic timer is manually stopped. Periodic timers are useful for repeated actions, such as sampling sensor data, updating display information, or generating a waveform.\\n\\n\\n.. _Callback Methods:\\n\\nCallback Dispatch Methods\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTimer callbacks can be dispatched using the following methods:\\n\\n- Task Dispatch method (default):\\n\\n    - Dispatches timer callbacks from a single high-priority ESP Timer task (esp_timer task (notified by ISR) > callback)\\n    - Suitable for handling timer callbacks that are not time-critical\\n\\n- Interrupt Dispatch method (:cpp:enumerator:`ESP_TIMER_ISR <esp_timer_dispatch_t::ESP_TIMER_ISR>`):\\n\\n    - Dispatches timer callbacks directly from an interrupt handler (ISR > callback)\\n    - Suitable for simple, low-latency timer callbacks which take a few microseconds to run\\n    - Ensures shorter delay between the event and the callback execution\\n    - Not affected by other active tasks\\n\\n\\nTask Dispatch Specifics\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe execution of callbacks in the ESP Timer task is serialized. Thus, when multiple timeouts occur simultaneously, the execution time of one callback will delay the execution of subsequent callbacks. For this reason, it is recommended to keep the callbacks short. If the callback needs to perform more work, the work should be deferred to a lower-priority task using FreeRTOS primitives, such as queues and semaphores.\\n\\nIf other FreeRTOS tasks with higher priority are running, such as an SPI Flash operation, callback dispatching will be delayed until the ESP Timer task has a chance to run.\\n\\nTo maintain predictable and timely execution of tasks, callbacks should never attempt block (waiting for resources) or yield (give up control) operations, because such operations disrupt the serialized execution of callbacks.\\n\\n\\nInterrupt Dispatch Specifics\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nTimers using the Interrupt Dispatch method have their callbacks executed from an interrupt handler. As interrupts can preempt all tasks, the Interrupt Dispatch method offers lower latency. Interrupt dispatched timer callbacks should never attempt to block and should not attempt to trigger a context switch via ``portYIELD_FROM_ISR()``. Instead, the function :cpp:func:`esp_timer_isr_dispatch_need_yield` should be used. The context switch will happen after all ISR dispatch timers are processed.\\n\\nWhile using interrupt dispatched timers, the standard logging or debugging methods, such as ``printf`` should be avoided. To debug an application or display certain information in the console, the ESP-IDF logging macros should be used, such as :c:macro:`ESP_DRAM_LOGI`, :c:macro:`ESP_EARLY_LOGI`, etc. These macros are specifically designed to work in various contexts, including interrupt service routines.\\n\\n\\nObtaining Current Time\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe time passed since the initialization of ESP Timer can be obtained using the convenience function :cpp:func:`esp_timer_get_time`. The initialization happens shortly before the ``app_main`` function is called. This function is fast and has no locking mechanisms that could potentially introduce delays or conflicts. As a result, it can be useful for fine-grained timing, with the accuracy of 1 us, in tasks as well as in ISR routines.\\n\\nUnlike the ``gettimeofday()`` function, :cpp:func:`esp_timer_get_time` has the following specifics:\\n\\n- Upon wakeup from deep sleep, the initialization timer restarts from zero\\n- The returned value has no timezone settings or daylight saving time adjustments\\n\\n\\nSystem Integration\\n------------------\\n\\nThis section mainly covers some aspects of how to optimize the operation of ESP Timer and integrate it with other ESP-IDF features.\\n\\n\\nTimeout Value Limits\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAs callback dispatching can never be instantaneous, the one-shot and periodic timers created with ESP Timer also have timeout value limits. These limits cannot be estimated precisely, because they depend on multiple factors.\\n\\nFor reference, the ESP32 running at 240 MHz and using the Task Dispatch method has the approximate minimum timeout values as follows:\\n\\n* One-shot timers: ~20 us\\n\\n    * If :cpp:func:`esp_timer_start_once` is called, this is the earliest time after which the system will be able to dispatch a callback.\\n\\n* Periodic timers: ~50 us\\n\\n    * Periodic software timers with a smaller timeout value would simply consume most of the CPU time, which is impractical.\\n\\nThe lower the CPU frequency, the higher the minimum timeout values will be. The general guideline is if the required timeout values are in the order of tens of microseconds, the user application needs to undergo thorough testing to ensure stable operation.\\n\\nIf the minimum timeout values slightly exceed the requirements, the Interrupt Dispatch method might offer an improvement.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_PARLIO_SUPPORTED and SOC_RMT_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    For even smaller timeout values, for example, to generate or receive waveforms or do bit banging, the resolution of ESP Timer may be insufficient. In this case, it is recommended to use dedicated peripherals, such as :doc:`GPTimer </api-reference/peripherals/gptimer>` or :doc:`RMT </api-reference/peripherals/rmt>`, and their DMA features if available.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_PARLIO_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    For even smaller timeout values, for example, to generate or receive waveforms or do bit banging, the resolution of ESP Timer may be insufficient. In this case, it is recommended to use dedicated peripherals, such as :doc:`Parallel IO </api-reference/peripherals/parlio>`, and their DMA features if available.\\n\\n\\nSleep Mode Considerations\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf a timer is started, and there are no other tasks being executed during the wait time, the chip can be put into sleep to optimize power consumption.\\n\\nSleep can be induced in the following ways:\\n\\n* **Automatic sleep** provided by :doc:`Power Management APIs <power_management>`: If no tasks are being executed, the chip can automatically enter light sleep and automatically wake up at the appropriate time for ESP Timer to dispatch a pending callback.\\n* **Manual sleep** provided by :doc:`Sleep Mode APIs <sleep_modes>`: The chip can be put into sleep regardless of whether other tasks are being executed.\\n\\nFor manually induced sleep, the following sleep modes exist:\\n\\n* Deep-sleep mode: ESP Timer is deactivated\\n\\n  The user application restarts from scratch upon wakeup from deep sleep. This makes deep sleep unsuitable for continuous ESP Timer operation. However, deep sleep can be used if the running timers are not expected to persist across wakeups.\\n\\n* Light-sleep mode: ESP Timer is suspended\\n\\n  While in light sleep, ESP Timer counter and callbacks are suspended. Timekeeping is done by the RTC timer. Once the chip is woken up, the counter of ESP Timer is automatically advanced by the amount of time spent in sleep, then timekeeping and callback execution is resumed.\\n\\n  At this point, ESP Timer will attempt to dispatch all unhandled callbacks if there are any. It can potentially lead to the overflow of ESP Timer callback execution queue. This behavior may be undesirable for certain applications, and the ways to avoid it are covered in :ref:`Handling Callbacks in Light Sleep`.\\n\\n\\n.. _FreeRTOS Timers:\\n\\nFreeRTOS Timers\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAlthough FreeRTOS provides `software timers <https://www.freertos.org/RTOS-software-timer.html>`_, they have limitations:\\n\\n- FreeRTOS timer resolution is bound by the `tick frequency <https://www.freertos.org/a00110.html#configTICK_RATE_HZ>`_, which is typically in the range of 100 to 1000 Hz.\\n- Timer callbacks are dispatched from a low-priority timer task that can be preempted by other tasks, leading to decreased timer precision and accuracy.\\n\\nHowever, FreeRTOS timers are portable (non-dependent on ESP-IDF) and are written to be deterministic as they do not dispatch callbacks from ISRs.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_ETM_SUPPORTED and SOC_SYSTIMER_SUPPORT_ETM\\n\\n    ETM Events\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    ESP Timer has connection to the :doc:`Event Task Matrix </api-reference/peripherals/etm>` (ETM) module. This module allows notifying a number of peripherals about events without involving CPU interrupts. Direct notifications reduce latency and decrease CPU workload. The function :cpp:func:`esp_timer_new_etm_alarm_event` can be called to get the corresponding ETM event handle.\\n\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\nWhile setting up your ESP-IDF project, make sure to:\\n\\n- Add required component dependencies to your ``CMakeLists.txt``.\\n- Include required header files in your ``.c`` files.\\n- (Optional) Set Kconfig options. For this, see :ref:`Kconfig Options <component-config-esp-timer-high-resolution-timer->` > *ESP Timer (High Resolution Timer)*\\n\\n\\n.. _General Procedure:\\n\\nGeneral Procedure\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe general procedure to create, start, stop, and delete a timer is as follows:\\n\\n1. Create a timer\\n\\n    - Define a timer handle using the type :cpp:type:`esp_timer_handle_t`\\n    - Set the timer configuration parameters by defining the structure :cpp:struct:`esp_timer_create_args_t` which also includes the callback function\\n\\n      .. note::\\n\\n          It is recommended to keep callbacks as short as possible to avoid delaying other callbacks.\\n\\n    - To create a timer, call the function :cpp:func:`esp_timer_create`\\n\\n2. Start the timer in one-shot mode or periodic mode depending on your requirements\\n\\n    - To start the timer in one-shot mode, call :cpp:func:`esp_timer_start_once`\\n    - To start the timer in periodic mode, call :cpp:func:`esp_timer_start_periodic`; the timer will continue running until you explicitly stop it using :cpp:func:`esp_timer_stop`\\n\\n    .. note:: When executing a start function, ensure that the timer is not running. If a timer is running, either call :cpp:func:`esp_timer_restart` or stop it first using :cpp:func:`esp_timer_stop` and then call one of the start functions.\\n\\n3. Stop the timer\\n\\n    - To stop the running timer, call the function :cpp:func:`esp_timer_stop`\\n\\n4. Delete the timer\\n\\n    - When the timer is no longer needed, delete it to free up memory using the function :cpp:func:`esp_timer_delete`\\n\\n\\n.. _Using ESP_TIMER_ISR Callback Method:\\n\\nUsing the Interrupt Dispatch Method\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nOut of the available :ref:`callback methods <Callback Methods>`, if you choose the Interrupt Dispatch method, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Set Kconfig options\\n\\n    - Enable :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TIMER_SUPPORTS_ISR_DISPATCH_METHOD`\\n\\n2. Create a timer\\n\\n    - Set the timer configuration parameters by defining the structure :cpp:struct:`esp_timer_create_args_t`\\n\\n      .. code-block:: c\\n\\n          const esp_timer_create_args_t timer = {\\n            ... ,\\n            .dispatch_method = ESP_TIMER_ISR,\\n            ...\\n          };\\n    - To create a timer, call the function :cpp:func:`esp_timer_create`\\n\\nFor further steps, refer to :ref:`General Procedure`.\\n\\n\\n.. _Handling Callbacks in Light Sleep:\\n\\nHandling Callbacks in Light-sleep Mode\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nLight sleep allows you to save power while maintaining the ability to quickly wake up for specific actions. To use ESP Timer in conjunction with Light-sleep mode, see :doc:`Sleep Mode APIs <sleep_modes>`.\\n\\nDuring light sleep, to keep unhandled callbacks under control and avoid potential overflow of ESP Timer callback execution queue on wakeup, do one of the following:\\n\\n- Prevent the invocation of callbacks in the first place: stop the timer before entering light sleep by using :cpp:func:`esp_timer_stop`.\\n- If calling the stop function is not desirable for any reason, use the option :cpp:member:`esp_timer_create_args_t::skip_unhandled_events`. In this case, if a periodic timer expires one or more times during light sleep, then only one callback is executed on wakeup.\\n\\n\\nDebugging Timers\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe function :cpp:func:`esp_timer_dump` allows dumping information about either all or only running timers: the parameters for timers, the number of times the timers were started, triggered, skipped, and time taken by timer callbacks to execute. This information can be helpful in debugging.\\n\\nTo debug timers, use the following procedure:\\n\\n1. Set Kconfig options for more detailed output:\\n\\n    - Enable :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TIMER_PROFILING`\\n\\n    Note that enabling this option increases code size and heap memory usage.\\n\\n2. Wherever required in your code, call the function :cpp:func:`esp_timer_dump` to print the information and use it to debug your timers.\\n\\n3. Once debugging is complete, consider disabling :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TIMER_PROFILING`.\\n\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\n---------------\\n\\nUnstable Callback Dispatch Time\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhile dispatching the same callback function repeatedly, if the response time varies considerably, try to stabilize it by doing the following:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - Use the :ref:`ESP_TIMER_ISR callback method <Using ESP_TIMER_ISR Callback Method>`\\n    :SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES: - Use the Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TIMER_TASK_AFFINITY` to run the ESP Timer task on both cores\\n\\n\\nSignificant Delays Dispatching Callbacks\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf dispatching a callback function takes a considerable amount of time, the problem can lie in the callback function itself. More precisely, as all callback functions are processed one by one in a single esp_timer task, the delays might be caused by other callback functions earlier in the queue.\\n\\nFor this reason, make sure that all callback functions in your application can execute on their own quickly and without any blocking operations.\\n\\n\\nRepeated Callback Dispatches After Sleep\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf the callback functions are executed repeatedly upon wakeup from sleep, see :ref:`Handling Callbacks in Light Sleep`.\\n\\n\\nStack Overflow While Dispatching Callbacks\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf you see a stack overflow error when executing a callback function, consider reducing the stack usage within your callback function. Alternatively, try increasing the size of the ESP Timer task stack by adjusting :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TIMER_TASK_STACK_SIZE`.\\n\\n\\nApplication Examples\\n--------------------\\n\\n* :example:`system/esp_timer` creates and starts one-shot and periodic software timers, shows how they work with Light-sleep mode, and then stops and deletes the timers\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_timer.inc\\n',\n",

System time can be kept by using either one or both of the hardware timers depending on the application\\'s purpose and accuracy requirements for system time. The two hardware timers are:\\n\\n- **RTC timer**: This timer allows time keeping in various sleep modes, and can also persist time keeping across any resets (with the exception of power-on resets which reset the RTC timer). The frequency deviation depends on the `RTC Timer Clock Sources`_ and affects the accuracy only in sleep modes, in which case the time will be measured at 6.6667 μs resolution.\\n\\n- **High-resolution timer**: This timer is not available in sleep modes and will not persist over a reset, but has greater accuracy. The timer uses the APB_CLK clock source (typically 80 MHz), which has a frequency deviation of less than ±10 ppm. Time will be measured at 1 μs resolution.\\n\\nThe possible combinations of hardware timers used to keep system time are listed below:\\n\\n- RTC and high-resolution timer (default)\\n- RTC\\n- High-resolution timer\\n- None\\n\\nIt is recommended that users stick to the default option as it provides the highest accuracy. However, users can also select a different setting via the :ref:`CONFIG_NEWLIB_TIME_SYSCALL` configuration option.\\n\\n\\n.. _rtc-clock-source-choice:\\n\\nRTC Timer Clock Sources\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe RTC timer has the following clock sources:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - ``Internal {IDF_TARGET_RTC_CLK_FRE} RC oscillator`` (default): Features the lowest Deep-sleep current consumption and no dependence on any external components. However, the frequency stability of this clock source is affected by temperature fluctuations, so time may drift in both Deep-sleep and Light-sleep modes.\\n\\n    :not esp32c2: - ``External 32 kHz crystal``: Requires a 32 kHz crystal to be connected to the {IDF_TARGET_EXT_CRYSTAL_PIN} pins. This source provides a better frequency stability at the expense of a slightly higher (by 1 μA) Deep-sleep current consumption.\\n\\n    - ``External 32 kHz oscillator at {IDF_TARGET_EXT_OSC_PIN} pin``: Allows using 32 kHz clock generated by an external circuit. The external clock signal must be connected to the {IDF_TARGET_EXT_OSC_PIN} pin. The amplitude should be less than 1.2 V for sine wave signal and less than 1 V for square wave signal. Common mode voltage should be in the range of 0.1 < Vcm < 0.5xVamp, where Vamp stands for signal amplitude. In this case, the {IDF_TARGET_EXT_OSC_PIN} pin cannot be used as a GPIO pin.\\n\\n    :not esp32c6 and not esp32h2 and not esp32p4: - ``Internal {IDF_TARGET_INT_OSC_FRE} oscillator, divided by 256 ({IDF_TARGET_INT_OSC_FRE_DIVIDED})``: Provides better frequency stability than the ``Internal {IDF_TARGET_RTC_CLK_FRE} RC oscillator`` at the expense of a higher (by 5 μA) Deep-sleep current consumption. It also does not require external components.\\n\\n    :esp32c6 or esp32h2 or esp32p4: - ``Internal 32 kHz RC oscillator``\\n\\nThe choice depends on your requirements for system time accuracy and power consumption in sleep modes. To modify the RTC clock source, set :ref:`CONFIG_RTC_CLK_SRC` in project configuration.\\n\\nMore details about the wiring requirements for the external crystal or external oscillator, please refer to {IDF_TARGET_HARDWARE_DESIGN_URL}.\\n\\nGet Current Time\\n----------------\\n\\nTo get the current time, use the POSIX function ``gettimeofday()``. Additionally, you can use the following standard C library functions to obtain time and manipulate it:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    gettimeofday\\n    time\\n    asctime\\n    clock\\n    ctime\\n    difftime\\n    gmtime\\n    localtime\\n    mktime\\n    strftime\\n    adjtime*\\n\\nTo stop smooth time adjustment and update the current time immediately, use the POSIX function ``settimeofday()``.\\n\\nIf you need to obtain time with one second resolution, use the following code snippet:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    time_t now;\\n    char strftime_buf[64];\\n    struct tm timeinfo;\\n\\n    time(&now);\\n    // Set timezone to China Standard Time\\n    setenv(\"TZ\", \"CST-8\", 1);\\n    tzset();\\n\\n    localtime_r(&now, &timeinfo);\\n    strftime(strftime_buf, sizeof(strftime_buf), \"%c\", &timeinfo);\\n    ESP_LOGI(TAG, \"The current date/time in Shanghai is: %s\", strftime_buf);\\n\\nIf you need to obtain time with one microsecond resolution, use the code snippet below:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    struct timeval tv_now;\\n    gettimeofday(&tv_now, NULL);\\n    int64_t time_us = (int64_t)tv_now.tv_sec * 1000000L + (int64_t)tv_now.tv_usec;\\n\\n.. _system-time-sntp-sync:\\n\\nSNTP Time Synchronization\\n-------------------------\\n\\nTo set the current time, you can use the POSIX functions ``settimeofday()`` and ``adjtime()``. They are used internally in the lwIP SNTP library to set current time when a response from the NTP server is received. These functions can also be used separately from the lwIP SNTP library.\\n\\nSome lwIP APIs, including SNTP functions, are not thread safe, so it is recommended to use :doc:`esp_netif component <../network/esp_netif>` when interacting with SNTP module.\\n\\nTo initialize a particular SNTP server and also start the SNTP service, simply create a default SNTP server configuration with a particular server name, then call :cpp:func:`esp_netif_sntp_init()` to register that server and start the SNTP service.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    esp_sntp_config_t config = ESP_NETIF_SNTP_DEFAULT_CONFIG(\"pool.ntp.org\");\\n    esp_netif_sntp_init(&config);\\n\\nThis code automatically performs time synchronization once a reply from the SNTP server is received. Sometimes it is useful to wait until the time gets synchronized, :cpp:func:`esp_netif_sntp_sync_wait()` can be used for this purpose:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    if (esp_netif_sntp_sync_wait(pdMS_TO_TICKS(10000)) != ESP_OK) {\\n        printf(\"Failed to update system time within 10s timeout\");\\n    }\\n\\nTo configure multiple NTP servers (or use more advanced settings, such as DHCP provided NTP servers), please refer to the detailed description of :ref:`esp_netif-sntp-api` in :doc:`esp_netif <../network/esp_netif>` documentation.\\n\\nThe lwIP SNTP library could work in one of the following sync modes:\\n\\n- :cpp:enumerator:`SNTP_SYNC_MODE_IMMED` (default): Updates system time immediately upon receiving a response from the SNTP server after using ``settimeofday()``.\\n- :cpp:enumerator:`SNTP_SYNC_MODE_SMOOTH`: Updates time smoothly by gradually reducing time error using the function ``adjtime()``. If the difference between the SNTP response time and system time is more than 35 minutes, update system time immediately by using ``settimeofday()``.\\n\\nIf you want to choose the :cpp:enumerator:`SNTP_SYNC_MODE_SMOOTH` mode, please set the :cpp:member:`esp_sntp_config::smooth` to ``true`` in the SNTP configuration struct. Otherwise (and by default) the :cpp:enumerator:`SNTP_SYNC_MODE_IMMED` mode will be used.\\n\\nFor setting a callback function that is called when time gets synchronized, use the :cpp:member:`esp_sntp_config::sync_cb` field in the configuration struct.\\n\\nAn application with this initialization code periodically synchronizes the time. The time synchronization period is determined by :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_SNTP_UPDATE_DELAY` (the default value is one hour). To modify the variable, set :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_SNTP_UPDATE_DELAY` in project configuration.\\n\\nA code example that demonstrates the implementation of time synchronization based on the lwIP SNTP library is provided in the :example:`protocols/sntp` directory.\\n\\nNote that it is also possible to use lwIP API directly, but care must be taken to thread safety. Here we list the thread-safe APIs:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`sntp_set_time_sync_notification_cb` can be used to set a callback function that notifies of the time synchronization process.\\n- :cpp:func:`sntp_get_sync_status` and :cpp:func:`sntp_set_sync_status` can be used to get/set time synchronization status.\\n- :cpp:func:`sntp_set_sync_mode` can be used to set the synchronization mode.\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_sntp_setoperatingmode` sets the preferred operating mode.:cpp:enumerator:`ESP_SNTP_OPMODE_POLL` and :cpp:func:`esp_sntp_init` initializes SNTP module.\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_sntp_setservername` configures one SNTP server.\\n\\n\\nTimezones\\n---------\\n\\nTo set the local timezone, use the following POSIX functions:\\n\\n1. Call ``setenv()`` to set the ``TZ`` environment variable to the correct value based on the device location. The format of the time string is the same as described in the `GNU libc documentation <https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/TZ-Variable.html>`_ (although the implementation is different).\\n2. Call ``tzset()`` to update C library runtime data for the new timezone.\\n\\nOnce these steps are completed, call the standard C library function ``localtime()``, and it returns the correct local time taking into account the timezone offset and daylight saving time.\\n\\n\\nYear 2036 and 2038 Overflow Issues\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nSNTP/NTP 2036 Overflow\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSNTP/NTP timestamps are represented as 64-bit unsigned fixed point numbers, where the first 32 bits represent the integer part, and the last 32 bits represent the fractional part. The 64-bit unsigned fixed point number represents the number of seconds since 00:00 on 1st of January 1900, thus SNTP/NTP times will overflow in the year 2036.\\n\\nTo address this issue, lifetime of the SNTP/NTP timestamps has been extended by convention by using the MSB (bit 0 by convention) of the integer part to indicate time ranges between years 1968 to 2104 (see `RFC2030 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2030>`_ for more details). This convention is implemented in lwIP library SNTP module. Therefore SNTP-related functions in ESP-IDF are future-proof until year 2104.\\n\\n\\nUnix Time 2038 Overflow\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nUnix time (type ``time_t``) was previously represented as a 32-bit signed integer, leading to an overflow in year 2038 (i.e., `Y2K38 issue <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem>`_). To address the Y2K38 issue, ESP-IDF uses a 64-bit signed integer to represent ``time_t`` starting from release v5.0, thus deferring ``time_t`` overflow for another 292 billion years.\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_sntp.inc\\n',\n",
       " \"Asynchronous Memory Copy\\n========================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} has a DMA engine which can help to offload internal memory copy operations from the CPU in an asynchronous way.\\n\\nThe async memcpy API wraps all DMA configurations and operations. The signature of :cpp:func:`esp_async_memcpy` is almost the same as the standard libc ``memcpy`` function.\\n\\nThe DMA allows multiple memory copy requests to be queued up before the first one is completed, which allows overlap of computation and memory copy. Moreover, it is still possible to know the exact time when a memory copy request is completed by registering an event callback.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_AHB_GDMA_SUPPORT_PSRAM\\n\\n    If the async memcpy is constructed upon the AHB GDMA, it is also possible to copy data from/to PSRAM with a proper alignment.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_AXI_GDMA_SUPPORT_PSRAM\\n\\n    If the async memcpy is constructed upon the AXI GDMA, it is also possible to copy data from/to PSRAM with a proper alignment.\\n\\n\\nConfigure and Install Driver\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThere are several ways to install the async memcpy driver, depending on the underlying DMA engine:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    :SOC_CP_DMA_SUPPORTED: - :cpp:func:`esp_async_memcpy_install_cpdma` is used to install the async memcpy driver based on the CP DMA engine.\\n    :SOC_AHB_GDMA_SUPPORTED: - :cpp:func:`esp_async_memcpy_install_gdma_ahb` is used to install the async memcpy driver based on the AHB GDMA engine.\\n    :SOC_AXI_GDMA_SUPPORTED: - :cpp:func:`esp_async_memcpy_install_gdma_axi` is used to install the async memcpy driver based on the AXI GDMA engine.\\n    - :cpp:func:`esp_async_memcpy_install` is a generic API to install the async memcpy driver with a default DMA engine. If the SoC has the CP DMA engine, the default DMA engine is CP DMA. Otherwise, the default DMA engine is AHB GDMA.\\n\\nDriver configuration is described in :cpp:type:`async_memcpy_config_t`:\\n\\n* :cpp:member:`backlog`: This is used to configure the maximum number of memory copy transactions that can be queued up before the first one is completed. If this field is set to zero, then the default value 4 will be applied.\\n* :cpp:member:`sram_trans_align`: Declare SRAM alignment for both data address and copy size, set to zero if the data has no restriction in alignment. If set to a quadruple value (i.e., 4X), the driver will enable the burst mode internally, which is helpful for some performance related application.\\n* :cpp:member:`psram_trans_align`: Declare PSRAM alignment for both data address and copy size. User has to give it a valid value (only 16, 32, 64 are supported) if the destination of memcpy is located in PSRAM. The default alignment (i.e., 16) will be applied if it is set to zero. Internally, the driver configures the size of block used by DMA to access PSRAM, according to the alignment.\\n* :cpp:member:`flags`: This is used to enable some special driver features.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    async_memcpy_config_t config = ASYNC_MEMCPY_DEFAULT_CONFIG();\\n    // update the maximum data stream supported by underlying DMA engine\\n    config.backlog = 8;\\n    async_memcpy_handle_t driver = NULL;\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_async_memcpy_install(&config, &driver)); // install driver with default DMA engine\\n\\nSend Memory Copy Request\\n------------------------\\n\\n:cpp:func:`esp_async_memcpy` is the API to send memory copy request to DMA engine. It must be called after driver is installed successfully. This API is thread safe, so it can be called from different tasks.\\n\\nDifferent from the libc version of ``memcpy``, you can optionally pass a callback to :cpp:func:`esp_async_memcpy`, so that you can be notified when the memory copy is finished. Note that the callback is executed in the ISR context, please make sure you will not call any blocking functions in the callback.\\n\\nThe prototype of the callback function is :cpp:type:`async_memcpy_isr_cb_t`. The callback function should only return true if it wakes up a high priority task by RTOS APIs like :cpp:func:`xSemaphoreGiveFromISR`.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    // Callback implementation, running in ISR context\\n    static bool my_async_memcpy_cb(async_memcpy_handle_t mcp_hdl, async_memcpy_event_t *event, void *cb_args)\\n    {\\n        SemaphoreHandle_t sem = (SemaphoreHandle_t)cb_args;\\n        BaseType_t high_task_wakeup = pdFALSE;\\n        xSemaphoreGiveFromISR(semphr, &high_task_wakeup); // high_task_wakeup set to pdTRUE if some high priority task unblocked\\n        return high_task_wakeup == pdTRUE;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Create a semaphore used to report the completion of async memcpy\\n    SemaphoreHandle_t semphr = xSemaphoreCreateBinary();\\n\\n    // Called from user's context\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_async_memcpy(driver_handle, to, from, copy_len, my_async_memcpy_cb, my_semaphore));\\n    // Do something else here\\n    xSemaphoreTake(my_semaphore, portMAX_DELAY); // Wait until the buffer copy is done\\n\\n\\nUninstall Driver\\n----------------\\n\\n:cpp:func:`esp_async_memcpy_uninstall` is used to uninstall asynchronous memcpy driver. It is not necessary to uninstall the driver after each memcpy operation. If you know your application will not use this driver anymore, then this API can recycle the memory and other hardware resources for you.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_ETM_SUPPORTED and SOC_GDMA_SUPPORT_ETM\\n\\n    ETM Event\\n    ---------\\n\\n    Async memory copy is able to generate an event when one async memcpy operation is done. This event can be used to interact with the :doc:`ETM </api-reference/peripherals/etm>` module. You can call :cpp:func:`esp_async_memcpy_new_etm_event` to get the ETM event handle.\\n\\n    For how to connect the event to an ETM channel, please refer to the :doc:`ETM </api-reference/peripherals/etm>` documentation.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_async_memcpy.inc\\n\",\n",
       " 'Power Management\\n================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nPower management algorithm included in ESP-IDF can adjust the advanced peripheral bus (APB) frequency, CPU frequency, and put the chip into Light-sleep mode to run an application at smallest possible power consumption, given the requirements of application components.\\n\\nApplication components can express their requirements by creating and acquiring power management locks.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n- Driver for a peripheral clocked from APB can request the APB frequency to be set to 80 MHz while the peripheral is used.\\n- RTOS can request the CPU to run at the highest configured frequency while there are tasks ready to run.\\n- A peripheral driver may need interrupts to be enabled, which means it has to request disabling Light-sleep.\\n\\nSince requesting higher APB or CPU frequencies or disabling Light-sleep causes higher current consumption, please keep the usage of power management locks by components to a minimum.\\n\\nConfiguration\\n-------------\\n\\nPower management can be enabled at compile time, using the option :ref:`CONFIG_PM_ENABLE`.\\n\\nEnabling power management features comes at the cost of increased interrupt latency. Extra latency depends on a number of factors, such as the CPU frequency, single/dual core mode, whether or not frequency switch needs to be done. Minimum extra latency is 0.2 us (when the CPU frequency is 240 MHz and frequency scaling is not enabled). Maximum extra latency is 40 us (when frequency scaling is enabled, and a switch from 40 MHz to 80 MHz is performed on interrupt entry).\\n\\nDynamic frequency scaling (DFS) and automatic Light-sleep can be enabled in an application by calling the function :cpp:func:`esp_pm_configure`. Its argument is a structure defining the frequency scaling settings, :cpp:class:`esp_pm_config_t`. In this structure, three fields need to be initialized:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - ``max_freq_mhz``: Maximum CPU frequency in MHz, i.e., the frequency used when the ``ESP_PM_CPU_FREQ_MAX`` lock is acquired. This field is usually set to the default CPU frequency.\\n\\n    :esp32 or esp32s2: - ``min_freq_mhz``: Minimum CPU frequency in MHz, indicating the frequency used when not holding the power management lock. Note that 10 MHz is the minimum frequency required for generating a 1 MHz REF_TICK default clock.\\n\\n    :not esp32 and not esp32s2: - ``min_freq_mhz``: Minimum CPU frequency in MHz, indicating the frequency used when not holding the power management lock.\\n\\n    - ``light_sleep_enable``: Whether the system should automatically enter Light-sleep when no locks are acquired (``true``/``false``).\\n\\n\\n  Alternatively, if you enable the option :ref:`CONFIG_PM_DFS_INIT_AUTO` in menuconfig, the maximum CPU frequency will be determined by the :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_DEFAULT_CPU_FREQ_MHZ` setting, and the minimum CPU frequency will be locked to the XTAL frequency.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  Automatic Light-sleep is based on FreeRTOS Tickless Idle functionality. If automatic Light-sleep is requested while the option :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_USE_TICKLESS_IDLE` is not enabled in menuconfig, :cpp:func:`esp_pm_configure` will return the error `ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED`.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  In Light-sleep, peripherals are clock gated, and interrupts (from GPIOs and internal peripherals) will not be generated. A wakeup source described in the :doc:`sleep_modes` documentation can be used to trigger wakeup from the Light-sleep state.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_PM_SUPPORT_EXT0_WAKEUP or SOC_PM_SUPPORT_EXT1_WAKEUP\\n\\n  For example, the EXT0 and EXT1 wakeup sources can be used to wake up the chip via a GPIO.\\n\\n\\nPower Management Locks\\n----------------------\\n{IDF_TARGET_MAX_CPU_FREQ: default=\"Not updated yet\", esp32=\"80 MHz, 160 MHz, or 240 MHz\", esp32s2=\"80 MHz, 160 MHz, or 240 MHz\", esp32s3=\"80 MHz, 160 MHz, or 240 MHz\", esp32c2=\"80 MHz or 120 MHz\", esp32c3=\"80 MHz or 160 MHz\", esp32c6=\"80 MHz or 160 MHz\"}\\n\\nApplications have the ability to acquire/release locks in order to control the power management algorithm. When an application acquires a lock, the power management algorithm operation is restricted in a way described below. When the lock is released, such restrictions are removed.\\n\\nPower management locks have acquire/release counters. If the lock has been acquired a number of times, it needs to be released the same number of times to remove associated restrictions.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports three types of locks described in the table below.\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n  :header-rows: 1\\n  :widths: 25 60\\n\\n  * - Lock\\n    - Description\\n  * - ``ESP_PM_CPU_FREQ_MAX``\\n    - Requests CPU frequency to be at the maximum value set with :cpp:func:`esp_pm_configure`. For {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, this value can be set to {IDF_TARGET_MAX_CPU_FREQ}.\\n  * - ``ESP_PM_APB_FREQ_MAX``\\n    - Requests the APB frequency to be at the maximum supported value. For {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, this is 80 MHz.\\n  * - ``ESP_PM_NO_LIGHT_SLEEP``\\n    - Disables automatic switching to Light-sleep.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Power Management Algorithm\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nThe table below shows how CPU and APB frequencies will be switched if dynamic frequency scaling is enabled. You can specify the maximum CPU frequency with either :cpp:func:`esp_pm_configure` or :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_DEFAULT_CPU_FREQ_MHZ`.\\n\\n.. include:: inc/power_management_{IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}.rst\\n\\nIf none of the locks are acquired, and Light-sleep is enabled in a call to :cpp:func:`esp_pm_configure`, the system will go into Light-sleep mode. The duration of Light-sleep will be determined by:\\n\\n- FreeRTOS tasks blocked with finite timeouts\\n- Timers registered with :doc:`High resolution timer <esp_timer>` APIs\\n\\nLight-sleep duration is chosen to wake up the chip before the nearest event (task being unblocked, or timer elapses).\\n\\nTo skip unnecessary wake-up, you can consider initializing an ``esp_timer`` with the ``skip_unhandled_events`` option as ``true``. Timers with this flag will not wake up the system and it helps to reduce consumption.\\n\\n\\nDynamic Frequency Scaling and Peripheral Drivers\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhen DFS is enabled, the APB frequency can be changed multiple times within a single RTOS tick. The APB frequency change does not affect the operation of some peripherals, while other peripherals may have issues. For example, Timer Group peripheral timers keeps counting, however, the speed at which they count changes proportionally to the APB frequency.\\n\\nPeripheral clock sources such as ``REF_TICK``, ``XTAL``, ``RC_FAST`` (i.e., ``RTC_8M``), their frequencies will not be inflenced by APB frequency. And therefore, to ensure the peripheral behaves consistently during DFS, it is recommanded to select one of these clocks as the peripheral clock source. For more specific guidelines, please refer to the \"Power Management\" section of each peripheral\\'s \"API Reference > Peripherals API\" page.\\n\\nCurrently, the following peripheral drivers are aware of DFS and use the ``ESP_PM_APB_FREQ_MAX`` lock for the duration of the transaction:\\n\\n- SPI master\\n- I2C\\n- I2S (If the APLL clock is used, then it will use the ``ESP_PM_NO_LIGHT_SLEEP`` lock)\\n- SDMMC\\n\\nThe following drivers hold the ``ESP_PM_APB_FREQ_MAX`` lock while the driver is enabled:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - **SPI slave**: between calls to :cpp:func:`spi_slave_initialize` and :cpp:func:`spi_slave_free`.\\n    - **GPTimer**: between calls to :cpp:func:`gptimer_enable` and :cpp:func:`gptimer_disable`.\\n    - **Ethernet**: between calls to :cpp:func:`esp_eth_driver_install` and :cpp:func:`esp_eth_driver_uninstall`.\\n    - **WiFi**: between calls to :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_start` and :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_stop`. If modem sleep is enabled, the lock will be released for the periods of time when radio is disabled.\\n    :SOC_TWAI_SUPPORTED: - **TWAI**: between calls to :cpp:func:`twai_driver_install` and :cpp:func:`twai_driver_uninstall` (only when the clock source is set to :cpp:enumerator:`TWAI_CLK_SRC_APB`).\\n    :SOC_BT_SUPPORTED and esp32: - **Bluetooth**: between calls to :cpp:func:`esp_bt_controller_enable` and :cpp:func:`esp_bt_controller_disable`. If Bluetooth Modem-sleep is enabled, the ``ESP_PM_APB_FREQ_MAX`` lock will be released for the periods of time when radio is disabled. However the ``ESP_PM_NO_LIGHT_SLEEP`` lock will still be held, unless :ref:`CONFIG_BTDM_CTRL_LOW_POWER_CLOCK` option is set to \"External 32kHz crystal\".\\n    :SOC_BT_SUPPORTED and not esp32: - **Bluetooth**: between calls to :cpp:func:`esp_bt_controller_enable` and :cpp:func:`esp_bt_controller_disable`. If Bluetooth Modem-sleep is enabled, the ``ESP_PM_APB_FREQ_MAX`` lock will be released for the periods of time when radio is disabled. However the ``ESP_PM_NO_LIGHT_SLEEP`` lock will still be held.\\n\\nThe following peripheral drivers are not aware of DFS yet. Applications need to acquire/release locks themselves, when necessary:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - PCNT\\n    - Sigma-delta\\n    - The legacy timer group driver\\n    :SOC_MCPWM_SUPPORTED: - MCPWM\\n\\n\\nLight-sleep Peripheral Power Down\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c6 or esp32h2\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports power-down peripherals during Light-sleep.\\n\\n    If :ref:`CONFIG_PM_POWER_DOWN_PERIPHERAL_IN_LIGHT_SLEEP` is enabled, when the driver initializes the peripheral, the driver will register the working register context of the peripheral to the sleep retention link. Before entering sleep, the ``REG_DMA`` peripheral reads the configuration in the sleep retention link, and back up the register context to memory according to the configuration. ``REG_DMA`` also restores context from memory to peripheral registers on wakeup.\\n\\n    Currently ESP-IDF supports Light-sleep context retention for the following peripherals:\\n    - INT_MTX\\n    - TEE/APM\\n    - IO_MUX / GPIO\\n    - UART0\\n    - TIMG0\\n    - SPI0/1\\n    - SYSTIMER\\n\\n    The following peripherals are not yet supported:\\n    - ETM\\n    - TIMG1\\n    - ASSIST_DEBUG\\n    - Trace\\n    - Crypto: AES/ECC/HMAC/RSA/SHA/DS/XTA_AES/ECDSA\\n    - SPI2\\n    - I2S\\n    - PCNT\\n    - USB-Serial-JTAG\\n    - TWAI\\n    - LEDC\\n    - MCPWM\\n    - RMT\\n    - SARADC\\n    - SDIO\\n    - PARL_IO\\n    - UART1\\n\\n    For peripherals that do not support Light-sleep context retention, if the Power management is enabled, the ``ESP_PM_NO_LIGHT_SLEEP`` lock should be held when the peripheral is working to avoid losing the working context of the peripheral when entering sleep.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        When the peripheral power domain is powered down during sleep, both the IO_MUX and GPIO modules are inactive, meaning the chip pins\\' state is not maintained by these modules. To preserve the state of an IO during sleep, it\\'s essential to call :cpp:func:`gpio_hold_dis` and :cpp:func:`gpio_hold_en` before and after configuring the GPIO state. This action ensures that the IO configuration is latched and prevents the IO from becoming floating while in sleep mode.\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_pm.inc\\n',\n",
       " 'Programming ULP FSM Coprocessor Using C Macros (Legacy)\\n=======================================================\\n\\nIn addition to the existing binutils port for the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} ULP coprocessor, it is possible to generate programs for the ULP FSM coprocessor by embedding assembly-like macros into an {IDF_TARGET_NAME} application. Here is an example how this can be done::\\n\\n    const ulp_insn_t program[] = {\\n        I_MOVI(R3, 16),         // R3 <- 16\\n        I_LD(R0, R3, 0),        // R0 <- RTC_SLOW_MEM[R3 + 0]\\n        I_LD(R1, R3, 1),        // R1 <- RTC_SLOW_MEM[R3 + 1]\\n        I_ADDR(R2, R0, R1),     // R2 <- R0 + R1\\n        I_ST(R2, R3, 2),        // R2 -> RTC_SLOW_MEM[R2 + 2]\\n        I_HALT()\\n    };\\n    size_t load_addr = 0;\\n    size_t size = sizeof(program)/sizeof(ulp_insn_t);\\n    ulp_process_macros_and_load(load_addr, program, &size);\\n    ulp_run(load_addr);\\n\\nThe ``program`` array is an array of ``ulp_insn_t``, i.e., ULP coprocessor instructions. Each ``I_XXX`` preprocessor define translates into a single 32-bit instruction. Arguments of these preprocessor defines can be register numbers (``R0 — R3``) and literal constants. See the API reference section at the end of this guide for descriptions of instructions and arguments they take.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Because some of the instruction macros expand to inline function calls, defining such array in global scope will cause the compiler to produce an \"initializer element is not constant\" error. To fix this error, move the definition of instructions array into local scope.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Load, store and move instructions use **addresses expressed in 32-bit words**. Address 0 corresponds to the first word of ``RTC_SLOW_MEM``.\\n    This is different to how address arguments are handled in assembly code of the same instructions. See the section :ref:`ulp-fsm-addressing` for more details for reference.\\n\\nTo generate branch instructions, special ``M_`` preprocessor defines are used. ``M_LABEL`` define can be used to define a branch target. Label identifier is a 16-bit integer. ``M_Bxxx`` defines can be used to generate branch instructions with target set to a particular label.\\n\\nImplementation note: these ``M_`` preprocessor defines will be translated into two ulp_insn_t values: one is a token value which contains label number, and the other is the actual instruction. ``ulp_process_macros_and_load`` function resolves the label number to the address, modifies the branch instruction to use the correct address, and removes the extra ``ulp_insn_t`` token which contains the label numer.\\n\\nHere is an example of using labels and branches::\\n\\n    const ulp_insn_t program[] = {\\n        I_MOVI(R0, 34),         // R0 <- 34\\n        M_LABEL(1),             // label_1\\n        I_MOVI(R1, 32),         // R1 <- 32\\n        I_LD(R1, R1, 0),        // R1 <- RTC_SLOW_MEM[R1]\\n        I_MOVI(R2, 33),         // R2 <- 33\\n        I_LD(R2, R2, 0),        // R2 <- RTC_SLOW_MEM[R2]\\n        I_SUBR(R3, R1, R2),     // R3 <- R1 - R2\\n        I_ST(R3, R0, 0),        // R3 -> RTC_SLOW_MEM[R0 + 0]\\n        I_ADDI(R0, R0, 1),      // R0++\\n        M_BL(1, 64),            // if (R0 < 64) goto label_1\\n        I_HALT(),\\n    };\\n    RTC_SLOW_MEM[32] = 42;\\n    RTC_SLOW_MEM[33] = 18;\\n    size_t load_addr = 0;\\n    size_t size = sizeof(program)/sizeof(ulp_insn_t);\\n    ulp_process_macros_and_load(load_addr, program, &size);\\n    ulp_run(load_addr);\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/ulp.inc\\n',\n",

       " 'Over The Air Updates (OTA)\\n==========================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOTA Process Overview\\n--------------------\\n\\nThe OTA update mechanism allows a device to update itself based on data received while the normal firmware is running (for example, over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or Ethernet).\\n\\nOTA requires configuring the :doc:`../../api-guides/partition-tables` of the device with at least two OTA app slot partitions (i.e., ``ota_0`` and ``ota_1``) and an OTA Data Partition.\\n\\nThe OTA operation functions write a new app firmware image to whichever OTA app slot that is currently not selected for booting. Once the image is verified, the OTA Data partition is updated to specify that this image should be used for the next boot.\\n\\n.. _ota_data_partition:\\n\\nOTA Data Partition\\n------------------\\n\\nAn OTA data partition (type ``data``, subtype ``ota``) must be included in the :doc:`../../api-guides/partition-tables` of any project which uses the OTA functions.\\n\\nFor factory boot settings, the OTA data partition should contain no data (all bytes erased to 0xFF). In this case, the ESP-IDF software bootloader will boot the factory app if it is present in the partition table. If no factory app is included in the partition table, the first available OTA slot (usually ``ota_0``) is booted.\\n\\nAfter the first OTA update, the OTA data partition is updated to specify which OTA app slot partition should be booted next.\\n\\nThe OTA data partition is two flash sectors (0x2000 bytes) in size, to prevent problems if there is a power failure while it is being written. Sectors are independently erased and written with matching data, and if they disagree a counter field is used to determine which sector was written more recently.\\n\\n.. _app_rollback:\\n\\nApp Rollback\\n------------\\n\\nThe main purpose of the application rollback is to keep the device working after the update. This feature allows you to roll back to the previous working application in case a new application has critical errors. When the rollback process is enabled and an OTA update provides a new version of the app, one of three things can happen:\\n\\n* The application works fine, :cpp:func:`esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback` marks the running application with the state ``ESP_OTA_IMG_VALID``. There are no restrictions on booting this application.\\n* The application has critical errors and further work is not possible, a rollback to the previous application is required, :cpp:func:`esp_ota_mark_app_invalid_rollback_and_reboot` marks the running application with the state ``ESP_OTA_IMG_INVALID`` and reset. This application will not be selected by the bootloader for boot and will boot the previously working application.\\n* If the :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE` option is set, and a reset occurs without calling either function then the application is rolled back.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  The state is not written to the binary image of the application but rather to the ``otadata`` partition. The partition contains a ``ota_seq`` counter, which is a pointer to the slot (``ota_0``, ``ota_1``, ...) from which the application will be selected for boot.\\n\\nApp OTA State\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nStates control the process of selecting a boot app:\\n\\n============================= ======================================================================\\n            States            Restriction of selecting a boot app in bootloader\\n============================= ======================================================================\\n ESP_OTA_IMG_VALID            None restriction. Will be selected.\\n ESP_OTA_IMG_UNDEFINED        None restriction. Will be selected.\\n ESP_OTA_IMG_INVALID          Will not be selected.\\n ESP_OTA_IMG_ABORTED          Will not be selected.\\n ESP_OTA_IMG_NEW              If :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE` option is set it will\\n                              be selected only once. In bootloader the state immediately changes to\\n                              ``ESP_OTA_IMG_PENDING_VERIFY``.\\n ESP_OTA_IMG_PENDING_VERIFY   If :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE` option is set it will\\n                              not be selected, and the state will change to ``ESP_OTA_IMG_ABORTED``.\\n============================= ======================================================================\\n\\nIf :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE` option is not enabled (by default), then the use of the following functions :cpp:func:`esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback` and :cpp:func:`esp_ota_mark_app_invalid_rollback_and_reboot` are optional, and ``ESP_OTA_IMG_NEW`` and ``ESP_OTA_IMG_PENDING_VERIFY`` states are not used.\\n\\nAn option in Kconfig :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE` allows you to track the first boot of a new application. In this case, the application must confirm its operability by calling :cpp:func:`esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback` function, otherwise the application will be rolled back upon reboot. It allows you to control the operability of the application during the boot phase. Thus, a new application has only one attempt to boot successfully.\\n\\n.. _ota_rollback:\\n\\nRollback Process\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe description of the rollback process when :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE` option is enabled:\\n\\n* The new application is successfully downloaded and :cpp:func:`esp_ota_set_boot_partition` function makes this partition bootable and sets the state ``ESP_OTA_IMG_NEW``. This state means that the application is new and should be monitored for its first boot.\\n* Reboot :cpp:func:`esp_restart`.\\n* The bootloader checks for the ``ESP_OTA_IMG_PENDING_VERIFY`` state if it is set, then it will be written to ``ESP_OTA_IMG_ABORTED``.\\n* The bootloader selects a new application to boot so that the state is not set as ``ESP_OTA_IMG_INVALID`` or ``ESP_OTA_IMG_ABORTED``.\\n* The bootloader checks the selected application for ``ESP_OTA_IMG_NEW`` state if it is set, then it will be written to ``ESP_OTA_IMG_PENDING_VERIFY``. This state means that the application requires confirmation of its operability, if this does not happen and a reboot occurs, this state will be overwritten to ``ESP_OTA_IMG_ABORTED`` (see above) and this application will no longer be able to start, i.e., there will be a rollback to the previous working application.\\n* A new application has started and should make a self-test.\\n* If the self-test has completed successfully, then you must call the function :cpp:func:`esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback` because the application is awaiting confirmation of operability (``ESP_OTA_IMG_PENDING_VERIFY`` state).\\n* If the self-test fails, then call :cpp:func:`esp_ota_mark_app_invalid_rollback_and_reboot` function to roll back to the previous working application, while the invalid application is set ``ESP_OTA_IMG_INVALID`` state.\\n* If the application has not been confirmed, the state remains ``ESP_OTA_IMG_PENDING_VERIFY``, and the next boot it will be changed to ``ESP_OTA_IMG_ABORTED``, which prevents re-boot of this application. There will be a rollback to the previous working application.\\n\\nUnexpected Reset\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf a power loss or an unexpected crash occurs at the time of the first boot of a new application, it will roll back the application.\\n\\nRecommendation: Perform the self-test procedure as quickly as possible, to prevent rollback due to power loss.\\n\\nOnly ``OTA`` partitions can be rolled back. Factory partition is not rolled back.\\n\\nBooting Invalid/aborted Apps\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBooting an application which was previously set to ``ESP_OTA_IMG_INVALID`` or ``ESP_OTA_IMG_ABORTED`` is possible:\\n\\n* Get the last invalid application partition :cpp:func:`esp_ota_get_last_invalid_partition`.\\n* Pass the received partition to :cpp:func:`esp_ota_set_boot_partition`, this will update the ``otadata``.\\n* Restart :cpp:func:`esp_restart`. The bootloader will boot the specified application.\\n\\nTo determine if self-tests should be run during startup of an application, call the :cpp:func:`esp_ota_get_state_partition` function. If result is ``ESP_OTA_IMG_PENDING_VERIFY`` then self-testing and subsequent confirmation of operability is required.\\n\\nWhere the States Are Set\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nA brief description of where the states are set:\\n\\n* ``ESP_OTA_IMG_VALID`` state is set by :cpp:func:`esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback` function.\\n* ``ESP_OTA_IMG_UNDEFINED`` state is set by :cpp:func:`esp_ota_set_boot_partition` function if :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE` option is not enabled.\\n* ``ESP_OTA_IMG_NEW`` state is set by :cpp:func:`esp_ota_set_boot_partition` function if :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE` option is enabled.\\n* ``ESP_OTA_IMG_INVALID`` state is set by  :cpp:func:`esp_ota_mark_app_invalid_rollback_and_reboot` function.\\n* ``ESP_OTA_IMG_ABORTED`` state is set if there was no confirmation of the application operability and occurs reboots (if :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE` option is enabled).\\n* ``ESP_OTA_IMG_PENDING_VERIFY`` state is set in a bootloader if :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE` option is enabled and selected app has ``ESP_OTA_IMG_NEW`` state.\\n\\n.. _anti-rollback:\\n\\nAnti-rollback\\n-------------\\n\\nAnti-rollback prevents rollback to application with security version lower than one programmed in eFuse of chip.\\n\\nThis function works if set :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ANTI_ROLLBACK` option. In the bootloader, when selecting a bootable application, an additional security version check is added which is on the chip and in the application image. The version in the bootable firmware must be greater than or equal to the version in the chip.\\n\\n:ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ANTI_ROLLBACK` and :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_ROLLBACK_ENABLE` options are used together. In this case, rollback is possible only on the security version which is equal or higher than the version in the chip.\\n\\n\\nA Typical Anti-rollback Scheme Is\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- New firmware released with the elimination of vulnerabilities with the previous version of security.\\n- After the developer makes sure that this firmware is working. He can increase the security version and release a new firmware.\\n- Download new application.\\n- To make it bootable, run the function :cpp:func:`esp_ota_set_boot_partition`. If the security version of the new application is smaller than the version in the chip, the new application will be erased. Update to new firmware is not possible.\\n- Reboot.\\n- In the bootloader, an application with a security version greater than or equal to the version in the chip will be selected. If otadata is in the initial state, and one firmware was loaded via a serial channel, whose secure version is higher than the chip, then the secure version of efuse will be immediately updated in the bootloader.\\n- New application booted. Then the application should perform diagnostics of the operation and if it is completed successfully, you should call :cpp:func:`esp_ota_mark_app_valid_cancel_rollback` function to mark the running application with the ``ESP_OTA_IMG_VALID`` state and update the secure version on chip.

However, because the address space for external memory is limited to 4 MiB, only SPI RAM chips that are <= 4 MiB in size can be used fully transparently.\\n\\nIt is still possible for ESP32 to use SPI RAM chips >= 4 MiB in size. However, the memory on these chips needs to be accessed using a bank switching scheme. ESP-IDF provides the **Himem API** to control this bank switching. More specifically, the Himem API allows particular 32 K banks within 4 MiB address switch mappings at run time, thus allowing access to more than 4 MiB of external memory.\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\nIn order to use the Himem API, you have to enable it in the menuconfig using :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_BANKSWITCH_ENABLE`, as well as set the amount of banks reserved for this in :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_BANKSWITCH_RESERVE`. This decreases the amount of external memory allocated by functions like ``malloc()``, but it allows you to use the Himem API to map any of the remaining memory into the reserved banks.\\n\\nThe Himem API is more-or-less an abstraction of the bank switching scheme: it allows you to claim one or more banks of address space (called \\'regions\\' in the API) as well as one or more of banks of memory to map into the ranges.\\n\\nExample\\n-------\\n\\nAn example doing a simple memory test of the high memory range is available in ESP-IDF: :example:`system/himem`\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/himem.inc\\n',\n",

       " 'Chip Revision\\n=============\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} may have different revisions. These revisions mainly fix some issues, and sometimes also bring new features to the chip. :ref:`versioning scheme` describes the versioning of these chip revisions, and the APIs to read the versions at runtime.\\n\\nThere are some considerations of compatibility among application, ESP-IDF version, and chip revisions:\\n\\n- Applications may depend on some fixes/features provided by a chip revision.\\n- When using updated version of hardware, the hardware may be incompatible with earlier versions of ESP-IDF.\\n\\n:ref:`revision_limitation` describes how the application can specify its chip revision requirements, and the way ESP-IDF checks the compatibility. After that, there is troubleshooting information for this mechanism.\\n\\n.. _versioning scheme:\\n\\nVersioning Scheme\\n-----------------\\n\\nA chip\\'s revision number is typically expressed as ``vX.Y``, where:\\n\\n- ``X`` means a **Major** wafer version. If it is changed, it means that the current software version is not compatible with this released chip and the software must be updated to use this chip.\\n\\n- ``Y`` means a **Minor** wafer version. If it is changed that means the current software version is compatible with the released chip, and there is no need to update the software.\\n\\nIf a newly released chip does not contain breaking changes, the chip can run the same software as the previous chip. As such, the new chip\\'s revision number will only increment the minor version while keeping the major version the same (e.g., ``v1.1`` to ``v1.2``).\\n\\nConversely, if a newly released chip contains breaking changes, the chip **cannot** run the same software as the previous chip. As such, the new chip\\'s revision number will increment the major version and set the minor version to 0 (e.g., ``v1.1`` to ``v2.0``).\\n\\nThis versioning scheme was selected to indicate the derivation relationship of chip revisions, and clearly distinguish changes in chips between breaking changes and non-breaking changes.\\n\\nESP-IDF is designed to execute seamlessly on future chip minor revisions with the same logic as the chip\\'s nearest previous minor revision. Thus，users can directly port their compiled binaries to newer MINOR chip revisions without upgrading their ESP-IDF version and re-compile the whole project.\\n\\nWhen a binary is executed on a chip revision of unexpected MAJOR revision, the software is also able to report issues according to the MAJOR revision. The major and minor versioning scheme also allows hardware changes to be branchable.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The current chip revision scheme using major and minor versions was introduced from ESP-IDF v5.0 onwards. Thus bootloaders built using earlier versions of ESP-IDF will still use the legacy chip revision scheme of wafer versions.\\n\\nEFuse Bits for Chip Revisions\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nChips have several eFuse version fields:\\n\\n- Major wafer version (``WAFER_VERSION_MAJOR`` eFuse)\\n- Minor wafer version (``WAFER_VERSION_MINOR`` eFuse)\\n- Ignore maximum revision (``DISABLE_WAFER_VERSION_MAJOR`` eFuse). See :ref:`revision_limitation` on how this is used.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The previous versioning logic was based on a single eFuse version field (``WAFER_VERSION``). This approach makes it impossible to mark chips as breaking or non-breaking changes, and the versioning logic becomes linear.\\n\\n\\nChip Revision APIs\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThese APIs helps to get chip revision from eFuses:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`efuse_hal_chip_revision`. It returns revision in the ``major * 100 + minor`` format.\\n- :cpp:func:`efuse_hal_get_major_chip_version`. It returns Major revision.\\n- :cpp:func:`efuse_hal_get_minor_chip_version`. It returns Minor revision.\\n\\nThe following Kconfig definitions (in ``major * 100 + minor`` format) that can help add the chip revision dependency to the code:\\n\\n- ``CONFIG_{IDF_TARGET_CFG_PREFIX}_REV_MIN_FULL``\\n- ``CONFIG_ESP_REV_MIN_FULL``\\n- ``CONFIG_{IDF_TARGET_CFG_PREFIX}_REV_MAX_FULL``\\n- ``CONFIG_ESP_REV_MAX_FULL``\\n\\n\\n.. _revision_limitation:\\n\\nCompatibility Checks of ESP-IDF\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nWhen building an application that needs to support multiple revisions of a particular chip, the minimum and maximum chip revision numbers supported by the build are specified via Kconfig.\\n\\nThe minimum chip revision can be configured via the :ref:`CONFIG_{IDF_TARGET_CFG_PREFIX}_REV_MIN` option. Specifying the minimum chip revision will limit the software to only run on a chip revisions that are high enough to support some features or bugfixes.\\n\\nThe maximum chip revision cannot be configured and is automatically determined by the current ESP-IDF version being used. ESP-IDF will refuse to boot any chip revision exceeding the maximum chip revision. Given that it is impossible for a particular ESP-IDF version to foresee all future chip revisions, the maximum chip revision is usually set to ``maximum supported MAJOR version + 99``. The \"Ignore Maximum Revision\" eFuse can be set to bypass the maximum revision limitation. However, the software is not guaranteed to work if the maximum revision is ignored.\\n\\nBelow is the information about troubleshooting when the chip revision fails the compatibility check. Then there are technical details of the checking and software behavior on earlier version of ESP-IDF.\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n1. If the 2nd stage bootloader is run on a chip revision smaller than minimum revision specified in the image (i.e., the application), a reboot occurs. The following message will be printed:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    Image requires chip rev >= v3.0, but chip is v1.0\\n\\nTo resolve this issue,\\n\\n- Use a chip with the required minimum revision or higher.\\n- Lower the :ref:`CONFIG_{IDF_TARGET_CFG_PREFIX}_REV_MIN` value and rebuild the image so that it is compatible with the chip revision being used.\\n\\n2. If application does not match minimum and maximum chip revisions, a reboot occurs. The following message will be printed:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    Image requires chip rev <= v2.99, but chip is v3.0\\n\\nTo resolve this issue, update ESP-IDF to a newer version that supports the chip\\'s revision (``CONFIG_{IDF_TARGET_CFG_PREFIX}_REV_MAX_FULL``). Alternatively, set the ``Ignore maximal revision`` bit in eFuse or use a chip revision that is compatible with the current version of ESP-IDF.\\n\\nRepresenting Revision Requirements of a Binary Image\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe 2nd stage bootloader and the application binary images contain the :cpp:type:`esp_image_header_t` header, which stores information specifying the chip revisions that the image is permitted to run on. This header has 3 fields related to revisions:\\n\\n- ``min_chip_rev`` - Minimum chip MAJOR revision required by image (but for ESP32-C3 it is MINOR revision). Its value is determined by :ref:`CONFIG_{IDF_TARGET_CFG_PREFIX}_REV_MIN`.\\n- ``min_chip_rev_full`` - Minimum chip MINOR revision required by image in format: ``major * 100 + minor``. Its value is determined by :ref:`CONFIG_{IDF_TARGET_CFG_PREFIX}_REV_MIN`.\\n- ``max_chip_rev_full`` - Maximum chip revision required by image in format: ``major * 100 + minor``. Its value is determined by ``CONFIG_{IDF_TARGET_CFG_PREFIX}_REV_MAX_FULL``. It can not be changed by user. Only Espressif can change it when a new version will be supported in ESP-IDF.\\n\\nMaximum And Minimum Revision Restrictions\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe order for checking the minimum and maximum revisions during application boot up is as follows:\\n\\n1. The 1st stage bootloader (ROM bootloader) does not check minimum and maximum revision fields from :cpp:type:`esp_image_header_t` before running the 2nd stage bootloader.\\n\\n2. The initialization phase of the  2nd stage bootloader checks that the 2nd stage bootloader itself can be launched on the chip of this revision. It extracts the minimum revision from the header of the bootloader image and checks against the chip revision from eFuses. If the chip revision is less than the minimum revision, the bootloader refuses to boot up and aborts. The maximum revision is not checked at this phase.\\n\\n3. Then the 2nd stage bootloader checks the revision requirements of the application. It extracts the minimum and maximum revisions from the header of the application image and checks against the chip revision from eFuses. If the chip revision is less than the minimum revision or higher than the maximum revision, the bootloader refuses to boot up and aborts. However, if the Ignore maximum revision bit is set, the maximum revision constraint can be ignored. The ignore bit is set by the customer themselves when there is confirmation that the software is able to work with this chip revision.\\n\\n4. Furthermore, at the OTA update stage, the running application checks if the new software matches the chip revision. It extracts the minimum and maximum revisions from the header of the new application image and checks against the chip revision from eFuses. It checks for revision matching in the same way that the bootloader does, so that the chip revision is between the min and max revisions (logic of ignoring max revision also applies).\\n\\nBackward Compatibility with Bootloaders Built by Older ESP-IDF Versions\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32c3 or esp32s2 or esp32s3\\n\\n    The old bootloaders (ESP-IDF < v5.0) do not know about Major and Minor wafer version eFuses. They use one single eFuse for this - wafer version.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    The old bootloaders did not read the minor wafer version eFuse, and the major version can be only lower than or equal to v3. This means that the old bootloader can detect correctly only chip version in range ``v0.0`` to ``v3.0``, where the minor version is always set to ``0``.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c2\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip support was added in ESP-IDF v5.0. The bootloader is able to detect any chip versions in range ``v0.0`` to ``v3.15``.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c3\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip support was added in ESP-IDF v4.3. The old bootloaders cannot read all bits of the wafer version eFuse, it can read only the first 3 least significant bits. This means that the old bootloader cannot detect chip version correctly. Chips ``v0.0`` to ``v0.8`` are detected correctly, but other chip versions will be recognized as a version from this range.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s2 or esp32s3\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip support was added in ESP-IDF v4.2. {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chips have ``rev_min`` in :cpp:type:`esp_image_header_t` header set to ``0`` because ``Minimum Supported ESP32-S2 Revision`` Kconfig option was not introduced, which means that the old bootloader does not check the chip revision. Any app can be loaded by such bootloader in range ``v0.0`` to ``v3.15``.\\n\\nPlease check the chip version using ``esptool chip_id`` command.\\n\\nReferences\\n----------\\n\\n- `Compatibility Advisory for Chip Revision Numbering Scheme <https://www.espressif.com.cn/sites/default/files/advisory_downloads/AR2022-005%20Compatibility%20Advisory%20for%20Chip%20Revision%20Numbering%20%20Scheme.pdf>`_\\n- `Compatibility Between ESP-IDF Releases and Revisions of Espressif SoCs <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/master/COMPATIBILITY.md>`_\\n- `SoC Errata <https://www.espressif.com.cn/en/support/documents/technical-documents?keys=errata>`_\\n- :doc:`/versions`\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/efuse_hal.inc\\n',\n",
       " '{IDF_TARGET_NAME} ULP Coprocessor Instruction Set\\n=================================================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThis document provides details about the instructions used by {IDF_TARGET_NAME} ULP FSM coprocessor assembler.\\n\\nULP FSM coprocessor has 4 16-bit general purpose registers, labeled R0, R1, R2, R3. It also has an 8-bit counter register (``stage_cnt``) which can be used to implement loops. Stage count register is accessed using special instructions.\\n\\nULP coprocessor can access 8 K bytes of RTC_SLOW_MEM memory region. Memory is addressed in 32-bit word units. It can also access peripheral registers in ``RTC_CNTL``, ``RTC_IO``, and ``SENS`` peripherals.\\n\\nAll instructions are 32-bit. Jump instructions, ALU instructions, peripheral register and memory access instructions are executed in 1 cycle. Instructions which work with peripherals (TSENS, ADC, I2C) take variable number of cycles, depending on peripheral operation.\\n\\nThe instruction syntax is case insensitive. Upper and lower case letters can be used and intermixed arbitrarily. This is true both for register names and instruction names.\\n\\n.. _ulp-fsm-addressing:\\n\\nNote About Addressing\\n---------------------\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} ULP FSM coprocessor\\'s ``JUMP``, ``ST``, ``LD`` family of instructions expect the address argument to be expressed in the following way depending on the type of address argument used:\\n\\n- When the address argument is presented as a label then the instruction expects the address to be expressed as 32-bit words.\\n\\n  Consider the following example program::\\n\\n    entry:\\n            NOP\\n            NOP\\n            NOP\\n            NOP\\n    loop:\\n            MOVE R1, loop\\n            JUMP R1\\n\\n  When this program is assembled and linked, address of label ``loop`` will be equal to 16 (expressed in bytes). However ``JUMP`` instruction expects the address stored in register ``R1`` to be expressed in 32-bit words. To account for this common use case, the assembler will convert the address of label ``loop`` from bytes to words when generating the ``MOVE`` instruction. Hence, the code generated code will be equivalent to::\\n\\n    0000    NOP\\n    0004    NOP\\n    0008    NOP\\n    000c    NOP\\n    0010    MOVE R1, 4\\n    0014    JUMP R1\\n\\n- The other case is when the argument of ``MOVE`` instruction is not a label but a constant. In this case, assembler will **use the value as is**, without any conversion::\\n\\n            .set        val, 0x10\\n            MOVE        R1, val\\n\\n  In this case, value loaded into ``R1`` will be ``0x10``.\\n\\n  However, when an immediate value is used as an offset in ``LD`` and ``ST`` instructions, the assembler considers the address argument in bytes and converts it to 32-bit words before executing the instruction::\\n\\n            ST R1, R2, 4        // offset = 4 bytes; Mem[R2 + 4 / 4] = R1\\n\\n  In this case, the value in R1 is stored at the memory location pointed by [R2 + offset / 4].\\n\\n  Consider the following code::\\n\\n            .global array\\n    array:  .long 0\\n            .long 0\\n            .long 0\\n            .long 0\\n\\n            MOVE R1, array\\n            MOVE R2, 0x1234\\n            ST R2, R1, 0      // write value of R2 into the first array element,\\n                              // i.e., array[0]\\n\\n            ST R2, R1, 4      // write value of R2 into the second array element,\\n                              // (4 byte offset), i.e., array[1]\\n\\n            ADD R1, R1, 2     // this increments address by 2 words (8 bytes)\\n            ST R2, R1, 0      // write value of R2 into the third array element,\\n                              // i.e., array[2]\\n\\nNote About Instruction Execution Time\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nULP coprocessor is clocked from ``RTC_FAST_CLK``, which is normally derived from the internal 8 MHz oscillator. Applications which need to know exact ULP clock frequency can calibrate it against the main XTAL clock::\\n\\n    #include \"soc/rtc.h\"\\n\\n    // calibrate 8M/256 clock against XTAL, get 8M/256 clock period\\n    uint32_t rtc_8md256_period = rtc_clk_cal(RTC_CAL_8MD256, 100);\\n    uint32_t rtc_fast_freq_hz = 1000000ULL * (1 << RTC_CLK_CAL_FRACT) * 256 / rtc_8md256_period;\\n\\nULP coprocessor needs certain number of clock cycles to fetch each instruction, plus certain number of cycles to execute it, depending on the instruction. See description of each instruction below for details on the execution time.\\n\\nInstruction fetch time is:\\n\\n- 2 clock cycles — for instructions following ALU and branch instructions\\n- 4 clock cycles — in other cases\\n\\nNote that when accessing RTC memories and RTC registers, ULP coprocessor has lower priority than the main CPUs. This means that ULP coprocessor execution may be suspended while the main CPUs access same memory region as the ULP.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s2 or esp32s3\\n\\n    Difference Between ESP32 ULP and {IDF_TARGET_NAME} ULP Instruction Sets\\n    -------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Compared to the ESP32 ULP FSM coprocessor, the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} ULP FSM coprocessor has an extended instruction set. The {IDF_TARGET_NAME} ULP FSM is not binary compatible with ESP32 ULP FSM, but a ESP32 ULP FSM assembled program is expected to work on the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} ULP FSM after rebuilding.\\n\\n    The list of the new instructions that was added to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} ULP FSM is: ``LDL``, ``LDH``, ``STL``, ``STH``, ``ST32``, ``STO``, ``STI``, ``STI32``.\\n\\n\\nThe detailed description of all instructions is presented below:\\n\\n**NOP** - No Operation\\n----------------------\\n\\n**Syntax**\\n\\n  **NOP**\\n\\n**Operands**\\n\\n  None\\n\\n**Cycles**\\n\\n  2 cycle to execute, 4 cycles to fetch next instruction\\n\\n**Description**\\n\\n  No operation is performed.

This library operates eFuse bits by a structure name which is assigned in eFuse table. This sections introduces some concepts used by eFuse Manager.\\n\\n\\nHardware Description\\n--------------------\\n\\nThe {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has a number of eFuses which can store system and user parameters. Each eFuse is a one-bit field which can be programmed to 1 after which it cannot be reverted back to 0.\\nSome of system parameters are using these eFuse bits directly by hardware modules and have special place (for example EFUSE_BLK0).\\n\\nFor more details, see **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **eFuse Controller (eFuse)** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#efuse>`__]. Some eFuse bits are available for user applications.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has 4 eFuse blocks each of the size of 256 bits (not all bits are available):\\n\\n    * EFUSE_BLK0 is used entirely for system purposes;\\n    * EFUSE_BLK1 is used for flash encrypt key. If not using that Flash Encryption feature, they can be used for another purpose;\\n    * EFUSE_BLK2 is used for security boot key. If not using that Secure Boot feature, they can be used for another purpose;\\n    * EFUSE_BLK3 can be partially reserved for the custom MAC address, or used entirely for user application. Note that some bits are already used in ESP-IDF.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32 and not esp32c2\\n\\n  .. list::\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has 11 eFuse blocks each of the size of 256 bits (not all bits are available):\\n\\n    * EFUSE_BLK0 is used entirely for system purposes;\\n    * EFUSE_BLK1 is used entirely for system purposes;\\n    * EFUSE_BLK2 is used entirely for system purposes;\\n    * EFUSE_BLK3 (also named EFUSE_BLK_USER_DATA) can be used for user purposes;\\n    * EFUSE_BLK4 (also named EFUSE_BLK_KEY0) can be used as key (for secure_boot or flash_encryption) or for user purposes;\\n    * EFUSE_BLK5 (also named EFUSE_BLK_KEY1) can be used as key (for secure_boot or flash_encryption) or for user purposes;\\n    * EFUSE_BLK6 (also named EFUSE_BLK_KEY2) can be used as key (for secure_boot or flash_encryption) or for user purposes;\\n    * EFUSE_BLK7 (also named EFUSE_BLK_KEY3) can be used as key (for secure_boot or flash_encryption) or for user purposes;\\n    * EFUSE_BLK8 (also named EFUSE_BLK_KEY4) can be used as key (for secure_boot or flash_encryption) or for user purposes;\\n    :SOC_EFUSE_BLOCK9_KEY_PURPOSE_QUIRK and SOC_ECDSA_SUPPORTED: * EFUSE_BLK9 (also named EFUSE_BLK_KEY5) can be used for any purpose except for flash encryption or ECDSA (due to a HW bug);\\n    :SOC_EFUSE_BLOCK9_KEY_PURPOSE_QUIRK and not SOC_ECDSA_SUPPORTED: * EFUSE_BLK9 (also named EFUSE_BLK_KEY5) can be used for any purpose except for flash encryption (due to a HW bug);\\n    :not SOC_EFUSE_BLOCK9_KEY_PURPOSE_QUIRK: * EFUSE_BLK9 (also named EFUSE_BLK_KEY5) can be used as key (for secure_boot or flash_encryption) or for user purposes;\\n    * EFUSE_BLK10 (also named EFUSE_BLK_SYS_DATA_PART2) is reseved for system purposes.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c2\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has 4 eFuse blocks each of the size of 256 bits (not all bits are available):\\n\\n    * EFUSE_BLK0 is used entirely for system purposes;\\n    * EFUSE_BLK1 is used entirely for system purposes;\\n    * EFUSE_BLK2 is used entirely for system purposes;\\n    * EFUSE_BLK3 (also named EFUSE_BLK_KEY0) can be used as key (for secure_boot or flash_encryption) or for user purposes;\\n\\nEach block is divided into 8 32-bits registers.\\n\\n\\neFuse Manager Component\\n-----------------------\\n\\nThe component has API functions for reading and writing fields. Access to the fields is carried out through the structures that describe the location of the eFuse bits in the blocks. The component provides the ability to form fields of any length and from any number of individual bits. The description of the fields is made in a CSV file in a table form. To generate from a tabular form (CSV file) in the C-source uses the tool ``efuse_table_gen.py``. The tool checks the CSV file for uniqueness of field names and bit intersection, in case of using a `custom` file from the user\\'s project directory, the utility checks with the `common` CSV file.\\n\\nCSV files:\\n\\n* common (`esp_efuse_table.csv`) - contains eFuse fields which are used inside the ESP-IDF. C-source generation should be done manually when changing this file (run command ``idf.py efuse-common-table``). Note that changes in this file can lead to incorrect operation.\\n* custom - (optional and can be enabled by :ref:`CONFIG_EFUSE_CUSTOM_TABLE`) contains eFuse fields that are used by the user in their application. C-source generation should be done manually when changing this file and running ``idf.py efuse-custom-table``.\\n\\n\\nDescription CSV File\\n--------------------\\n\\nThe CSV file contains a description of the eFuse fields. In the simple case, one field has one line of description.\\nTable header:\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_MAX_EFUSE_BLK:default = \"EFUSE_BLK10\", esp32 = \"EFUSE_BLK3\", esp32c2 = \"EFUSE_BLK3\"}\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    # field_name,  efuse_block(EFUSE_BLK0..{IDF_TARGET_MAX_EFUSE_BLK}), bit_start(0..255),    bit_count(1..256),        comment\\n\\nIndividual params in CSV file the following meanings:\\n\\nfield_name\\n\\n    Name of field. The prefix `ESP_EFUSE_` is added to the name, and this field name is available in the code. This name is used to access the fields. The name must be unique for all fields. If the line has an empty name, then this line is combined with the previous field. This allows you to set an arbitrary order of bits in the field, and expand the field as well (see ``MAC_FACTORY`` field in the common table). The field_name supports structured format using `.` to show that the field belongs to another field (see ``WR_DIS`` and ``RD_DIS`` in the common table).\\n\\nefuse_block\\n\\n    Block number. It determines where the eFuse bits are placed for this field. Available EFUSE_BLK0..{IDF_TARGET_MAX_EFUSE_BLK}.\\n\\nbit_start\\n\\n    Start bit number (0..255). The bit_start field can be omitted. In this case, it is set to bit_start + bit_count from the previous record, if it has the same efuse_block. Otherwise (if efuse_block is different, or this is the first entry), an error will be generated.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    bit_count\\n\\n        The number of bits to use in this field (1..-). This parameter cannot be omitted. This field also may be ``MAX_BLK_LEN`` in this case, the field length has the maximum block length, taking into account the coding scheme (applicable for ``ESP_EFUSE_SECURE_BOOT_KEY`` and ``ESP_EFUSE_ENCRYPT_FLASH_KEY`` fields). The value ``MAX_BLK_LEN`` depends on :ref:`CONFIG_EFUSE_CODE_SCHEME_SELECTOR`, which will be replaced with \"None\" - 256, \"3/4\" - 192, \"REPEAT\" - 128.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n    bit_count\\n\\n        The number of bits to use in this field (1..-). This parameter cannot be omitted. This field also may be ``MAX_BLK_LEN`` in this case, the field length has the maximum block length.\\n\\ncomment\\n\\n    This param is using for comment field, it also move to C-header file. The comment field can be omitted.\\n\\nIf a non-sequential bit order is required to describe a field, then the field description in the following lines should be continued without specifying a name, indicating that it belongs to one field. For example two fields ``MAC_FACTORY`` and ``MAC_FACTORY_CRC``:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    # Factory MAC address #\\n    #######################\\n    MAC_FACTORY,            EFUSE_BLK0,    72,    8,    Factory MAC addr [0]\\n    ,                       EFUSE_BLK0,    64,    8,    Factory MAC addr [1]\\n    ,                       EFUSE_BLK0,    56,    8,    Factory MAC addr [2]\\n    ,                       EFUSE_BLK0,    48,    8,    Factory MAC addr [3]\\n    ,                       EFUSE_BLK0,    40,    8,    Factory MAC addr [4]\\n    ,                       EFUSE_BLK0,    32,    8,    Factory MAC addr [5]\\n    MAC_FACTORY_CRC,        EFUSE_BLK0,    80,    8,    CRC8 for factory MAC address\\n\\nThis field is available in code as ``ESP_EFUSE_MAC_FACTORY`` and ``ESP_EFUSE_MAC_FACTORY_CRC``.\\n\\n.. _structured-efuse-fields:\\n\\nStructured eFuse Fields\\n-----------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    WR_DIS,                           EFUSE_BLK0,   0,    32,     Write protection\\n    WR_DIS.RD_DIS,                    EFUSE_BLK0,   0,    1,      Write protection for RD_DIS\\n    WR_DIS.FIELD_1,                   EFUSE_BLK0,   1,    1,      Write protection for FIELD_1\\n    WR_DIS.FIELD_2,                   EFUSE_BLK0,   2,    4,      Write protection for FIELD_2 (includes B1 and B2)\\n    WR_DIS.FIELD_2.B1,                EFUSE_BLK0,   2,    2,      Write protection for FIELD_2.B1\\n    WR_DIS.FIELD_2.B2,                EFUSE_BLK0,   4,    2,      Write protection for FIELD_2.B2\\n    WR_DIS.FIELD_3,                   EFUSE_BLK0,   5,    1,      Write protection for FIELD_3\\n    WR_DIS.FIELD_3.ALIAS,             EFUSE_BLK0,   5,    1,      Write protection for FIELD_3 (just a alias for WR_DIS.FIELD_3)\\n    WR_DIS.FIELD_4,                   EFUSE_BLK0,   7,    1,      Write protection for FIELD_4\\n\\nThe structured eFuse field looks like ``WR_DIS.RD_DIS`` where the dot points that this field belongs to the parent field - ``WR_DIS`` and cannot be out of the parent\\'s range.\\n\\nIt is possible to use some levels of structured fields as WR_DIS.FIELD_2.B1 and B2. These fields should not be crossed each other and should be in the range of two fields: ``WR_DIS`` and ``WR_DIS.FIELD_2``.\\n\\nIt is possible to create aliases for fields with the same range, see ``WR_DIS.FIELD_3`` and ``WR_DIS.FIELD_3.ALIAS``.\\n\\nThe ESP-IDF names for structured eFuse fields should be unique. The ``efuse_table_gen`` tool generates the final names where the dot is replaced by ``_``. The names for using in ESP-IDF are ESP_EFUSE_WR_DIS, ESP_EFUSE_WR_DIS_RD_DIS, ESP_EFUSE_WR_DIS_FIELD_2_B1, etc.\\n\\nThe ``efuse_table_gen`` tool checks that the fields do not overlap each other and must be within the range of a field if there is a violation, then throws the following error:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    Field at USER_DATA, EFUSE_BLK3, 0, 256  intersected with  SERIAL_NUMBER, EFUSE_BLK3, 0, 32\\n\\nSolution: Describe ``SERIAL_NUMBER`` to be included in ``USER_DATA``.

First of all, the check is carried out on the uniqueness of the names and overlaps of the field bits. If an additional `custom` file is used, it will be checked with the existing `common` file (esp_efuse_table.csv). In case of errors, a message will be displayed and the string that caused the error. C-source files contain structures of type `esp_efuse_desc_t`.\\n\\nTo generate a `common` files, use the following command ``idf.py efuse-common-table`` or:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    cd $IDF_PATH/components/efuse/\\n    ./efuse_table_gen.py --idf_target {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME} {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}/esp_efuse_table.csv\\n\\nAfter generation in the folder $IDF_PATH/components/efuse/`{IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}` create:\\n\\n* `esp_efuse_table.c` file.\\n* In `include` folder `esp_efuse_table.c` file.\\n\\nTo generate a `custom` files, use the following command ``idf.py efuse-custom-table`` or:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    cd $IDF_PATH/components/efuse/\\n    ./efuse_table_gen.py --idf_target {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME} {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}/esp_efuse_table.csv PROJECT_PATH/main/esp_efuse_custom_table.csv\\n\\nAfter generation in the folder PROJECT_PATH/main create:\\n\\n* `esp_efuse_custom_table.c` file.\\n* In `include` folder `esp_efuse_custom_table.c` file.\\n\\nTo use the generated fields, you need to include two files:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    #include \"esp_efuse.h\"\\n    #include \"esp_efuse_table.h\" // or \"esp_efuse_custom_table.h\"\\n\\n\\nSupported Coding Scheme\\n-----------------------\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    eFuse have three coding schemes:\\n\\n    * ``None`` (value 0).\\n    * ``3/4`` (value 1).\\n    * ``Repeat`` (value 2).\\n\\n    The coding scheme affects only EFUSE_BLK1, EFUSE_BLK2 and EFUSE_BLK3 blocks. EUSE_BLK0 block always has a coding scheme ``None``.\\n    Coding changes the number of bits that can be written into a block, the block length is constant 256, some of these bits are used for encoding and not avaliable for the user.\\n\\n    When using a coding scheme, the length of the payload that can be written is limited (for more details ``20.3.1.3 System Parameter coding_scheme``):\\n\\n    * None 256 bits.\\n    * 3/4 192 bits.\\n    * Repeat 128 bits.\\n\\n    You can find out the coding scheme of your chip:\\n\\n    * run a ``espefuse.py -p PORT summary`` command.\\n    * from ``esptool`` utility logs (during flashing).\\n    * calling the function in the code :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_get_coding_scheme` for the EFUSE_BLK3 block.\\n\\n    eFuse tables must always comply with the coding scheme in the chip. There is an :ref:`CONFIG_EFUSE_CODE_SCHEME_SELECTOR` option to select the coding type for tables in a Kconfig. When generating source files, if your tables do not follow the coding scheme, an error message will be displayed. Adjust the length or offset fields.\\n    If your program was compiled with ``None`` encoding and ``3/4`` is used in the chip, then the ``ESP_ERR_CODING`` error may occur when calling the eFuse API (the field is outside the block boundaries). If the field matches the new block boundaries, then the API will work without errors.\\n\\n    Also, 3/4 coding scheme imposes restrictions on writing bits belonging to one coding unit. The whole block with a length of 256 bits is divided into 4 coding units, and in each coding unit there are 6 bytes of useful data and 2 service bytes. These 2 service bytes contain the checksum of the previous 6 data bytes.\\n\\n    It turns out that only one field can be written into one coding unit. Repeated rewriting in one coding unit is prohibited. But if the record was made in advance or through a :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_write_block` function, then reading the fields belonging to one coding unit is possible.\\n\\n    In case ``3/4`` coding scheme, the writing process is divided into the coding units and we cannot use the usual mode of writing some fields. We can prepare all the data for writing and burn it in one time. You can also use this mode for ``None`` coding scheme but it is not necessary. It is important for ``3/4`` coding scheme.\\n    ``The batch writing mode`` blocks ``esp_efuse_read_...`` operations.\\n\\n    After changing the coding scheme, run ``efuse_common_table`` and ``efuse_custom_table`` commands to check the tables of the new coding scheme.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n    Coding schemes are used to protect against data corruption. {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports two coding schemes:\\n\\n    * ``None``. EFUSE_BLK0 is stored with four backups, meaning each bit is stored four times. This backup scheme is automatically applied by the hardware and is not visible to software. EFUSE_BLK0 can be written many times.\\n    * ``RS``. EFUSE_BLK1 - {IDF_TARGET_MAX_EFUSE_BLK} use Reed-Solomon coding scheme that supports up to 5 bytes of automatic error correction. Software encodes the 32-byte EFUSE_BLKx using RS (44, 32) to generate a 12-byte check code, and then burn the EFUSE_BLKx and the check code into eFuse at the same time. The eFuse Controller automatically decodes the RS encoding and applies error correction when reading back the eFuse block. Because the RS check codes are generated across the entire 256-bit eFuse block, each block can only be written to one time.\\n\\nTo write some fields into one block, or different blocks in one time, you need to use ``the batch writing mode``. Firstly set this mode through :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_batch_write_begin` function then write some fields as usual using the ``esp_efuse_write_...`` functions. At the end to burn them, call the :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_batch_write_commit` function. It burns prepared data to the eFuse blocks and disables the ``batch recording mode``.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    If there is already pre-written data in the eFuse block using the ``{IDF_TARGET_CODING_SCHEMES}`` encoding scheme, then it is not possible to write anything extra (even if the required bits are empty) without breaking the previous encoding data. This encoding data will be overwritten with new encoding data and completely destroyed (however, the payload eFuses are not damaged). It can be related to: CUSTOM_MAC, SPI_PAD_CONFIG_HD, SPI_PAD_CONFIG_CS, etc. Please contact Espressif to order the required pre-burnt eFuses.\\n\\n    FOR TESTING ONLY (NOT RECOMMENDED): You can ignore or suppress errors that violate encoding scheme data in order to burn the necessary bits in the eFuse block.\\n\\n.. _efuse_API:\\n\\neFuse API\\n---------\\n\\nAccess to the fields is via a pointer to the description structure. API functions have some basic operation:\\n\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_read_field_blob` - returns an array of read eFuse bits.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_read_field_cnt` - returns the number of bits programmed as \"1\".\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_write_field_blob` - writes an array.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_write_field_cnt` - writes a required count of bits as \"1\".\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_get_field_size` - returns the number of bits by the field name.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_read_reg` - returns value of eFuse register.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_write_reg` - writes value to eFuse register.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_get_coding_scheme` - returns eFuse coding scheme for blocks.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_read_block` - reads key to eFuse block starting at the offset and the required size.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_write_block` - writes key to eFuse block starting at the offset and the required size.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_batch_write_begin` - set the batch mode of writing fields.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_batch_write_commit` - writes all prepared data for batch writing mode and reset the batch writing mode.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_batch_write_cancel` - reset the batch writing mode and prepared data.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_get_key_dis_read` - Returns a read protection for the key block.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_set_key_dis_read` - Sets a read protection for the key block.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_get_key_dis_write` - Returns a write protection for the key block.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_set_key_dis_write` - Sets a write protection for the key block.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_get_key_purpose` - Returns the current purpose set for an eFuse key block.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_write_key` - Programs a block of key data to an eFuse block\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_write_keys` - Programs keys to unused eFuse blocks\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_find_purpose` - Finds a key block with the particular purpose set.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_get_keypurpose_dis_write` - Returns a write protection of the key purpose field for an eFuse key block (for esp32 always true).\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_key_block_unused` - Returns true if the key block is unused, false otherwise.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_destroy_block` - Destroys the data in this eFuse block. There are two things to do (1) if write protection is not set, then the remaining unset bits are burned, (2) set read protection for this block if it is not locked.\\n\\nFor frequently used fields, special functions are made, like this :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_get_pkg_ver`.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_EFUSE_KEY_PURPOSE_FIELD or SOC_SUPPORT_SECURE_BOOT_REVOKE_KEY\\n\\n    eFuse API for Keys\\n    ------------------\\n\\n    .. only:: SOC_EFUSE_KEY_PURPOSE_FIELD\\n\\n        EFUSE_BLK_KEY0 - EFUSE_BLK_KEY5 are intended to keep up to 6 keys with a length of 256-bits. Each key has an ``ESP_EFUSE_KEY_PURPOSE_x`` field which defines the purpose of these keys. The purpose field is described in :cpp:type:`esp_efuse_purpose_t`.\\n\\n        The purposes like ``ESP_EFUSE_KEY_PURPOSE_XTS_AES_...`` are used for flash encryption.\\n\\n        The purposes like ``ESP_EFUSE_KEY_PURPOSE_SECURE_BOOT_DIGEST...`` are used for secure boot.\\n\\n        There are some eFuse APIs useful to work with states of keys.\\n\\n        * :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_get_purpose_field` - Returns a pointer to a key purpose for an eFuse key block.\\n        * :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_get_key` - Returns a pointer to a key block.\\n        * :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_set_key_purpose` - Sets a key purpose for an eFuse key block.\\n        * :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_set_keypurpose_dis_write` - Sets a write protection of the key purpose field for an eFuse key block.\\n        * :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_find_unused_key_block` - Search for an unused key block and return the first one found.\\n        * :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_count_unused_key_blocks` - Returns the number of unused eFuse key blocks in the range EFUSE_BLK_KEY0..EFUSE_BLK_KEY_MAX\\n\\n    .. only:: SOC_SUPPORT_SECURE_BOOT_REVOKE_KEY\\n\\n        * :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_get_digest_revoke` - Returns the status of the Secure Boot public key digest revocation bit.\\n        * :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_set_digest_revoke` - Sets the Secure Boot public key digest revocation bit.\\n        * :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_get_write_protect_of_digest_revoke` - Returns a write protection of the Secure Boot public key digest revocation bit.\\n        * :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_set_write_protect_of_digest_revoke` - Sets a write protection of the Secure Boot public key digest revocation bit.\\n\\n\\nHow to Add a New Field\\n----------------------\\n\\n1. Find a free bits for field. Show `esp_efuse_table.csv` file or run ``idf.py show-efuse-table`` or the next command:\\n\\n.. include:: inc/show-efuse-table_{IDF_TARGET_NAME}.rst\\n\\nThe number of bits not included in square brackets is free (some bits are reserved for Espressif). All fields are checked for overlapping.\\n\\nTo add fields to an existing field, use the :ref:`Structured efuse fields <structured-efuse-fields>` technique. For example, adding the fields: SERIAL_NUMBER, MODEL_NUMBER and HARDWARE REV to an existing ``USER_DATA`` field. Use ``.`` (dot) to show an attachment in a field.\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    USER_DATA.SERIAL_NUMBER,                  EFUSE_BLK3,    0,  32,\\n    USER_DATA.MODEL_NUMBER,                   EFUSE_BLK3,    32, 10,\\n    USER_DATA.HARDWARE_REV,                   EFUSE_BLK3,    42, 10,\\n\\n2. Fill a line for field: field_name, efuse_block, bit_start, bit_count, comment.\\n\\n3. Run a ``show_efuse_table`` command to check eFuse table. To generate source files run ``efuse_common_table`` or ``efuse_custom_table`` command.\\n\\nYou may get errors such as ``intersects with`` or ``out of range``. Please see how to solve them in the :ref:`Structured efuse fields <structured-efuse-fields>` article.\\n\\nBit Order\\n---------\\n\\nThe eFuses bit order is little endian (see the example below), it means that eFuse bits are read and written from LSB to MSB:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    $ espefuse.py dump\\n\\n    USER_DATA      (BLOCK3          ) [3 ] read_regs: 03020100 07060504 0B0A0908 0F0E0D0C 13121111 17161514 1B1A1918 1F1E1D1C\\n    BLOCK4         (BLOCK4          ) [4 ] read_regs: 03020100 07060504 0B0A0908 0F0E0D0C 13121111 17161514 1B1A1918 1F1E1D1C\\n\\n    where is the register representation:\\n\\n    EFUSE_RD_USR_DATA0_REG = 0x03020100\\n    EFUSE_RD_USR_DATA1_REG = 0x07060504\\n    EFUSE_RD_USR_DATA2_REG = 0x0B0A0908\\n    EFUSE_RD_USR_DATA3_REG = 0x0F0E0D0C\\n    EFUSE_RD_USR_DATA4_REG = 0x13121111\\n    EFUSE_RD_USR_DATA5_REG = 0x17161514\\n    EFUSE_RD_USR_DATA6_REG = 0x1B1A1918\\n    EFUSE_RD_USR_DATA7_REG = 0x1F1E1D1C\\n\\n    where is the byte representation:\\n\\n    byte[0] = 0x00, byte[1] = 0x01, ... byte[3] = 0x03, byte[4] = 0x04, ..., byte[31] = 0x1F\\n\\nFor example, csv file describes the ``USER_DATA`` field, which occupies all 256 bits (a whole block).\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    USER_DATA,          EFUSE_BLK3,    0,  256,     User data\\n    USER_DATA.FIELD1,   EFUSE_BLK3,    16,  16,     Field1\\n\\n    ID,                 EFUSE_BLK4,    8,  3,      ID bit[0..2]\\n    ,                   EFUSE_BLK4,    16, 2,      ID bit[3..4]\\n    ,                   EFUSE_BLK4,    32, 3,      ID bit[5..7]\\n\\nThus, reading the eFuse ``USER_DATA`` block written as above gives the following results:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    uint8_t buf[32] = { 0 };\\n    esp_efuse_read_field_blob(ESP_EFUSE_USER_DATA, &buf, sizeof(buf) * 8);\\n    // buf[0] = 0x00, buf[1] = 0x01, ... buf[31] = 0x1F\\n\\n    uint32_t field1 = 0;\\n    size_t field1_size = ESP_EFUSE_USER_DATA[0]->bit_count; // can be used for this case because it only consists of one entry\\n    esp_efuse_read_field_blob(ESP_EFUSE_USER_DATA, &field1, field1_size);\\n    // field1 = 0x0302\\n\\n    uint32_t field1_1 = 0;\\n    esp_efuse_read_field_blob(ESP_EFUSE_USER_DATA, &field1_1, 2); // reads only first 2 bits\\n    // field1 = 0x0002\\n\\n    uint8_t id = 0;\\n    size_t id_size = esp_efuse_get_field_size(ESP_EFUSE_ID); // returns 6\\n    // size_t id_size = ESP_EFUSE_USER_DATA[0]->bit_count; // cannot be used because it consists of 3 entries. It returns 3 not 6.\\n    esp_efuse_read_field_blob(ESP_EFUSE_ID, &id, id_size);\\n    // id = 0x91\\n    // b\\'100 10  001\\n    //   [3] [2] [3]\\n\\n    uint8_t id_1 = 0;\\n    esp_efuse_read_field_blob(ESP_EFUSE_ID, &id_1, 3);\\n    // id = 0x01\\n    // b\\'001\\n\\nGet eFuses During Build\\n-----------------------\\n\\nThere is a way to get the state of eFuses at the build stage of the project. There are two cmake functions for this:\\n\\n* ``espefuse_get_json_summary()`` - It calls the ``espefuse.py summary --format json`` command and returns a json string (it is not stored in a file).\\n* ``espefuse_get_efuse()`` - It finds a given eFuse name in the json string and returns its property.\\n\\nThe json string has the following properties:\\n\\n.. code-block:: json\\n\\n    {\\n        \"MAC\": {\\n            \"bit_len\": 48,\\n            \"block\": 0,\\n            \"category\": \"identity\",\\n            \"description\": \"Factory MAC Address\",\\n            \"efuse_type\": \"bytes:6\",\\n            \"name\": \"MAC\",\\n            \"pos\": 0,\\n            \"readable\": true,\\n            \"value\": \"94:b9:7e:5a:6e:58 (CRC 0xe2 OK)\",\\n            \"word\": 1,\\n            \"writeable\": true\\n        },\\n    }\\n\\nThese functions can be used from a top-level project ``CMakeLists.txt`` (:example_file:`get-started/hello_world/CMakeLists.txt`):\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n    # ...\\n    project(hello_world)\\n\\n    espefuse_get_json_summary(efuse_json)\\n    espefuse_get_efuse(ret_data ${efuse_json} \"MAC\" \"value\")\\n    message(\"MAC:\" ${ret_data})\\n\\nThe format of the ``value`` property is the same as shown in ``espefuse.py summary``.\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    MAC:94:b9:7e:5a:6e:58 (CRC 0xe2 OK)\\n\\nThere is an example test :example_file:`system/efuse/CMakeLists.txt` which adds a custom target ``efuse-summary``. This allows you to run the ``idf.py efuse-summary`` command to read the required eFuses (specified in the ``efuse_names`` list) at any time, not just at project build time.\\n\\nDebug eFuse & Unit Tests\\n------------------------\\n\\n.. _virtual-efuses:\\n\\nVirtual eFuses\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_EFUSE_VIRTUAL` virtualizes eFuse values inside the eFuse Manager, so writes are emulated and no eFuse values are permanently changed. This can be useful for debugging app and unit tests.\\nDuring startup, the eFuses are copied to RAM. All eFuse operations (read and write) are performed with RAM instead of the real eFuse registers.\\n\\nIn addition to the :ref:`CONFIG_EFUSE_VIRTUAL` option there is :ref:`CONFIG_EFUSE_VIRTUAL_KEEP_IN_FLASH` option that adds a feature to keep eFuses in flash memory. To use this mode the partition_table should have the `efuse` partition. partition.csv: ``\"efuse_em, data, efuse,   ,   0x2000,\"``.\\nDuring startup, the eFuses are copied from flash or, in case if flash is empty, from real eFuse to RAM and then update flash. This option allows keeping eFuses after reboots (possible to test secure_boot and flash_encryption features with this option).\\n\\nFlash Encryption Testing\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nFlash Encryption (FE) is a hardware feature that requires the physical burning of eFuses: key and FLASH_CRYPT_CNT. If FE is not actually enabled then enabling the :ref:`CONFIG_EFUSE_VIRTUAL_KEEP_IN_FLASH` option just gives testing possibilities and does not encrypt anything in the flash, even though the logs say encryption happens. The :cpp:func:`bootloader_flash_write` is adapted for this purpose. But if FE is already enabled on the chip and you run an application or bootloader created with the :ref:`CONFIG_EFUSE_VIRTUAL_KEEP_IN_FLASH` option then the flash encryption/decryption operations will work properly (data are encrypted as it is written into an encrypted flash partition and decrypted when they are read from an encrypted partition).\\n\\n``espefuse.py``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nesptool includes a useful tool for reading/writing {IDF_TARGET_NAME} eFuse bits - `espefuse.py <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/{IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}/espefuse/index.html>`_.\\n\\n.. include:: inc/espefuse_summary_{IDF_TARGET_NAME}.rst\\n\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_efuse_chip.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_efuse.inc\\n',\n",
       " \"Event Loop Library\\n==================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nThe event loop library allows components to declare events so that other components can register handlers -- codes that executes when those events occur. This allows loosely-coupled components to attach desired behavior to state changes of other components without application involvement. This also simplifies event processing by serializing and deferring code execution to another context.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    One common case is, if a high-level library is using the Wi-Fi library: it may subscribe to :ref:`ESP32 Wi-Fi Programming Model <wifi-programming-model>` directly and act on those events.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_BT_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Various modules of the Bluetooth stack deliver events to applications via dedicated callback functions instead of via the Event Loop Library.\\n\\nUsing ``esp_event`` APIs\\n------------------------\\n\\nThere are two objects of concern for users of this library: events and event loops.\\n\\nAn event indicates an important occurrence, such as a successful Wi-Fi connection to an access point. A two-part identifier should be used when referencing events, see :ref:`declaring and defining events <esp-event-declaring-defining-events>` for details. The event loop is the bridge between events and event handlers. The event source publishes events to the event loop using the APIs provided by the event loop library, and event handlers registered to the event loop respond to specific types of events.\\n\\nUsing this library roughly entails the following flow:\\n\\n1. The user defines a function that should run when an event is posted to a loop. This function is referred to as the event handler, and should have the same signature as :cpp:type:`esp_event_handler_t`.\\n2. An event loop is created using :cpp:func:`esp_event_loop_create`, which outputs a handle to the loop of type :cpp:type:`esp_event_loop_handle_t`. Event loops created using this API are referred to as user event loops. There is, however, a special type of event loop called the default event loop which is discussed in :ref:`default event loop <esp-event-default-loops>`.\\n3. Components register event handlers to the loop using :cpp:func:`esp_event_handler_register_with`. Handlers can be registered with multiple loops, see :ref:`notes on handler registration <esp-event-handler-registration>`.\\n4. Event sources post an event to the loop using :cpp:func:`esp_event_post_to`.\\n5. Components wanting to remove their handlers from being called can do so by unregistering from the loop using :cpp:func:`esp_event_handler_unregister_with`.\\n6. Event loops that are no longer needed can be deleted using :cpp:func:`esp_event_loop_delete`.\\n\\nIn code, the flow above may look like as follows:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    // 1. Define the event handler\\n    void run_on_event(void* handler_arg, esp_event_base_t base, int32_t id, void* event_data)\\n    {\\n        // Event handler logic\\n    }\\n\\n    void app_main()\\n    {\\n        // 2. A configuration structure of type esp_event_loop_args_t is needed to specify the properties of the loop to be created. A handle of type esp_event_loop_handle_t is obtained, which is needed by the other APIs to reference the loop to perform their operations.\\n        esp_event_loop_args_t loop_args = {\\n            .queue_size = ...,\\n            .task_name = ...\\n            .task_priority = ...,\\n            .task_stack_size = ...,\\n            .task_core_id = ...\\n        };\\n\\n        esp_event_loop_handle_t loop_handle;\\n\\n        esp_event_loop_create(&loop_args, &loop_handle);\\n\\n        // 3. Register event handler defined in (1). MY_EVENT_BASE and MY_EVENT_ID specify a hypothetical event that handler run_on_event should execute when it gets posted to the loop.\\n        esp_event_handler_register_with(loop_handle, MY_EVENT_BASE, MY_EVENT_ID, run_on_event, ...);\\n\\n        ...\\n\\n        // 4. Post events to the loop. This queues the event on the event loop. At some point, the event loop executes the event handler registered to the posted event, in this case, run_on_event. To simplify the process, this example calls esp_event_post_to from app_main, but posting can be done from any other task (which is the more interesting use case).\\n        esp_event_post_to(loop_handle, MY_EVENT_BASE, MY_EVENT_ID, ...);\\n\\n        ...\\n\\n        // 5.

Deleting an unneeded event loop\\n        esp_event_loop_delete(loop_handle);\\n    }\\n\\n.. _esp-event-declaring-defining-events:\\n\\nDeclaring and Defining Events\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nAs mentioned previously, events consist of two-part identifiers: the event base and the event ID. The event base identifies an independent group of events; the event ID identifies the event within that group. Think of the event base and event ID as a person's last name and first name, respectively. A last name identifies a family, and the first name identifies a person within that family.\\n\\nThe event loop library provides macros to declare and define the event base easily.\\n\\nEvent base declaration:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    ESP_EVENT_DECLARE_BASE(EVENT_BASE);\\n\\nEvent base definition:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    ESP_EVENT_DEFINE_BASE(EVENT_BASE);\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    In ESP-IDF, the base identifiers for system events are uppercase and are postfixed with ``_EVENT``. For example, the base for Wi-Fi events is declared and defined as ``WIFI_EVENT``, the Ethernet event base ``ETHERNET_EVENT``, and so on. The purpose is to have event bases look like constants (although they are global variables considering the definitions of macros ``ESP_EVENT_DECLARE_BASE`` and ``ESP_EVENT_DEFINE_BASE``).\\n\\nFor event IDs, declaring them as enumerations is recommended. Once again, for visibility, these are typically placed in public header files.\\n\\nEvent ID:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    enum {\\n        EVENT_ID_1,\\n        EVENT_ID_2,\\n        EVENT_ID_3,\\n        ...\\n    }\\n\\n.. _esp-event-default-loops:\\n\\nDefault Event Loop\\n------------------\\n\\nThe default event loop is a special type of loop used for system events (Wi-Fi events, for example). The handle for this loop is hidden from the user, and the creation, deletion, handler registration/deregistration, and posting of events are done through a variant of the APIs for user event loops. The table below enumerates those variants, and the user event loops equivalent.\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n    :widths: 60 60\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    * - User Event Loops\\n      - Default Event Loops\\n    * - :cpp:func:`esp_event_loop_create`\\n      - :cpp:func:`esp_event_loop_create_default`\\n    * - :cpp:func:`esp_event_loop_delete`\\n      - :cpp:func:`esp_event_loop_delete_default`\\n    * - :cpp:func:`esp_event_handler_register_with`\\n      - :cpp:func:`esp_event_handler_register`\\n    * - :cpp:func:`esp_event_handler_unregister_with`\\n      - :cpp:func:`esp_event_handler_unregister`\\n    * - :cpp:func:`esp_event_post_to`\\n      - :cpp:func:`esp_event_post`\\n\\nIf you compare the signatures for both, they are mostly similar except for the lack of loop handle specification for the default event loop APIs.\\n\\nOther than the API difference and the special designation to which system events are posted, there is no difference in how default event loops and user event loops behave. It is even possible for users to post their own events to the default event loop, should the user opt to not create their own loops to save memory.\\n\\n.. _esp-event-handler-registration:\\n\\nNotes on Handler Registration\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nIt is possible to register a single handler to multiple events individually by using multiple calls to :cpp:func:`esp_event_handler_register_with`. For those multiple calls, the specific event base and event ID can be specified with which the handler should execute.\\n\\nHowever, in some cases, it is desirable for a handler to execute on the following situations:\\n\\n(1) all events that get posted to a loop\\n(2) all events of a particular base identifier\\n\\nThis is possible using the special event base identifier ``ESP_EVENT_ANY_BASE`` and special event ID ``ESP_EVENT_ANY_ID``. These special identifiers may be passed as the event base and event ID arguments for :cpp:func:`esp_event_handler_register_with`.\\n\\nTherefore, the valid arguments to :cpp:func:`esp_event_handler_register_with` are:\\n\\n1. <event base>, <event ID> - handler executes when the event with base <event base> and event ID <event ID> gets posted to the loop\\n2. <event base>, ESP_EVENT_ANY_ID - handler executes when any event with base <event base> gets posted to the loop\\n3. ESP_EVENT_ANY_BASE, ESP_EVENT_ANY_ID - handler executes when any event gets posted to the loop\\n\\nAs an example, suppose the following handler registrations were performed:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    esp_event_handler_register_with(loop_handle, MY_EVENT_BASE, MY_EVENT_ID, run_on_event_1, ...);\\n    esp_event_handler_register_with(loop_handle, MY_EVENT_BASE, ESP_EVENT_ANY_ID, run_on_event_2, ...);\\n    esp_event_handler_register_with(loop_handle, ESP_EVENT_ANY_BASE, ESP_EVENT_ANY_ID, run_on_event_3, ...);\\n\\nIf the hypothetical event ``MY_EVENT_BASE``, ``MY_EVENT_ID`` is posted, all three handlers ``run_on_event_1``, ``run_on_event_2``, and ``run_on_event_3`` would execute.\\n\\nIf the hypothetical event ``MY_EVENT_BASE``, ``MY_OTHER_EVENT_ID`` is posted, only  ``run_on_event_2`` and ``run_on_event_3`` would execute.\\n\\nIf the hypothetical event ``MY_OTHER_EVENT_BASE``, ``MY_OTHER_EVENT_ID`` is posted, only ``run_on_event_3`` would execute.\\n\\nHandler Un-Registering Itself\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn general, an event handler run by an event loop is **not allowed to do any registering/unregistering activity on that event loop**. There is one exception, though: un-registering itself is allowed for the handler. E.g., it is possible to do the following:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    void run_on_event(void* handler_arg, esp_event_base_t base, int32_t id, void* event_data)\\n    {\\n        esp_event_loop_handle_t *loop_handle = (esp_event_loop_handle_t*) handler_arg;\\n        esp_event_handler_unregister_with(*loop_handle, MY_EVENT_BASE, MY_EVENT_ID, run_on_event);\\n    }\\n\\n    void app_main(void)\\n    {\\n        esp_event_loop_handle_t loop_handle;\\n        esp_event_loop_create(&loop_args, &loop_handle);\\n        esp_event_handler_register_with(loop_handle, MY_EVENT_BASE, MY_EVENT_ID, run_on_event, &loop_handle);\\n        // ... post-event MY_EVENT_BASE, MY_EVENT_ID and run loop at some point\\n    }\\n\\n\\nHandler Registration and Handler Dispatch Order\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe general rule is that, for handlers that match a certain posted event during dispatch, those which are registered first also get executed first. The user can then control which handlers get executed first by registering them before other handlers, provided that all registrations are performed using a single task. If the user plans to take advantage of this behavior, caution must be exercised if there are multiple tasks registering handlers. While the 'first registered, first executed' behavior still holds true, the task which gets executed first also gets its handlers registered first. Handlers registered one after the other by a single task are still dispatched in the order relative to each other, but if that task gets pre-empted in between registration by another task that also registers handlers; then during dispatch those handlers also get executed in between.\\n\\n\\nEvent Loop Profiling\\n--------------------\\n\\nA configuration option :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_EVENT_LOOP_PROFILING` can be enabled in order to activate statistics collection for all event loops created. The function :cpp:func:`esp_event_dump` can be used to output the collected statistics to a file stream. More details on the information included in the dump can be found in the :cpp:func:`esp_event_dump` API Reference.\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\nExamples of using the ``esp_event`` library can be found in :example:`system/esp_event`. The examples cover event declaration, loop creation, handler registration and deregistration, and event posting.\\n\\nOther examples which also adopt ``esp_event`` library:\\n\\n    * :example:`NMEA Parser <peripherals/uart/nmea0183_parser>`, which decodes the statements received from GPS.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_event.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_event_base.inc\\n\\nRelated Documents\\n-----------------\\n\\n.. toctree::\\n    :maxdepth: 1\\n\",\n",
       " 'ESP HTTPS OTA\\n=============\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\n``esp_https_ota`` provides simplified APIs to perform firmware upgrades over HTTPS. It is an abstraction layer over the existing OTA APIs.\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        esp_err_t do_firmware_upgrade()\\n        {\\n            esp_http_client_config_t config = {\\n                .url = CONFIG_FIRMWARE_UPGRADE_URL,\\n                .cert_pem = (char *)server_cert_pem_start,\\n            };\\n            esp_https_ota_config_t ota_config = {\\n                .http_config = &config,\\n            };\\n            esp_err_t ret = esp_https_ota(&ota_config);\\n            if (ret == ESP_OK) {\\n                esp_restart();\\n            } else {\\n                return ESP_FAIL;\\n            }\\n            return ESP_OK;\\n        }\\n\\n\\nServer Verification\\n-------------------\\n\\nPlease refer to :ref:`ESP-TLS: TLS Server Verification <esp_tls_server_verification>` for more information on server verification. The root certificate in PEM format needs to be provided to the :cpp:member:`esp_http_client_config_t::cert_pem` member.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The server-endpoint **root** certificate should be used for verification instead of any intermediate ones from the certificate chain. The reason is that the root certificate has the maximum validity and usually remains the same for a long period of time. Users can also use the :cpp:member:`esp_http_client_config_t::crt_bundle_attach` member for verification by the ``ESP x509 Certificate Bundle`` feature, which covers most of the trusted root certificates.\\n\\nPartial Image Download over HTTPS\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nTo use the partial image download feature, enable ``partial_http_download`` configuration in ``esp_https_ota_config_t``. When this configuration is enabled, firmware image will be downloaded in multiple HTTP requests of specified sizes. Maximum content length of each request can be specified by setting ``max_http_request_size`` to the required value.\\n\\nThis option is useful while fetching image from a service like AWS S3, where mbedTLS Rx buffer size (:ref:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_SSL_IN_CONTENT_LEN`) can be set to a lower value which is not possible without enabling this configuration.\\n\\nDefault value of mbedTLS Rx buffer size is set to 16 KB. By using ``partial_http_download`` with ``max_http_request_size`` of 4 KB, size of mbedTLS Rx buffer can be reduced to 4 KB. With this configuration, memory saving of around 12 KB is expected.\\n\\n\\nSignature Verification\\n----------------------\\n\\nFor additional security, signature of OTA firmware images can be verified. For more information， please refer to :ref:`secure-ota-updates`.\\n\\n\\nAdvanced APIs\\n-------------\\n\\n``esp_https_ota`` also provides advanced APIs which can be used if more information and control is needed during the OTA process.\\n\\nExample that uses advanced ESP_HTTPS_OTA APIs: :example:`system/ota/advanced_https_ota`.\\n\\n\\n.. _ota_updates_pre-encrypted-firmware:\\n\\nOTA Upgrades with Pre-Encrypted Firmware\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nTo perform OTA upgrades with pre-encrypted firmware, please enable :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_HTTPS_OTA_DECRYPT_CB` in component menuconfig.\\n\\nExample that performs OTA upgrade with pre-encrypted firmware: :example:`system/ota/pre_encrypted_ota`.\\n\\n\\nOTA System Events\\n-----------------\\n\\nESP HTTPS OTA has various events for which a handler can be triggered by the :doc:`../system/esp_event` when the particular event occurs. The handler has to be registered using :cpp:func:`esp_event_handler_register`. This helps the event handling for ESP HTTPS OTA.\\n\\n:cpp:enum:`esp_https_ota_event_t` has all the events which can happen when performing OTA upgrade using ESP HTTPS OTA.\\n\\nEvent Handler Example\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        /* Event handler for catching system events */\\n        static void event_handler(void* arg, esp_event_base_t event_base,\\n                                int32_t event_id, void* event_data)\\n        {\\n            if (event_base == ESP_HTTPS_OTA_EVENT) {\\n                switch (event_id) {\\n                    case ESP_HTTPS_OTA_START:\\n                        ESP_LOGI(TAG, \"OTA started\");\\n                        break;\\n                    case ESP_HTTPS_OTA_CONNECTED:\\n                        ESP_LOGI(TAG, \"Connected to server\");\\n                        break;\\n                    case ESP_HTTPS_OTA_GET_IMG_DESC:\\n                        ESP_LOGI(TAG, \"Reading Image Description\");\\n                        break;\\n                    case ESP_HTTPS_OTA_VERIFY_CHIP_ID:\\n                        ESP_LOGI(TAG, \"Verifying chip id of new image: %d\", *(esp_chip_id_t *)event_data);\\n                        break;\\n                    case ESP_HTTPS_OTA_DECRYPT_CB:\\n                        ESP_LOGI(TAG, \"Callback to decrypt function\");\\n                        break;\\n                    case ESP_HTTPS_OTA_WRITE_FLASH:\\n                        ESP_LOGD(TAG, \"Writing to flash: %d written\", *(int *)event_data);\\n                        break;\\n                    case ESP_HTTPS_OTA_UPDATE_BOOT_PARTITION:\\n                        ESP_LOGI(TAG, \"Boot partition updated.

       " \"FreeRTOS (IDF)\\n==============\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThis document provides information regarding the dual-core SMP implementation of FreeRTOS inside ESP-IDF. This document is split into the following sections:\\n\\n.. contents:: Sections\\n  :depth: 2\\n\\n.. ---------------------------------------------------- Overview -------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nThe original FreeRTOS (hereinafter referred to as **Vanilla FreeRTOS**) is a compact and efficient real-time operating system supported on numerous single-core MCUs and SoCs. However, to support dual-core ESP targets, such as ESP32, ESP32-S3, and ESP32-P4, ESP-IDF provides a unique implementation of FreeRTOS with dual-core symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) capabilities (hereinafter referred to as **IDF FreeRTOS**).\\n\\nIDF FreeRTOS source code is based on Vanilla FreeRTOS v10.5.1 but contains significant modifications to both kernel behavior and API in order to support dual-core SMP. However, IDF FreeRTOS can also be configured for single-core by enabling the :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE` option (see :ref:`freertos-idf-single-core` for more details).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    This document assumes that the reader has a requisite understanding of Vanilla FreeRTOS, i.e., its features, behavior, and API usage. Refer to the `Vanilla FreeRTOS documentation <https://www.freertos.org/index.html>`_ for more details.\\n\\n.. -------------------------------------------- Symmetric Multiprocessing ----------------------------------------------\\n\\nSymmetric Multiprocessing\\n-------------------------\\n\\nBasic Concepts\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSymmetric multiprocessing is a computing architecture where two or more identical CPU cores are connected to a single shared main memory and controlled by a single operating system. In general, an SMP system:\\n\\n- has multiple cores running independently. Each core has its own register file, interrupts, and interrupt handling.\\n- presents an identical view of memory to each core. Thus, a piece of code that accesses a particular memory address has the same effect regardless of which core it runs on.\\n\\nThe main advantages of an SMP system compared to single-core or asymmetric multiprocessing systems are that:\\n\\n- the presence of multiple cores allows for multiple hardware threads, thus increasing overall processing throughput.\\n- having symmetric memory means that threads can switch cores during execution. This, in general, can lead to better CPU utilization.\\n\\nAlthough an SMP system allows threads to switch cores, there are scenarios where a thread must/should only run on a particular core. Therefore, threads in an SMP system also have a core affinity that specifies which particular core the thread is allowed to run on.\\n\\n- A thread that is pinned to a particular core is only able to run on that core.\\n- A thread that is unpinned will be allowed to switch between cores during execution instead of being pinned to a particular core.\\n\\nSMP on an ESP Target\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP targets such as ESP32, ESP32-S3, and ESP32-P4 are dual-core SMP SoCs. These targets have the following hardware features that make them SMP-capable:\\n\\n- Two identical cores are known as Core 0 and Core 1. This means that the execution of a piece of code is identical regardless of which core it runs on.\\n- Symmetric memory (with some small exceptions).\\n\\n  - If multiple cores access the same memory address simultaneously, their access will be serialized by the memory bus.\\n  - True atomic access to the same memory address is achieved via an atomic compare-and-swap instruction provided by the ISA.\\n\\n- Cross-core interrupts that allow one core to trigger an interrupt on the other core. This allows cores to signal events to each other (such as requesting a context switch on the other core).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Within ESP-IDF, Core 0 and Core 1 are sometimes referred to as ``PRO_CPU`` and ``APP_CPU`` respectively. The aliases exist in ESP-IDF as they reflect how typical ESP-IDF applications utilize the two cores. Typically, the tasks responsible for handling protocol related processing such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth are pinned to Core 0 (thus the name ``PRO_CPU``), where as the tasks handling the remainder of the application are pinned to Core 1, (thus the name ``APP_CPU``).\\n\\n.. ------------------------------------------------------ Tasks --------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTasks\\n-----\\n\\nCreation\\n^^^^^^^^\\n\\nVanilla FreeRTOS provides the following functions to create a task:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`xTaskCreate` creates a task. The task's memory is dynamically allocated.\\n- :cpp:func:`xTaskCreateStatic` creates a task. The task's memory is statically allocated, i.e., provided by the user.\\n\\nHowever, in an SMP system, tasks need to be assigned a particular affinity. Therefore, ESP-IDF provides a ``...PinnedToCore()`` version of Vanilla FreeRTOS's task creation functions:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`xTaskCreatePinnedToCore` creates a task with a particular core affinity. The task's memory is dynamically allocated.\\n- :cpp:func:`xTaskCreateStaticPinnedToCore` creates a task with a particular core affinity. The task's memory is statically allocated, i.e., provided by the user.\\n\\nThe ``...PinnedToCore()`` versions of the task creation function API differ from their vanilla counterparts by having an extra ``xCoreID`` parameter that is used to specify the created task's core affinity. The valid values for core affinity are:\\n\\n- ``0``, which pins the created task to Core 0\\n- ``1``, which pins the created task to Core 1\\n- ``tskNO_AFFINITY``, which allows the task to be run on both cores\\n\\nNote that IDF FreeRTOS still supports the vanilla versions of the task creation functions. However, these standard functions have been modified to essentially invoke their respective ``...PinnedToCore()`` counterparts while setting the core affinity to ``tskNO_AFFINITY``.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    IDF FreeRTOS also changes the units of ``ulStackDepth`` in the task creation functions. Task stack sizes in Vanilla FreeRTOS are specified in a number of words, whereas in IDF FreeRTOS, the task stack sizes are specified in bytes.\\n\\nExecution\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe anatomy of a task in IDF FreeRTOS is the same as in Vanilla FreeRTOS. More specifically, IDF FreeRTOS tasks:\\n\\n- Can only be in one of the following states: Running, Ready, Blocked, or Suspended.\\n- Task functions are typically implemented as an infinite loop.\\n- Task functions should never return.\\n\\nDeletion\\n^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTask deletion in Vanilla FreeRTOS is called via :cpp:func:`vTaskDelete`. The function allows deletion of another task or the currently running task if the provided task handle is ``NULL``. The actual freeing of the task's memory is sometimes delegated to the idle task if the task being deleted is the currently running task.\\n\\nIDF FreeRTOS provides the same :cpp:func:`vTaskDelete` function. However, due to the dual-core nature, there are some behavioral differences when calling :cpp:func:`vTaskDelete` in IDF FreeRTOS:\\n\\n- When deleting a task that is currently running on the other core, a yield is triggered on the other core, and the task's memory is freed by one of the idle tasks.\\n- A deleted task's memory is freed immediately if it is not running on either core.\\n\\nPlease avoid deleting a task that is running on another core as it is difficult to determine what the task is performing, which may lead to unpredictable behavior such as:\\n\\n- Deleting a task that is holding a mutex.\\n- Deleting a task that has yet to free memory it previously allocated.\\n\\nWhere possible, please design your own application so that when calling :cpp:func:`vTaskDelete`, the deleted task is in a known state. For example:\\n\\n- Tasks self-deleting via ``vTaskDelete(NULL)`` when their execution is complete and have also cleaned up all resources used within the task.\\n- Tasks placing themselves in the suspend state via :cpp:func:`vTaskSuspend` before being deleted by another task.\\n\\n\\n.. --------------------------------------------------- Scheduling ------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSMP Scheduler\\n-------------\\n\\nThe Vanilla FreeRTOS scheduler is best described as a **fixed priority preemptive scheduler with time slicing** meaning that:\\n\\n- Each task is given a constant priority upon creation. The scheduler executes the highest priority ready-state task.\\n- The scheduler can switch execution to another task without the cooperation of the currently running task.\\n- The scheduler periodically switches execution between ready-state tasks of the same priority in a round-robin fashion. Time slicing is governed by a tick interrupt.\\n\\nThe IDF FreeRTOS scheduler supports the same scheduling features, i.e., Fixed Priority, Preemption, and Time Slicing, albeit with some small behavioral differences.\\n\\nFixed Priority\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn Vanilla FreeRTOS, when the scheduler selects a new task to run, it always selects the current highest priority ready-state task. In IDF FreeRTOS, each core independently schedules tasks to run. When a particular core selects a task, the core will select the highest priority ready-state task that can be run by the core. A task can be run by the core if:\\n\\n- The task has a compatible affinity, i.e., is either pinned to that core or is unpinned.\\n- The task is not currently being run by another core.\\n\\nHowever, please do not assume that the two highest priority ready-state tasks are always run by the scheduler, as a task's core affinity must also be accounted for. For example, given the following tasks:\\n\\n- Task A of priority 10 pinned to Core 0\\n- Task B of priority 9 pinned to Core 0\\n- Task C of priority 8 pinned to Core 1\\n\\nThe resulting schedule will have Task A running on Core 0 and Task C running on Core 1. Task B is not run even though it is the second-highest priority task.\\n\\nPreemption\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn Vanilla FreeRTOS, the scheduler can preempt the currently running task if a higher priority task becomes ready to execute. Likewise in IDF FreeRTOS, each core can be individually preempted by the scheduler if the scheduler determines that a higher-priority task can run on that core.\\n\\nHowever, there are some instances where a higher-priority task that becomes ready can be run on multiple cores. In this case, the scheduler only preempts one core. The scheduler always gives preference to the current core when multiple cores can be preempted. In other words, if the higher priority ready task is unpinned and has a higher priority than the current priority of both cores, the scheduler will always choose to preempt the current core. For example, given the following tasks:\\n\\n- Task A of priority 8 currently running on Core 0\\n- Task B of priority 9 currently running on Core 1\\n- Task C of priority 10 that is unpinned and was unblocked by Task B\\n\\nThe resulting schedule will have Task A running on Core 0 and Task C preempting Task B given that the scheduler always gives preference to the current core.\\n\\nTime Slicing\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe Vanilla FreeRTOS scheduler implements time slicing, which means that if the current highest ready priority contains multiple ready tasks, the scheduler will switch between those tasks periodically in a round-robin fashion.\\n\\nHowever, in IDF FreeRTOS, it is not possible to implement perfect Round Robin time slicing due to the fact that a particular task may not be able to run on a particular core due to the following reasons:\\n\\n- The task is pinned to another core.\\n- For unpinned tasks, the task is already being run by another core.\\n\\nTherefore, when a core searches the ready-state task list for a task to run, the core may need to skip over a few tasks in the same priority list or drop to a lower priority in order to find a ready-state task that the core can run.\\n\\nThe IDF FreeRTOS scheduler implements a Best Effort Round Robin time slicing for ready-state tasks of the same priority by ensuring that tasks that have been selected to run are placed at the back of the list, thus giving unselected tasks a higher priority on the next scheduling iteration (i.e., the next tick interrupt or yield).\\n\\nThe following example demonstrates the Best Effort Round Robin time slicing in action. Assume that:\\n\\n- There are four ready-state tasks of the same priority ``AX``, ``B0``, ``C1``, and ``D1`` where:\\n\\n  - The priority is the current highest priority with ready-state .\\n  - The first character represents the task's name, i.e., ``A``, ``B``, ``C``, ``D``.\\n  - The second character represents the task's core pinning, and ``X`` means unpinned.\\n\\n- The task list is always searched from the head.\\n\\n1. Starting state. None of the ready-state tasks have been selected to run.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: none\\n\\n        Head [ AX , B0 , C1 , D0 ] Tail\\n\\n2. Core 0 has a tick interrupt and searches for a task to run. Task A is selected and moved to the back of the list.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: none\\n\\n        Core 0 ─┐\\n                ▼\\n        Head [ AX , B0 , C1 , D0 ] Tail\\n\\n                              [0]\\n        Head [ B0 , C1 , D0 , AX ] Tail\\n\\n3. Core 1 has a tick interrupt and searches for a task to run. Task B cannot be run due to incompatible affinity, so Core 1 skips to Task C. Task C is selected and moved to the back of the list.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: none\\n\\n        Core 1 ──────┐\\n                     ▼        [0]\\n        Head [ B0 , C1 , D0 , AX ] Tail\\n\\n                         [0]  [1]\\n        Head [ B0 , D0 , AX , C1 ] Tail\\n\\n4. Core 0 has another tick interrupt and searches for a task to run. Task B is selected and moved to the back of the list.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: none\\n\\n        Core 0 ─┐\\n                ▼             [1]\\n        Head [ B0 , D0 , AX , C1 ] Tail\\n\\n                         [1]  [0]\\n        Head [ D0 , AX , C1 , B0 ] Tail\\n\\n5. Core 1 has another tick and searches for a task to run. Task D cannot be run due to incompatible affinity, so Core 1 skips to Task A. Task A is selected and moved to the back of the list.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: none\\n\\n        Core 1 ──────┐\\n                     ▼        [0]\\n        Head [ D0 , AX , C1 , B0 ] Tail\\n\\n                         [0]  [1]\\n        Head [ D0 , C1 , B0 , AX ] Tail\\n\\nThe implications to users regarding the Best Effort Round Robin time slicing:\\n\\n- Users cannot expect multiple ready-state tasks of the same priority to run sequentially as is the case in Vanilla FreeRTOS. As demonstrated in the example above, a core may need to skip over tasks.\\n- However, given enough ticks, a task will eventually be given some processing time.\\n- If a core cannot find a task runnable task at the highest ready-state priority, it will drop to a lower priority to search for tasks.\\n- To achieve ideal round-robin time slicing, users should ensure that all tasks of a particular priority are pinned to the same core.\\n\\nTick Interrupts\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nVanilla FreeRTOS requires that a periodic tick interrupt occurs. The tick interrupt is responsible for:\\n\\n- Incrementing the scheduler's tick count\\n- Unblocking any blocked tasks that have timed out\\n- Checking if time slicing is required, i.e., triggering a context switch\\n- Executing the application tick hook\\n\\nIn IDF FreeRTOS, each core receives a periodic interrupt and independently runs the tick interrupt. The tick interrupts on each core are of the same period but can be out of phase. However, the tick responsibilities listed above are not run by all cores:\\n\\n- Core 0 executes all of the tick interrupt responsibilities listed above\\n- Core 1 only checks for time slicing and executes the application tick hook\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Core 0 is solely responsible for keeping time in IDF FreeRTOS. Therefore, anything that prevents Core 0 from incrementing the tick count, such as suspending the scheduler on Core 0, will cause the entire scheduler's timekeeping to lag behind.\\n\\nIdle Tasks\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nVanilla FreeRTOS will implicitly create an idle task of priority 0 when the scheduler is started. The idle task runs when no other task is ready to run, and it has the following responsibilities:\\n\\n- Freeing the memory of deleted tasks\\n- Executing the application idle hook\\n\\nIn IDF FreeRTOS, a separate pinned idle task is created for each core. The idle tasks on each core have the same responsibilities as their vanilla counterparts.\\n\\nScheduler Suspension\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nVanilla FreeRTOS allows the scheduler to be suspended/resumed by calling :cpp:func:`vTaskSuspendAll` and :cpp:func:`xTaskResumeAll` respectively. While the scheduler is suspended:\\n\\n- Task switching is disabled but interrupts are left enabled.\\n- Calling any blocking/yielding function is forbidden, and time slicing is disabled.\\n- The tick count is frozen, but the tick interrupt still occurs to execute the application tick hook.\\n\\nOn scheduler resumption, :cpp:func:`xTaskResumeAll` catches up all of the lost ticks and unblock any timed-out tasks.\\n\\nIn IDF FreeRTOS, suspending the scheduler across multiple cores is not possible. Therefore when :cpp:func:`vTaskSuspendAll` is called on a particular core (e.g., core A):\\n\\n- Task switching is disabled only on core A but interrupts for core A are left enabled.\\n- Calling any blocking/yielding function on core A is forbidden. Time slicing is disabled on core A.\\n- If an interrupt on core A unblocks any tasks, tasks with affinity to core A will go into core A's own pending ready task list. Unpinned tasks or tasks with affinity to other cores can be scheduled on cores with the scheduler running.\\n- If the scheduler is suspended on all cores, tasks unblocked by an interrupt will be directed to the pending ready task lists of their pinned cores. For unpinned tasks, they will be placed in the pending ready list of the core where the interrupt occurred.\\n- If core A is on Core 0, the tick count is frozen, and a pended tick count is incremented instead. However, the tick interrupt will still occur in order to execute the application tick hook.\\n\\nWhen :cpp:func:`xTaskResumeAll` is called on a particular core (e.g., core A):\\n\\n- Any tasks added to core A's pending ready task list will be resumed.\\n- If core A is Core 0, the pended tick count is unwound to catch up with the lost ticks.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    Given that scheduler suspension on IDF FreeRTOS only suspends scheduling on a particular core, scheduler suspension is **NOT** a valid method of ensuring mutual exclusion between tasks when accessing shared data. Users should use proper locking primitives such as mutexes or spinlocks if they require mutual exclusion.\\n\\n.. ------------------------------------------------ Critical Sections --------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCritical Sections\\n-----------------\\n\\nDisabling Interrupts\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nVanilla FreeRTOS allows interrupts to be disabled and enabled by calling :c:macro:`taskDISABLE_INTERRUPTS` and :c:macro:`taskENABLE_INTERRUPTS` respectively. IDF FreeRTOS provides the same API. However, interrupts are only disabled or enabled on the current core.\\n\\nDisabling interrupts is a valid method of achieving mutual exclusion in Vanilla FreeRTOS (and single-core systems in general). **However, in an SMP system, disabling interrupts is not a valid method of ensuring mutual exclusion**. Critical sections that utilize a spinlock should be used instead.\\n\\nAPI Changes\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nVanilla FreeRTOS implements critical sections by disabling interrupts, which prevents preemptive context switches and the servicing of ISRs during a critical section. Thus a task/ISR that enters a critical section is guaranteed to be the sole entity to access a shared resource. Critical sections in Vanilla FreeRTOS have the following API:\\n\\n- ``taskENTER_CRITICAL()`` enters a critical section by disabling interrupts\\n- ``taskEXIT_CRITICAL()`` exits a critical section by reenabling interrupts\\n- ``taskENTER_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR()`` enters a critical section from an ISR by disabling interrupt nesting\\n- ``taskEXIT_CRITICAL_FROM_ISR()`` exits a critical section from an ISR by reenabling interrupt nesting\\n\\nHowever, in an SMP system, merely disabling interrupts does not constitute a critical section as the presence of other cores means that a shared resource can still be concurrently accessed. Therefore, critical sections in IDF FreeRTOS are implemented using spinlocks. To accommodate the spinlocks, the IDF FreeRTOS critical section APIs contain an additional spinlock parameter as shown below:\\n\\n- Spinlocks are of ``portMUX_TYPE`` (**not to be confused to FreeRTOS mutexes**)\\n- ``taskENTER_CRITICAL(&spinlock)`` enters a critical from a task context\\n- ``taskEXIT_CRITICAL(&spinlock)`` exits a critical section from a task context\\n- ``taskENTER_CRITICAL_ISR(&spinlock)`` enters a critical section from an interrupt context\\n- ``taskEXIT_CRITICAL_ISR(&spinlock)`` exits a critical section from an interrupt context\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The critical section API can be called recursively, i.e., nested critical sections. Entering a critical section multiple times recursively is valid so long as the critical section is exited the same number of times it was entered. However, given that critical sections can target different spinlocks, users should take care to avoid deadlocking when entering critical sections recursively.\\n\\nSpinlocks can be allocated statically or dynamically. As such, macros are provided for both static and dynamic initialization of spinlocks, as demonstrated by the following code snippets.\\n\\n- Allocating a static spinlock and initializing it using ``portMUX_INITIALIZER_UNLOCKED``:\\n\\n  .. code:: c\\n\\n      // Statically allocate and initialize the spinlock\\n      static portMUX_TYPE my_spinlock = portMUX_INITIALIZER_UNLOCKED;\\n\\n      void some_function(void)\\n      {\\n          taskENTER_CRITICAL(&my_spinlock);\\n          // We are now in a critical section\\n          taskEXIT_CRITICAL(&my_spinlock);\\n      }\\n\\n- Allocating a dynamic spinlock and initializing it using ``portMUX_INITIALIZE()``:\\n\\n  .. code:: c\\n\\n      // Allocate the spinlock dynamically\\n      portMUX_TYPE *my_spinlock = malloc(sizeof(portMUX_TYPE));\\n      // Initialize the spinlock dynamically\\n      portMUX_INITIALIZE(my_spinlock);\\n\\n      ...\\n\\n      taskENTER_CRITICAL(my_spinlock);\\n      // Access the resource\\n      taskEXIT_CRITICAL(my_spinlock);\\n\\nImplementation\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn IDF FreeRTOS, the process of a particular core entering and exiting a critical section is as follows:\\n\\n- For ``taskENTER_CRITICAL(&spinlock)`` or ``taskENTER_CRITICAL_ISR(&spinlock)``\\n\\n  #. The core disables its interrupts or interrupt nesting up to ``configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY``.\\n  #. The core then spins on the spinlock using an atomic compare-and-set instruction until it acquires the lock. A lock is acquired when the core is able to set the lock's owner value to the core's ID.\\n  #. Once the spinlock is acquired, the function returns. The remainder of the critical section runs with interrupts or interrupt nesting disabled.\\n\\n- For ``taskEXIT_CRITICAL(&spinlock)`` or ``taskEXIT_CRITICAL_ISR(&spinlock)``\\n\\n  #. The core releases the spinlock by clearing the spinlock's owner value.\\n  #. The core re-enables interrupts or interrupt nesting.\\n\\nRestrictions and Considerations\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nGiven that interrupts (or interrupt nesting) are disabled during a critical section, there are multiple restrictions regarding what can be done within critical sections. During a critical section, users should keep the following restrictions and considerations in mind:\\n\\n- Critical sections should be kept as short as possible\\n\\n  - The longer the critical section lasts, the longer a pending interrupt can be delayed.\\n  - A typical critical section should only access a few data structures and/or hardware registers.\\n  - If possible, defer as much processing and/or event handling to the outside of critical sections.\\n\\n- FreeRTOS API should not be called from within a critical section\\n- Users should never call any blocking or yielding functions within a critical section\\n\\n\\n.. ------------------------------------------------------ Misc ---------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMisc\\n----\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_CPU_HAS_FPU\\n\\n    Floating Point Usage\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Usually, when a context switch occurs:\\n\\n    - the current state of a core's registers are saved to the stack of the task being switched out\\n    - the previously saved state of the core's registers is loaded from the stack of the task being switched in\\n\\n    However, IDF FreeRTOS implements Lazy Context Switching for the Floating Point Unit (FPU) registers of a core. In other words, when a context switch occurs on a particular core (e.g., Core 0), the state of the core's FPU registers is not immediately saved to the stack of the task getting switched out (e.g., Task A). The FPU registers are left untouched until:\\n\\n    - A different task (e.g., Task B) runs on the same core and uses FPU. This will trigger an exception that saves the FPU registers to Task A's stack.\\n    - Task A gets scheduled to the same core and continues execution. Saving and restoring the FPU registers is not necessary in this case.\\n\\n    However, given that tasks can be unpinned and thus can be scheduled on different cores (e.g., Task A switches to Core 1), it is unfeasible to copy and restore the FPU registers across cores. Therefore, when a task utilizes FPU by using a ``float`` type in its call flow, IDF FreeRTOS will automatically pin the task to the current core it is running on. This ensures that all tasks that use FPU are always pinned to a particular core.\\n\\n    Furthermore, IDF FreeRTOS by default does not support the usage of FPU within an interrupt context given that the FPU register state is tied to a particular task.\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32\\n\\n        .. note::\\n\\n            Users that require the use of the ``float`` type in an ISR routine should refer to the :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_FPU_IN_ISR` configuration option.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        ESP targets that contain an FPU do not support hardware acceleration for double precision floating point arithmetic (``double``). Instead, ``double`` is implemented via software, hence the behavioral restrictions regarding the ``float`` type do not apply to ``double``. Note that due to the lack of hardware acceleration, ``double`` operations may consume significantly more CPU time in comparison to ``float``.\\n\\n\\n.. -------------------------------------------------- Single Core  -----------------------------------------------------\\n\\n.. _freertos-idf-single-core:\\n\\nSingle-Core Mode\\n----------------\\n\\nAlthough IDF FreeRTOS is modified for dual-core SMP, IDF FreeRTOS can also be built for single-core by enabling the :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE` option.\\n\\nFor single-core targets (such as ESP32-S2 and ESP32-C3), the :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE` option is always enabled. For multi-core targets (such as ESP32 and ESP32-S3), :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE` can also be set, but will result in the application only running Core 0.\\n\\nWhen building in single-core mode, IDF FreeRTOS is designed to be identical to Vanilla FreeRTOS, thus all aforementioned SMP changes to kernel behavior are removed. As a result, building IDF FreeRTOS in single-core mode has the following characteristics:\\n\\n- All operations performed by the kernel inside critical sections are now deterministic (i.e., no walking of linked lists inside critical sections).\\n- Vanilla FreeRTOS scheduling algorithm is restored (including perfect Round Robin time slicing).\\n- All SMP specific data is removed from single-core builds.\\n\\nSMP APIs can still be called in single-core mode. These APIs remain exposed to allow source code to be built for single-core and multi-core, without needing to call a different set of APIs. However, SMP APIs will not exhibit any SMP behavior in single-core mode, thus becoming equivalent to their single-core counterparts. For example:\\n\\n- any ``...ForCore(..., BaseType_t xCoreID)`` SMP API will only accept ``0`` as a valid value for ``xCoreID``.\\n- ``...PinnedToCore()`` task creation APIs will simply ignore the ``xCoreID`` core affinity argument.\\n- Critical section APIs will still require a spinlock argument, but no spinlock will be taken and critical sections revert to simply disabling/enabling interrupts.\\n\\n\\n.. ------------------------------------------------- API References ----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\nThis section introduces FreeRTOS types, functions, and macros.

Each interrupt's priority is independently programmable. In addition, there are also 3 core local interrupt sources (CLINT) on each core. See **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#riscvcpu>`__] for more details.\\n\\nBecause there are more interrupt sources than interrupts, sometimes it makes sense to share an interrupt in multiple drivers. The :cpp:func:`esp_intr_alloc` abstraction exists to hide all these implementation details.\\n\\nA driver can allocate an interrupt for a certain peripheral by calling :cpp:func:`esp_intr_alloc` (or :cpp:func:`esp_intr_alloc_intrstatus`). It can use the flags passed to this function to specify the type, priority, and trigger method of the interrupt to allocate. The interrupt allocation code will then find an applicable interrupt, use the interrupt matrix to hook it up to the peripheral, and install the given interrupt handler and ISR to it.\\n\\nThe interrupt allocator presents two different types of interrupts, namely shared interrupts and non-shared interrupts, both of which require different handling. Non-shared interrupts will allocate a separate interrupt for every :cpp:func:`esp_intr_alloc` call, and this interrupt is use solely for the peripheral attached to it, with only one ISR that will get called. Shared interrupts can have multiple peripherals triggering them, with multiple ISRs being called when one of the peripherals attached signals an interrupt. Thus, ISRs that are intended for shared interrupts should check the interrupt status of the peripheral they service in order to check if any action is required.\\n\\nNon-shared interrupts can be either level- or edge-triggered. Shared interrupts can only be level interrupts due to the chance of missed interrupts when edge interrupts are used.\\n\\nTo illustrate why shard interrupts can only be level-triggered, take the scenario where peripheral A and peripheral B share the same edge-triggered interrupt. Peripheral B triggers an interrupt and sets its interrupt signal high, causing a low-to-high edge, which in turn latches the CPU's interrupt bit and triggers the ISR. The ISR executes, checks that peripheral A did not trigger an interrupt, and proceeds to handle and clear peripheral B's interrupt signal. Before the ISR returns, the CPU clears its interrupt bit latch. Thus, during the entire interrupt handling process, if peripheral A triggers an interrupt, it will be missed due the CPU clearing the interrupt bit latch.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32s3\\n\\n    Multicore Issues\\n    ----------------\\n\\n    Peripherals that can generate interrupts can be divided in two types:\\n\\n      - External peripherals, within the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} but outside the Xtensa cores themselves. Most {IDF_TARGET_NAME} peripherals are of this type.\\n      - Internal peripherals, part of the Xtensa CPU cores themselves.\\n\\n    Interrupt handling differs slightly between these two types of peripherals.\\n\\n    Internal Peripheral Interrupts\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Each Xtensa CPU core has its own set of six internal peripherals:\\n\\n      - Three timer comparators\\n      - A performance monitor\\n      - Two software interrupts\\n\\n    Internal interrupt sources are defined in ``esp_intr_alloc.h`` as ``ETS_INTERNAL_*_INTR_SOURCE``.\\n\\n    These peripherals can only be configured from the core they are associated with. When generating an interrupt, the interrupt they generate is hard-wired to their associated core; it is not possible to have, for example, an internal timer comparator of one core generate an interrupt on another core. That is why these sources can only be managed using a task running on that specific core. Internal interrupt sources are still allocatable using :cpp:func:`esp_intr_alloc` as normal, but they cannot be shared and will always have a fixed interrupt level (namely, the one associated in hardware with the peripheral).\\n\\n    External Peripheral Interrupts\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The remaining interrupt sources are from external peripherals.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32p4\\n\\n    Multicore Considerations\\n    ------------------------\\n\\n    Each core on {IDF_TARGET_NAME} provides internal interrupts that are triggered by the core itself and external interrupts that are triggered by peripherals. However, ESP-IDF only makes use of the external interrupts on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. Most {IDF_TARGET_NAME} interrupt sources are external interrupts.\\n\\n    Each external interrupt slot of each core is wired to the interrupt matrix. The interrupt matrix allows any interrupt slot to be connected to any external interrupt source. Mapping multiple external interrupts sources to a single slot is also supported. These external interrupt sources are defined in ``soc/interrupts.h`` as ``ETS_*_INTR_SOURCE``.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES\\n\\n    - Allocating an external interrupt will always allocate it on the core that does the allocation.\\n    - Freeing an external interrupt must always happen on the same core it was allocated on.\\n    - Disabling and enabling external interrupts from another core is allowed.\\n    - Multiple external interrupt sources can share an interrupt slot by passing ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_SHARED`` as a flag to :cpp:func:`esp_intr_alloc`.\\n\\n    Care should be taken when calling :cpp:func:`esp_intr_alloc` from a task which is not pinned to a core. During task switching, these tasks can migrate between cores. Therefore it is impossible to tell which CPU the interrupt is allocated on, which makes it difficult to free the interrupt handle and may also cause debugging difficulties. It is advised to use :cpp:func:`xTaskCreatePinnedToCore` with a specific CoreID argument to create tasks that allocate interrupts. In the case of internal interrupt sources, this is required.\\n\\n\\nIRAM-Safe Interrupt Handlers\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThe ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_IRAM`` flag registers an interrupt handler that always runs from IRAM (and reads all its data from DRAM), and therefore does not need to be disabled during flash erase and write operations.\\n\\nThis is useful for interrupts which need a guaranteed minimum execution latency, as flash write and erase operations can be slow (erases can take tens or hundreds of milliseconds to complete).\\n\\nIt can also be useful to keep an interrupt handler in IRAM if it is called very frequently, to avoid flash cache misses.\\n\\nRefer to the :ref:`SPI flash API documentation <iram-safe-interrupt-handlers>` for more details.\\n\\n.. _intr-alloc-shared-interrupts:\\n\\nMultiple Handlers Sharing A Source\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nSeveral handlers can be assigned to a same source, given that all handlers are allocated using the ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_SHARED`` flag. They will all be allocated to the interrupt, which the source is attached to, and called sequentially when the source is active. The handlers can be disabled and freed individually. The source is attached to the interrupt (enabled), if one or more handlers are enabled, otherwise detached. A handler will never be called when disabled, while **its source may still be triggered** if any one of its handler enabled.\\n\\nSources attached to non-shared interrupt do not support this feature.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_CPU_HAS_FLEXIBLE_INTC\\n\\n    By default, when ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_SHARED`` flag is specified, the interrupt allocator will allocate only priority level 1 interrupts. Use ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_SHARED | ESP_INTR_FLAG_LOWMED`` to also allow allocating shared interrupts at priority levels 2 and 3.\\n\\nThough the framework supports this feature, you have to use it **very carefully**. There usually exist two ways to stop an interrupt from being triggered: **disable the source** or **mask peripheral interrupt status**. ESP-IDF only handles enabling and disabling of the source itself, leaving status and mask bits to be handled by users.\\n\\n**Status bits shall either be masked before the handler responsible for it is disabled, or be masked and then properly handled in another enabled interrupt**.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Leaving some status bits unhandled without masking them, while disabling the handlers for them, will cause the interrupt(s) to be triggered indefinitely, resulting therefore in a system crash.\\n\\n\\nTroubleshooting Interrupt Allocation\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nOn most Espressif SoCs, CPU interrupts are a limited resource. Therefore it is possible for a program to run out of CPU interrupts, for example by initializing several peripheral drivers. Typically, this will result in the driver initialization function returning ``ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND`` error code.\\n\\nIf this happens, you can use :cpp:func:`esp_intr_dump` function to print the list of interrupts along with their status. The output of this function typically looks like this:\\n\\n.. code-block::\\n\\n    CPU 0 interrupt status:\\n    Int  Level  Type   Status\\n    0     1    Level  Reserved\\n    1     1    Level  Reserved\\n    2     1    Level  Used: RTC_CORE\\n    3     1    Level  Used: TG0_LACT_LEVEL\\n    ...\\n\\nThe columns of the output have the following meaning:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - ``Int``: CPU interrupt input number. This is typically not used in software directly, and is provided for reference only.\\n    :not SOC_CPU_HAS_FLEXIBLE_INTC: - ``Level``: Interrupt priority (1-7) of the CPU interrupt. This priority is fixed in hardware, and cannot be changed.\\n    :SOC_CPU_HAS_FLEXIBLE_INTC: - ``Level``: For interrupts which have been allocated, the priority of the interrupt. For free interrupts ``*`` is printed.\\n    :not SOC_CPU_HAS_FLEXIBLE_INTC: - ``Type``: Interrupt type (Level or Edge) of the CPU interrupt. This type is fixed in hardware, and cannot be changed.\\n    :SOC_CPU_HAS_FLEXIBLE_INTC: - ``Type``: For interrupts which have been allocated, the type (Level or Edge) of the interrupt. For free interrupts ``*`` is printed.\\n    - ``Status``: One of the possible statuses of the interrupt:\\n        - ``Reserved``: The interrupt is reserved either at hardware level, or by one of the parts of ESP-IDF. It can not be allocated using :cpp:func:`esp_intr_alloc`.\\n        - ``Used: <source>``: The interrupt is allocated and connected to a single peripheral.\\n        - ``Shared: <source1> <source2> ...``: The interrupt is allocated and connected to multiple peripherals. See :ref:`intr-alloc-shared-interrupts` above.\\n        - ``Free``: The interrupt is not allocated and can be used by :cpp:func:`esp_intr_alloc`.\\n        :not SOC_CPU_HAS_FLEXIBLE_INTC: - ``Free (not general-use)``: The interrupt is not allocated, but is either a high-priority interrupt (priority 4-7) or an edge-triggered interrupt. High-priority interrupts can be allocated using :cpp:func:`esp_intr_alloc` but requires the handlers to be written in Assembly, see :doc:`../../api-guides/hlinterrupts`. Edge-triggered low- and medium-priority interrupts can also be allocated using :cpp:func:`esp_intr_alloc`, but are not used often since most peripheral interrupts are level-triggered.\\n\\nIf you have confirmed that the application is indeed running out of interrupts, a combination of the following suggestions can help resolve the issue:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    :SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES: - On multi-core targets, try initializing some of the peripheral drivers from a task pinned to the second core. Interrupts are typically allocated on the same core where the peripheral driver initialization function runs. Therefore by running the initialization function on the second core, more interrupt inputs can be used.\\n    - Determine the interrupts which can tolerate higher latency, and allocate them using ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_SHARED`` flag (optionally ORed with ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_LOWMED``). Using this flag for two or more peripherals will let them use a single interrupt input, and therefore save interrupt inputs for other peripherals. See :ref:`intr-alloc-shared-interrupts` above.\\n    :not SOC_CPU_HAS_FLEXIBLE_INTC: - Some peripheral driver may default to allocating interrupts with ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_LEVEL1`` flag, so priority 2 and 3 interrupts do not get used by default. If :cpp:func:`esp_intr_dump` shows that some priority 2 or 3 interrupts are available, try changing the interrupt allocation flags when initializing the driver to ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_LEVEL2`` or ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_LEVEL3``.\\n    - Check if some of the peripheral drivers do not need to be used all the time, and initialize or deinitialize them on demand. This can reduce the number of simultaneously allocated interrupts.\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_intr_types.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_intr_alloc.inc\\n\",\n",
       " 'FreeRTOS (Supplemental Features)\\n================================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nESP-IDF provides multiple features to supplement the features offered by FreeRTOS. These supplemental features are available on all FreeRTOS implementations supported by ESP-IDF (i.e., ESP-IDF FreeRTOS and Amazon SMP FreeRTOS). This document describes these supplemental features and is split into the following sections:\\n\\n.. contents:: Contents\\n    :depth: 2\\n\\n.. ---------------------------------------------------- Overview -------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nESP-IDF adds various new features to supplement the capabilities of FreeRTOS as follows:\\n\\n- **Ring buffers**: Ring buffers provide a FIFO buffer that can accept entries of arbitrary lengths.\\n- **ESP-IDF Tick and Idle Hooks**: ESP-IDF provides multiple custom tick interrupt hooks and idle task hooks that are more numerous and more flexible when compared to FreeRTOS tick and idle hooks.\\n- **Thread Local Storage Pointer (TLSP) Deletion Callbacks**: TLSP Deletion callbacks are run automatically when a task is deleted, thus allowing users to clean up their TLSPs automatically.\\n- **IDF Additional API**: ESP-IDF specific functions added to augment the features of FreeRTOS.\\n- **Component Specific Properties**: Currently added only one component specific property ``ORIG_INCLUDE_PATH``.\\n\\n.. -------------------------------------------------- Ring Buffers -----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRing Buffers\\n------------\\n\\nFreeRTOS provides stream buffers and message buffers as the primary mechanisms to send arbitrarily sized data between tasks and ISRs. However, FreeRTOS stream buffers and message buffers have the following limitations:\\n\\n- Strictly single sender and single receiver\\n- Data is passed by copy\\n- Unable to reserve buffer space for a deferred send (i.e., send acquire)\\n\\nTherefore, ESP-IDF provides a separate ring buffer implementation to address the issues above.\\n\\nESP-IDF ring buffers are strictly FIFO buffers that supports arbitrarily sized items. Ring buffers are a more memory efficient alternative to FreeRTOS queues in situations where the size of items is variable. The capacity of a ring buffer is not measured by the number of items it can store, but rather by the amount of memory used for storing items.\\n\\nThe ring buffer provides APIs to send an item, or to allocate space for an item in the ring buffer to be filled manually by the user. For efficiency reasons, **items are always retrieved from the ring buffer by reference**. As a result, all retrieved items **must also be returned** to the ring buffer by using :cpp:func:`vRingbufferReturnItem` or :cpp:func:`vRingbufferReturnItemFromISR`, in order for them to be removed from the ring buffer completely.\\n\\nThe ring buffers are split into the three following types:\\n\\n**No-Split buffers** guarantee that an item is stored in contiguous memory and does not attempt to split an item under any circumstances. Use No-Split buffers when items must occupy contiguous memory. **Only this buffer type allows reserving buffer space for deferred sending.** Refer to the documentation of the functions :cpp:func:`xRingbufferSendAcquire` and :cpp:func:`xRingbufferSendComplete` for more details.\\n\\n**Allow-Split buffers** allow an item to be split in two parts when wrapping around the end of the buffer if there is enough space at the tail and the head of the buffer combined to store the item. Allow-Split buffers are more memory efficient than No-Split buffers but can return an item in two parts when retrieving.\\n\\n**Byte buffers** do not store data as separate items. All data is stored as a sequence of bytes, and any number of bytes can be sent or retrieved each time. Use byte buffers when separate items do not need to be maintained, e.g., a byte stream.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    No-Split buffers and Allow-Split buffers always store items at 32-bit aligned addresses. Therefore, when retrieving an item, the item pointer is guaranteed to be 32-bit aligned. This is useful especially when you need to send some data to the DMA.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Each item stored in No-Split or Allow-Split buffers **requires an additional 8 bytes for a header**. Item sizes are also rounded up to a 32-bit aligned size, i.e., multiple of 4 bytes. However the true item size is recorded within the header. The sizes of No-Split and Allow-Split buffers will also be rounded up when created.\\n\\nUsage\\n^^^^^\\n\\nThe following example demonstrates the usage of :cpp:func:`xRingbufferCreate` and :cpp:func:`xRingbufferSend` to create a ring buffer and then send an item to it:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    #include \"freertos/ringbuf.h\"\\n    static char tx_item[] = \"test_item\";\\n\\n    ...\\n\\n        //Create ring buffer\\n        RingbufHandle_t buf_handle;\\n        buf_handle = xRingbufferCreate(1028, RINGBUF_TYPE_NOSPLIT);\\n        if (buf_handle == NULL) {\\n            printf(\"Failed to create ring buffer\\\\n\");\\n        }\\n\\n        //Send an item\\n        UBaseType_t res =  xRingbufferSend(buf_handle, tx_item, sizeof(tx_item), pdMS_TO_TICKS(1000));\\n        if (res != pdTRUE) {\\n            printf(\"Failed to send item\\\\n\");\\n        }\\n\\nThe following example demonstrates the usage of :cpp:func:`xRingbufferSendAcquire` and :cpp:func:`xRingbufferSendComplete` instead of :cpp:func:`xRingbufferSend` to acquire memory on the ring buffer (of type :cpp:enumerator:`RINGBUF_TYPE_NOSPLIT`) and then send an item to it. This adds one more step, but allows getting the address of the memory to write to, and writing to the memory yourself.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    #include \"freertos/ringbuf.h\"\\n    #include \"soc/lldesc.h\"\\n\\n    typedef struct {\\n        lldesc_t dma_desc;\\n        uint8_t buf[1];\\n    } dma_item_t;\\n\\n    #define DMA_ITEM_SIZE(N) (sizeof(lldesc_t)+(((N)+3)&(~3)))\\n\\n    ...\\n\\n        //Retrieve space for DMA descriptor and corresponding data buffer\\n        //This has to be done with SendAcquire, or the address may be different when we copy\\n        dma_item_t item;\\n        UBaseType_t res =  xRingbufferSendAcquire(buf_handle,\\n                            &item, DMA_ITEM_SIZE(buffer_size), pdMS_TO_TICKS(1000));\\n        if (res != pdTRUE) {\\n            printf(\"Failed to acquire memory for item\\\\n\");\\n        }\\n        item->dma_desc = (lldesc_t) {\\n            .size = buffer_size,\\n            .length = buffer_size,\\n            .eof = 0,\\n            .owner = 1,\\n            .buf = &item->buf,\\n        };\\n        //Actually send to the ring buffer for consumer to use\\n        res = xRingbufferSendComplete(buf_handle, &item);\\n        if (res != pdTRUE) {\\n            printf(\"Failed to send item\\\\n\");\\n        }\\n\\nThe following example demonstrates retrieving and returning an item from a **No-Split ring buffer** using :cpp:func:`xRingbufferReceive` and :cpp:func:`vRingbufferReturnItem`\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    ...\\n\\n        //Receive an item from no-split ring buffer\\n        size_t item_size;\\n        char *item = (char *)xRingbufferReceive(buf_handle, &item_size, pdMS_TO_TICKS(1000));\\n\\n        //Check received item\\n        if (item != NULL) {\\n            //Print item\\n            for (int i = 0; i < item_size; i++) {\\n                printf(\"%c\", item[i]);\\n            }\\n            printf(\"\\\\n\");\\n            //Return Item\\n            vRingbufferReturnItem(buf_handle, (void *)item);\\n        } else {\\n            //Failed to receive item\\n            printf(\"Failed to receive item\\\\n\");\\n        }\\n\\n\\nThe following example demonstrates retrieving and returning an item from an **Allow-Split ring buffer** using :cpp:func:`xRingbufferReceiveSplit` and :cpp:func:`vRingbufferReturnItem`\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    ...\\n\\n        //Receive an item from allow-split ring buffer\\n        size_t item_size1, item_size2;\\n        char *item1, *item2;\\n        BaseType_t ret = xRingbufferReceiveSplit(buf_handle, (void **)&item1, (void **)&item2, &item_size1, &item_size2, pdMS_TO_TICKS(1000));\\n\\n        //Check received item\\n        if (ret == pdTRUE && item1 != NULL) {\\n            for (int i = 0; i < item_size1; i++) {\\n                printf(\"%c\", item1[i]);\\n            }\\n            vRingbufferReturnItem(buf_handle, (void *)item1);\\n            //Check if item was split\\n            if (item2 != NULL) {\\n                for (int i = 0; i < item_size2; i++) {\\n                    printf(\"%c\", item2[i]);\\n                }\\n                vRingbufferReturnItem(buf_handle, (void *)item2);\\n            }\\n            printf(\"\\\\n\");\\n        } else {\\n            //Failed to receive item\\n            printf(\"Failed to receive item\\\\n\");\\n        }\\n\\n\\nThe following example demonstrates retrieving and returning an item from a **byte buffer** using :cpp:func:`xRingbufferReceiveUpTo` and :cpp:func:`vRingbufferReturnItem`\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    ...\\n\\n        //Receive data from byte buffer\\n        size_t item_size;\\n        char *item = (char *)xRingbufferReceiveUpTo(buf_handle, &item_size, pdMS_TO_TICKS(1000), sizeof(tx_item));\\n\\n        //Check received data\\n        if (item != NULL) {\\n            //Print item\\n            for (int i = 0; i < item_size; i++) {\\n                printf(\"%c\", item[i]);\\n            }\\n            printf(\"\\\\n\");\\n            //Return Item\\n            vRingbufferReturnItem(buf_handle, (void *)item);\\n        } else {\\n            //Failed to receive item\\n            printf(\"Failed to receive item\\\\n\");\\n        }\\n\\n\\nFor ISR safe versions of the functions used above, call :cpp:func:`xRingbufferSendFromISR`, :cpp:func:`xRingbufferReceiveFromISR`, :cpp:func:`xRingbufferReceiveSplitFromISR`, :cpp:func:`xRingbufferReceiveUpToFromISR`, and :cpp:func:`vRingbufferReturnItemFromISR`.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Two calls to ``RingbufferReceive[UpTo][FromISR]()`` are required if the bytes wraps around the end of the ring buffer.\\n\\nSending to Ring Buffer\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe following diagrams illustrate the differences between No-Split and Allow-Split buffers as compared to byte buffers with regard to sending items or data. The diagrams assume that three items of sizes **18, 3, and 27 bytes** are sent respectively to a **buffer of 128 bytes**:\\n\\n.. packetdiag:: ../../../_static/diagrams/ring-buffer/ring_buffer_send_non_byte_buf.diag\\n    :caption: Sending items to No-Split or Allow-Split ring buffers\\n    :align: center\\n\\nFor No-Split and Allow-Split buffers, a header of 8 bytes precedes every data item. Furthermore, the space occupied by each item is **rounded up to the nearest 32-bit aligned size** in order to maintain overall 32-bit alignment. However, the true size of the item is recorded inside the header which will be returned when the item is retrieved.\\n\\nReferring to the diagram above, the 18, 3, and 27 byte items are **rounded up to 20, 4, and 28 bytes** respectively. An 8 byte header is then added in front of each item.\\n\\n.. packetdiag:: ../../../_static/diagrams/ring-buffer/ring_buffer_send_byte_buf.diag\\n    :caption: Sending items to byte buffers\\n    :align: center\\n\\nByte buffers treat data as a sequence of bytes and does not incur any overhead (no headers). As a result, all data sent to a byte buffer is merged into a single item.\\n\\nReferring to the diagram above, the 18, 3, and 27 byte items are sequentially written to the byte buffer and **merged into a single item of 48 bytes**.\\n\\nUsing SendAcquire and SendComplete\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nItems in No-Split buffers are acquired (by ``SendAcquire``) in strict FIFO order and must be sent to the buffer by ``SendComplete`` for the data to be accessible by the consumer. Multiple items can be sent or acquired without calling ``SendComplete``, and the items do not necessarily need to be completed in the order they were acquired. However, the receiving of data items must occur in FIFO order, therefore not calling ``SendComplete`` for the earliest acquired item prevents the subsequent items from being received.\\n\\nThe following diagrams illustrate what will happen when ``SendAcquire`` and ``SendComplete`` do not happen in the same order. At the beginning, there is already a data item of 16 bytes sent to the ring buffer. Then ``SendAcquire`` is called to acquire space of 20, 8, 24 bytes on the ring buffer.\\n\\n.. packetdiag:: ../../../_static/diagrams/ring-buffer/ring_buffer_send_acquire_complete.diag\\n    :caption: SendAcquire/SendComplete items in No-Split ring buffers\\n    :align: center\\n\\nAfter that, we fill (use) the buffers, and send them to the ring buffer by ``SendComplete`` in the order of 8, 24, 20. When 8 bytes and 24 bytes data are sent, the consumer still can only get the 16 bytes data item. Hence, if ``SendComplete`` is not called for the 20 bytes, it will not be available, nor will the data items following the 20 bytes item.\\n\\nWhen the 20 bytes item is finally completed, all the 3 data items can be received now, in the order of 20, 8, 24 bytes, right after the 16 bytes item existing in the buffer at the beginning.\\n\\nAllow-Split buffers and byte buffers do not allow using ``SendAcquire`` or ``SendComplete`` since acquired buffers are required to be complete (not wrapped).\\n\\n\\nWrap Around\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe following diagrams illustrate the differences between No-Split, Allow-Split, and byte buffers when a sent item requires a wrap around. The diagrams assume a buffer of **128 bytes** with **56 bytes of free space that wraps around** and a sent item of **28 bytes**.\\n\\n.. packetdiag:: ../../../_static/diagrams/ring-buffer/ring_buffer_wrap_no_split.diag\\n    :caption: Wrap around in No-Split buffers\\n    :align: center\\n\\nNo-Split buffers **only store an item in continuous free space and do not split an item under any circumstances**. When the free space at the tail of the buffer is insufficient to completely store the item and its header, the free space at the tail will be **marked as dummy data**. The buffer will then wrap around and store the item in the free space at the head of the buffer.\\n\\nReferring to the diagram above, the 16 bytes of free space at the tail of the buffer is insufficient to store the 28 byte item. Therefore, the 16 bytes is marked as dummy data and the item is written to the free space at the head of the buffer instead.\\n\\n.. packetdiag:: ../../../_static/diagrams/ring-buffer/ring_buffer_wrap_allow_split.diag\\n    :caption: Wrap around in Allow-Split buffers\\n    :align: center\\n\\nAllow-Split buffers will attempt to **split the item into two parts** when the free space at the tail of the buffer is insufficient to store the item data and its header. Both parts of the split item will have their own headers, therefore incurring an extra 8 bytes of overhead.\\n\\nReferring to the diagram above, the 16 bytes of free space at the tail of the buffer is insufficient to store the 28 byte item. Therefore, the item is split into two parts (8 and 20 bytes) and written as two parts to the buffer.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Allow-Split buffers treat both parts of the split item as two separate items, therefore call :cpp:func:`xRingbufferReceiveSplit` instead of :cpp:func:`xRingbufferReceive` to receive both parts of a split item in a thread safe manner.\\n\\n.. packetdiag:: ../../../_static/diagrams/ring-buffer/ring_buffer_wrap_byte_buf.diag\\n    :caption: Wrap around in byte buffers\\n    :align: center\\n\\nByte buffers **store as much data as possible into the free space at the tail of buffer**. The remaining data will then be stored in the free space at the head of the buffer. No overhead is incurred when wrapping around in byte buffers.\\n\\nReferring to the diagram above, the 16 bytes of free space at the tail of the buffer is insufficient to completely store the 28 bytes of data. Therefore, the 16 bytes of free space is filled with data, and the remaining 12 bytes are written to the free space at the head of the buffer. The buffer now contains data in two separate continuous parts, and each continuous part is treated as a separate item by the byte buffer.\\n\\nRetrieving/Returning\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe following diagrams illustrate the differences between No-Split and Allow-Split buffers as compared to byte buffers in retrieving and returning data:\\n\\n.. packetdiag:: ../../../_static/diagrams/ring-buffer/ring_buffer_read_ret_non_byte_buf.diag\\n    :caption: Retrieving/Returning items in No-Split and Allow-Split ring buffers\\n    :align: center\\n\\nItems in No-Split buffers and Allow-Split buffers are **retrieved in strict FIFO order** and **must be returned** for the occupied space to be freed. Multiple items can be retrieved before returning, and the items do not necessarily need to be returned in the order they were retrieved. However, the freeing of space must occur in FIFO order, therefore not returning the earliest retrieved item prevents the space of subsequent items from being freed.\\n\\nReferring to the diagram above, the **16, 20, and 8 byte items are retrieved in FIFO order**. However, the items are not returned in the order they were retrieved. First, the 20 byte item is returned followed by the 8 byte and the 16 byte items. The space is not freed until the first item, i.e., the 16 byte item is returned.\\n\\n.. packetdiag:: ../../../_static/diagrams/ring-buffer/ring_buffer_read_ret_byte_buf.diag\\n    :caption: Retrieving/Returning data in byte buffers\\n    :align: center\\n\\nByte buffers **do not allow multiple retrievals before returning** (every retrieval must be followed by a return before another retrieval is permitted). When using :cpp:func:`xRingbufferReceive` or :cpp:func:`xRingbufferReceiveFromISR`, all continuous stored data will be retrieved. :cpp:func:`xRingbufferReceiveUpTo` or :cpp:func:`xRingbufferReceiveUpToFromISR` can be used to restrict the maximum number of bytes retrieved. Since every retrieval must be followed by a return, the space is freed as soon as the data is returned.\\n\\nReferring to the diagram above, the 38 bytes of continuous stored data at the tail of the buffer is retrieved, returned, and freed. The next call to :cpp:func:`xRingbufferReceive` or :cpp:func:`xRingbufferReceiveFromISR` then wraps around and does the same to the 30 bytes of continuous stored data at the head of the buffer.\\n\\nRing Buffers with Queue Sets\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nRing buffers can be added to FreeRTOS queue sets using :cpp:func:`xRingbufferAddToQueueSetRead` such that every time a ring buffer receives an item or data, the queue set is notified. Once added to a queue set, every attempt to retrieve an item from a ring buffer should be preceded by a call to :cpp:func:`xQueueSelectFromSet`. To check whether the selected queue set member is the ring buffer, call :cpp:func:`xRingbufferCanRead`.\\n\\nThe following example demonstrates queue set usage with ring buffers:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    #include \"freertos/queue.h\"\\n    #include \"freertos/ringbuf.h\"\\n\\n    ...\\n\\n        //Create ring buffer and queue set\\n        RingbufHandle_t buf_handle = xRingbufferCreate(1028, RINGBUF_TYPE_NOSPLIT);\\n        QueueSetHandle_t queue_set = xQueueCreateSet(3);\\n\\n        //Add ring buffer to queue set\\n        if (xRingbufferAddToQueueSetRead(buf_handle, queue_set) != pdTRUE) {\\n            printf(\"Failed to add to queue set\\\\n\");\\n        }\\n\\n    ...\\n\\n        //Block on queue set\\n        QueueSetMemberHandle_t member = xQueueSelectFromSet(queue_set, pdMS_TO_TICKS(1000));\\n\\n        //Check if member is ring buffer\\n        if (member != NULL && xRingbufferCanRead(buf_handle, member) == pdTRUE) {\\n            //Member is ring buffer, receive item from ring buffer\\n            size_t item_size;\\n            char *item = (char *)xRingbufferReceive(buf_handle, &item_size, 0);\\n\\n            //Handle item\\n            ...\\n\\n        } else {\\n            ...\\n        }\\n\\nRing Buffers with Static Allocation\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe :cpp:func:`xRingbufferCreateStatic` can be used to create ring buffers with specific memory requirements (such as a ring buffer being allocated in external RAM). All blocks of memory used by a ring buffer must be manually allocated beforehand, then passed to the :cpp:func:`xRingbufferCreateStatic` to be initialized as a ring buffer. These blocks include the following:\\n\\n- The ring buffer\\'s data structure of type :cpp:type:`StaticRingbuffer_t`.\\n- The ring buffer\\'s storage area of size ``xBufferSize``. Note that ``xBufferSize`` must be 32-bit aligned for No-Split and Allow-Split buffers.\\n\\nThe manner in which these blocks are allocated depends on the users requirements (e.g., all blocks being statically declared, or dynamically allocated with specific capabilities such as external RAM).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    When deleting a ring buffer created via :cpp:func:`xRingbufferCreateStatic`, the function :cpp:func:`vRingbufferDelete` will not free any of the memory blocks. This must be done manually by the user after :cpp:func:`vRingbufferDelete` is called.\\n\\nThe code snippet below demonstrates a ring buffer being allocated entirely in external RAM.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    #include \"freertos/ringbuf.h\"\\n    #include \"freertos/semphr.h\"\\n    #include \"esp_heap_caps.h\"\\n\\n    #define BUFFER_SIZE     400      //32-bit aligned size\\n    #define BUFFER_TYPE     RINGBUF_TYPE_NOSPLIT\\n    ...\\n\\n    //Allocate ring buffer data structure and storage area into external RAM\\n    StaticRingbuffer_t *buffer_struct = (StaticRingbuffer_t *)heap_caps_malloc(sizeof(StaticRingbuffer_t), MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM);\\n    uint8_t *buffer_storage = (uint8_t *)heap_caps_malloc(sizeof(uint8_t)*BUFFER_SIZE, MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM);\\n\\n    //Create a ring buffer with manually allocated memory\\n    RingbufHandle_t handle = xRingbufferCreateStatic(BUFFER_SIZE, BUFFER_TYPE, buffer_storage, buffer_struct);\\n\\n    ...\\n\\n    //Delete the ring buffer after used\\n    vRingbufferDelete(handle);\\n\\n    //Manually free all blocks of memory\\n    free(buffer_struct);\\n    free(buffer_storage);\\n\\n\\n.. ------------------------------------------- ESP-IDF Tick and Idle Hooks ---------------------------------------------\\n\\nESP-IDF Tick and Idle Hooks\\n---------------------------\\n\\nFreeRTOS allows applications to provide a tick hook and an idle hook at compile time:\\n\\n- FreeRTOS tick hook can be enabled via the :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_USE_TICK_HOOK` option. The application must provide the ``void vApplicationTickHook( void )`` callback.\\n- FreeRTOS idle hook can be enabled via the :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_USE_IDLE_HOOK` option. The application must provide the ``void vApplicationIdleHook( void )`` callback.\\n\\nHowever, the FreeRTOS tick hook and idle hook have the following draw backs:\\n\\n- The FreeRTOS hooks are registered at compile time\\n- Only one of each hook can be registered\\n- On multi-core targets, the FreeRTOS hooks are symmetric, meaning each core\\'s tick interrupt and idle tasks ends up calling the same hook\\n\\nTherefore, ESP-IDF tick and idle hooks are provided to supplement the features of FreeRTOS tick and idle hooks. The ESP-IDF hooks have the following features:\\n\\n- The hooks can be registered and deregistered at run-time\\n- Multiple hooks can be registered (with a maximum of 8 hooks of each type per core)\\n- On multi-core targets, the hooks can be asymmetric, meaning different hooks can be registered to each core\\n\\nESP-IDF hooks can be registered and deregistered using the following APIs:\\n\\n- For tick hooks:\\n\\n    - Register using :cpp:func:`esp_register_freertos_tick_hook` or :cpp:func:`esp_register_freertos_tick_hook_for_cpu`\\n    - Deregister using :cpp:func:`esp_deregister_freertos_tick_hook` or :cpp:func:`esp_deregister_freertos_tick_hook_for_cpu`\\n\\n- For idle hooks:\\n\\n    - Register using :cpp:func:`esp_register_freertos_idle_hook` or :cpp:func:`esp_register_freertos_idle_hook_for_cpu`\\n    - Deregister using :cpp:func:`esp_deregister_freertos_idle_hook` or :cpp:func:`esp_deregister_freertos_idle_hook_for_cpu`\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The tick interrupt stays active while the cache is disabled, therefore any tick hook (FreeRTOS or ESP-IDF) functions must be placed in internal RAM. Please refer to the :ref:`SPI flash API documentation <iram-safe-interrupt-handlers>` for more details.\\n\\n.. -------------------------------------------------- TLSP Callback ----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTLSP Deletion Callbacks\\n-----------------------\\n\\nVanilla FreeRTOS provides a Thread Local Storage Pointers (TLSP) feature. These are pointers stored directly in the Task Control Block (TCB) of a particular task. TLSPs allow each task to have its own unique set of pointers to data structures. Vanilla FreeRTOS expects users to:\\n\\n- set a task\\'s TLSPs by calling :cpp:func:`vTaskSetThreadLocalStoragePointer` after the task has been created.\\n- get a task\\'s TLSPs by calling :cpp:func:`pvTaskGetThreadLocalStoragePointer` during the task\\'s lifetime.\\n- free the memory pointed to by the TLSPs before the task is deleted.\\n\\nHowever, there can be instances where users may want the freeing of TLSP memory to be automatic. Therefore, ESP-IDF provides the additional feature of TLSP deletion callbacks. These user-provided deletion callbacks are called automatically when a task is deleted, thus allowing the TLSP memory to be cleaned up without needing to add the cleanup logic explicitly to the code of every task.\\n\\nThe TLSP deletion callbacks are set in a similar fashion to the TLSPs themselves.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`vTaskSetThreadLocalStoragePointerAndDelCallback` sets both a particular TLSP and its associated callback.\\n- Calling the Vanilla FreeRTOS function :cpp:func:`vTaskSetThreadLocalStoragePointer` simply sets the TLSP\\'s associated Deletion Callback to `NULL`, meaning that no callback is called for that TLSP during task deletion.\\n\\nWhen implementing TLSP callbacks, users should note the following:\\n\\n- The callback **must never attempt to block or yield** and critical sections should be kept as short as possible.\\n- The callback is called shortly before a deleted task\\'s memory is freed. Thus, the callback can either be called from :cpp:func:`vTaskDelete` itself, or from the idle task.\\n\\n.. --------------------------------------------- ESP-IDF Additional API ------------------------------------------------\\n\\n.. _freertos-idf-additional-api:\\n\\nIDF Additional API\\n------------------\\n\\nThe :component_file:`freertos/esp_additions/include/freertos/idf_additions.h` header contains FreeRTOS-related helper functions added by ESP-IDF.

       " 'Heap Memory Allocation\\n======================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nStack and Heap\\n--------------\\n\\nESP-IDF applications use the common computer architecture patterns of **stack** (dynamic memory allocated by program control flow), **heap** (dynamic memory allocated by function calls), and **static memory** (memory allocated at compile time).\\n\\nBecause ESP-IDF is a multi-threaded RTOS environment, each RTOS task has its own stack. By default, each of these stacks is allocated from the heap when the task is created. See :cpp:func:`xTaskCreateStatic` for the alternative where stacks are statically allocated.\\n\\nBecause {IDF_TARGET_NAME} uses multiple types of RAM, it also contains multiple heaps with different capabilities. A capabilities-based memory allocator allows apps to make heap allocations for different purposes.\\n\\nFor most purposes, the C Standard Library\\'s ``malloc()`` and ``free()`` functions can be used for heap allocation without any special consideration. However, in order to fully make use of all of the memory types and their characteristics, ESP-IDF also has a capabilities-based heap memory allocator. If you want to have a memory with certain properties (e.g., :ref:`dma-capable-memory` or executable-memory), you can create an OR-mask of the required capabilities and pass that to :cpp:func:`heap_caps_malloc`.\\n\\n.. _memory_capabilities:\\n\\nMemory Capabilities\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe {IDF_TARGET_NAME} contains multiple types of RAM:\\n\\n- DRAM (Data RAM) is memory that is connected to CPU\\'s data bus and is used to hold data. This is the most common kind of memory accessed as a heap.\\n- IRAM (Instruction RAM) is memory that is connected to the CPU\\'s instruction bus and usually holds executable data only (i.e., instructions). If accessed as generic memory, all accesses must be aligned to :ref:`32-Bit Accessible Memory <32-Bit Accessible Memory>`.\\n- D/IRAM is RAM that is connected to CPU\\'s data bus and instruction bus, thus can be used either Instruction or Data RAM.\\n\\nFor more details on these internal memory types, see :ref:`memory-layout`.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPIRAM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    It is also possible to connect external SPI RAM to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. The :doc:`external RAM </api-guides/external-ram>` is integrated into the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s memory map via the cache, and accessed similarly to DRAM.\\n\\nAll DRAM memory is single-byte accessible, thus all DRAM heaps possess the ``MALLOC_CAP_8BIT`` capability. Users can call ``heap_caps_get_free_size(MALLOC_CAP_8BIT)`` to get the free size of all DRAM heaps.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    If ran out of ``MALLOC_CAP_8BIT``, the users can use ``MALLOC_CAP_IRAM_8BIT`` instead. In that case, IRAM can still be used as a \"reserve\" pool of internal memory if the users only access it in a 32-bit aligned manner, or if they enable ``CONFIG_ESP32_IRAM_AS_8BIT_ACCESSIBLE_MEMORY)``.\\n\\n\\nWhen calling ``malloc()``, the ESP-IDF ``malloc()`` internally calls ``heap_caps_malloc_default(size)``. This will allocate memory with the capability ``MALLOC_CAP_DEFAULT``, which is byte-addressable.\\n\\nBecause ``malloc()`` uses the capabilities-based allocation system, memory allocated using :cpp:func:`heap_caps_malloc` can be freed by calling the standard ``free()`` function.\\n\\nAvailable Heap\\n--------------\\n\\n.. _dram-definition:\\n\\nDRAM\\n^^^^\\n\\nAt startup, the DRAM heap contains all data memory that is not statically allocated by the app. Reducing statically-allocated buffers increases the amount of available free heap.\\n\\nTo find the amount of statically allocated memory, use the :ref:`idf.py size <idf.py-size>` command.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        See the :ref:`dram` section for more details about the DRAM usage limitations.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    At runtime, the available heap DRAM may be less than calculated at compile time, because, at startup, some memory is allocated from the heap before the FreeRTOS scheduler is started (including memory for the stacks of initial FreeRTOS tasks).\\n\\nIRAM\\n^^^^\\n\\nAt startup, the IRAM heap contains all instruction memory that is not used by the app executable code.\\n\\nThe :ref:`idf.py size <idf.py-size>` command can be used to find the amount of IRAM used by the app.\\n\\nD/IRAM\\n^^^^^^\\n\\nSome memory in the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is available as either DRAM or IRAM. If memory is allocated from a D/IRAM region, the free heap size for both types of memory will decrease.\\n\\nHeap Sizes\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAt startup, all ESP-IDF apps log a summary of all heap addresses (and sizes) at level Info:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    I (252) heap_init: Initializing. RAM available for dynamic allocation:\\n    I (259) heap_init: At 3FFAE6E0 len 00001920 (6 KiB): DRAM\\n    I (265) heap_init: At 3FFB2EC8 len 0002D138 (180 KiB): DRAM\\n    I (272) heap_init: At 3FFE0440 len 00003AE0 (14 KiB): D/IRAM\\n    I (278) heap_init: At 3FFE4350 len 0001BCB0 (111 KiB): D/IRAM\\n    I (284) heap_init: At 4008944C len 00016BB4 (90 KiB): IRAM\\n\\nFinding Available Heap\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSee :ref:`heap-information`.\\n\\nSpecial Capabilities\\n--------------------\\n\\n.. _dma-capable-memory:\\n\\nDMA-Capable Memory\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nUse the ``MALLOC_CAP_DMA`` flag to allocate memory which is suitable for use with hardware DMA engines (for example SPI and I2S). This capability flag excludes any external PSRAM.\\n\\n.. only SOC_SPIRAM_SUPPORTED and not esp32::\\n\\n    The EDMA hardware feature allows DMA buffers to be placed in external PSRAM, but there may be additional alignment constraints. Consult the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual for details. To allocate a DMA-capable external memory buffer, use the ``MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM`` capabilities flag together with :cpp:func:`heap_caps_aligned_alloc` with the necessary alignment specified.\\n\\n.. _32-bit accessible memory:\\n\\n32-Bit Accessible Memory\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf a certain memory structure is only addressed in 32-bit units, for example, an array of ints or pointers, it can be useful to allocate it with the ``MALLOC_CAP_32BIT`` flag. This also allows the allocator to give out IRAM memory, which is sometimes unavailable for a normal ``malloc()`` call. This can help to use all the available memory in the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_XTENSA and SOC_CPU_HAS_FPU\\n\\n    Please note that on {IDF_TARGET_NAME} series chips, ``MALLOC_CAP_32BIT`` cannot be used for storing floating-point variables. This is because ``MALLOC_CAP_32BIT`` may return instruction RAM and the floating-point assembly instructions on {IDF_TARGET_NAME} cannot access instruction RAM.\\n\\nMemory allocated with ``MALLOC_CAP_32BIT`` can **only** be accessed via 32-bit reads and writes, any other type of access will generate a fatal LoadStoreError exception.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPIRAM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    External SPI Memory\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    When :doc:`external RAM </api-guides/external-ram>` is enabled, external SPI RAM can be allocated using standard ``malloc`` calls, or via ``heap_caps_malloc(MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM)``, depending on the configuration. See :ref:`external_ram_config` for more details.\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32\\n\\n        On ESP32 only external SPI RAM under 4 MiB in size can be allocated this way. To use the region above the 4 MiB limit, you can use the :doc:`himem API </api-reference/system/himem>`.\\n\\nThread Safety\\n-------------\\n\\nHeap functions are thread-safe, meaning they can be called from different tasks simultaneously without any limitations.\\n\\nIt is technically possible to call ``malloc``, ``free``, and related functions from interrupt handler (ISR) context (see :ref:`calling-heap-related-functions-from-isr`). However, this is not recommended, as heap function calls may delay other interrupts. It is strongly recommended to refactor applications so that any buffers used by an ISR are pre-allocated outside of the ISR. Support for calling heap functions from ISRs may be removed in a future update.\\n\\n.. _calling-heap-related-functions-from-isr:\\n\\nCalling Heap-Related Functions from ISR\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nThe following functions from the heap component can be called from the interrupt handler (ISR):\\n\\n* :cpp:func:`heap_caps_malloc`\\n* :cpp:func:`heap_caps_malloc_default`\\n* :cpp:func:`heap_caps_realloc_default`\\n* :cpp:func:`heap_caps_malloc_prefer`\\n* :cpp:func:`heap_caps_realloc_prefer`\\n* :cpp:func:`heap_caps_calloc_prefer`\\n* :cpp:func:`heap_caps_free`\\n* :cpp:func:`heap_caps_realloc`\\n* :cpp:func:`heap_caps_calloc`\\n* :cpp:func:`heap_caps_aligned_alloc`\\n* :cpp:func:`heap_caps_aligned_free`\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    However, this practice is strongly discouraged.\\n\\nHeap Tracing & Debugging\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe following features are documented on the :doc:`Heap Memory Debugging </api-reference/system/heap_debug>` page:\\n\\n- :ref:`Heap Information <heap-information>` (free space, etc.)\\n- :ref:`Heap Allocation and Free Function Hooks <heap-allocation-free>`\\n- :ref:`Heap Corruption Detection <heap-corruption>`\\n- :ref:`Heap Tracing <heap-tracing>` (memory leak detection, monitoring, etc.)\\n\\nImplementation Notes\\n--------------------\\n\\nKnowledge about the regions of memory in the chip comes from the \"SoC\" component, which contains memory layout information for the chip, and the different capabilities of each region. Each region\\'s capabilities are prioritized, so that (for example) dedicated DRAM and IRAM regions are used for allocations ahead of the more versatile D/IRAM regions.\\n\\nEach contiguous region of memory contains its own memory heap. The heaps are created using the :ref:`multi_heap <multi-heap>` functionality. ``multi_heap`` allows any contiguous region of memory to be used as a heap.\\n\\nThe heap capabilities allocator uses knowledge of the memory regions to initialize each individual heap. Allocation functions in the heap capabilities API will find the most appropriate heap for the allocation based on desired capabilities, available space, and preferences for each region\\'s use, and then calling :cpp:func:`multi_heap_malloc` for the heap situated in that particular region.\\n\\nCalling ``free()`` involves finding the particular heap corresponding to the freed address, and then call :cpp:func:`multi_heap_free` on that particular ``multi_heap`` instance.\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference - Heap Allocation\\n-------------------------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_heap_caps.inc\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference - Initialisation\\n------------------------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_heap_caps_init.inc\\n\\n.. _multi-heap:\\n\\nAPI Reference - Multi-Heap API\\n------------------------------\\n\\n(Note: The multi-heap API is used internally by the heap capabilities allocator.

Whereas DMA accesses the memory directly, without going through cache.\\n\\nThis leads to potential cache data coherence issue:\\n\\n- When a DMA transaction changes the content of a piece of memory, and the content has been cached already. Under this condition:\\n\\n   - CPU may read stale data.\\n   - the stale data in the cache may be written back to the memory. The new data updated by the previous DMA transaction will be overwritten.\\n\\n- CPU changes the content of an address. The content is in the cache, but not in the memory yet (cache will write back the content to the memory according to its own strategy). Under this condition:\\n\\n   - The next DMA transactions to read this content from the memory will get stale data.\\n\\nThere are three common methods to address such cache data coherence issue:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n   1. Hardware based cache Coherent Interconnect, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} does not have such ability.\\n   2. Use the DMA buffer from non-cacheable memory. Memory that CPU access it without going through cache is called non-cacheable memory.\\n   3. Explicitly call a memory synchronization API to writeback the content in the cache back to the memory, or invalidate the content in the cache.\\n\\n\\nMemory Synchronisation Driver\\n=============================\\n\\nThe suggested way to deal with such cache data coherence issue is by using the memory synchronization API :cpp:func:`esp_cache_msync` provided by ESP-IDF `esp_mm` component.\\n\\n\\nDriver Concept\\n--------------\\n\\nDirection of the cache memory synchronization:\\n\\n- :c:macro:`ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_DIR_C2M`, for synchronization from cache to memory.\\n- :c:macro:`ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_DIR_M2C`, for synchronization from memory to cache.\\n\\nType of the cache memory synchronization:\\n\\n- :c:macro:`ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_TYPE_DATA`, for synchronization to a data address region.\\n- :c:macro:`ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_TYPE_INST`, for synchronization to an instruction address region.\\n\\n\\nDriver Behaviour\\n----------------\\n\\nCalling :cpp:func:`esp_cache_msync` will do a synchronization between cache and memory. The first parameter `addr` and the second parameter `size` together describe the memory region that is to be synchronized. About the third parameter `flags`:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n   - :c:macro:`ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_DIR_C2M`. With this flag, content in the specified address region is written back to the memory. This direction is usually used **after** the content of an address is updated by the CPU, e.g. a memset to the address. Operation in this direction should happen **before** a DMA operation to the same address.\\n   - :c:macro:`ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_DIR_M2C`. With this flag, content in the specified address region is invalidated from the cache. This direction is usually used **after** the content of an address is updated by the DMA. Operation in this direction should happen **before** a CPU read operation to the same address.\\n\\nThe above two flags help select the synchronization direction. Specially, if neither of these two flags are used, :cpp:func:`esp_cache_msync` will by default select the :c:macro:`ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_DIR_C2M` direction. Users are not allowed to set both of the two flags at the same time.\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n   - :c:macro:`ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_TYPE_DATA`.\\n   - :c:macro:`ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_TYPE_INST`.\\n\\nThe above two flags help select the type of the synchronization address. Specially, if neither of these two flags are used, :cpp:func:`esp_cache_msync` will by default select the :c:macro:`ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_TYPE_DATA` direction. Users are not allowed to set both of the two flags at the same time.\\n\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n   - :c:macro:`ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_INVALIDATE`. This flag is used to trigger a cache invalidation to the specified address region, after the region is written back to the memory. This flag is mainly used for :c:macro:`ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_DIR_C2M` direction. For :c:macro:`ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_DIR_M2C` direction, behaviour is the same as if the :c:macro:`ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_INVALIDATE` flag is not set.\\n   - :c:macro:`ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_UNALIGNED`. This flag force the :cpp:func:`esp_cache_msync` API to do synchronization without checking the address and size alignment. For more details, see chapter `Address Alignment Requirement` following.\\n\\n\\nAddress Alignment Requirement\\n=============================\\n\\nThere is address and size alignment requirement (in bytes) for using :cpp:func:`esp_cache_msync`. The alignment requirement comes from cache.\\n\\n- An address region whose start address and size both meet the cache memory synchronization alignment requirement is defined as an **aligned address region**.\\n- An address region whose start address or size does not meet the cache memory synchronization alignment requirement is defined as an **unaligned address region**.\\n\\nBy default, if you specify an unaligned address region, :cpp:func:`esp_cache_msync` will return an :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG` error, together with the required alignment.\\n\\n\\nMemory Allocation Helper\\n------------------------\\n\\ncache memory synchronization is usually considered when DMA is involved. ESP-IDF provides an API to do memory allocation that can meet the alignment requirement from both the cache and the DMA.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_dma_malloc`, this API allocates a chunk of memory that meets the alignment requirement from both the cache and the DMA.\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_dma_calloc`, this API allocates a chunk of memory that meets the alignment requirement from both the cache and the DMA. The initialized value in the memory is set to zero.\\n\\nYou can also use :c:macro:`ESP_DMA_MALLOC_FLAG_PSRAM` to allocate from the PSRAM.\\n\\n\\nWarning for Address Alignment Requirement\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nYou can set the :c:macro:`ESP_CACHE_MSYNC_FLAG_UNALIGNED` flag to bypass such check.

       " 'ULP RISC-V Coprocessor Programming\\n==================================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThe ULP RISC-V coprocessor is a variant of the ULP present in {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. Similar to ULP FSM, the ULP RISC-V coprocessor can perform tasks such as sensor readings while the main CPU stays in low power modes. The main difference between ULP FSM and ULP RISC-V is that the latter can be programmed in C using standard GNU tools. The ULP RISC-V coprocessor can access the RTC_SLOW_MEM memory region, and registers in ``RTC_CNTL``, ``RTC_IO``, and ``SARADC`` peripherals. The RISC-V processor is a 32-bit fixed point machine. Its instruction set is based on RV32IMC which includes hardware multiplication and division, and compressed code.\\n\\nInstalling the ULP RISC-V Toolchain\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nThe ULP RISC-V coprocessor code is written in C (assembly is also possible) and compiled using the RISC-V toolchain based on GCC.\\n\\nIf you have already set up ESP-IDF with CMake build system according to the :doc:`Getting Started Guide <../../../get-started/index>`, then the toolchain should already be installed.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    In earlier versions of ESP-IDF, RISC-V toolchain had a different prefix: ``riscv-none-embed-gcc``.\\n\\nCompiling the ULP RISC-V Code\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nTo compile the ULP RISC-V code as part of the component, the following steps must be taken:\\n\\n1. The ULP RISC-V code, written in C or assembly (must use the ``.S`` extension), must be placed in a separate directory inside the component directory, for instance, ``ulp/``.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    When registering the component (via ``idf_component_register``), this directory should not be added to the ``SRC_DIRS`` argument as it is currently done for the ULP FSM. See the step below for how to properly add ULP source files.\\n\\n2. Call ``ulp_embed_binary`` from the component CMakeLists.txt after registration. For example::\\n\\n    ...\\n    idf_component_register()\\n\\n    set(ulp_app_name ulp_${COMPONENT_NAME})\\n    set(ulp_sources \"ulp/ulp_c_source_file.c\" \"ulp/ulp_assembly_source_file.S\")\\n    set(ulp_exp_dep_srcs \"ulp_c_source_file.c\")\\n\\n    ulp_embed_binary(${ulp_app_name} \"${ulp_sources}\" \"${ulp_exp_dep_srcs}\")\\n\\n The first argument to ``ulp_embed_binary`` specifies the ULP binary name. The name specified here will also be used by other generated artifacts such as the ELF file, map file, header file, and linker export file. The second argument specifies the ULP source files. Finally, the third argument specifies the list of component source files which include the header file to be generated. This list is needed to build the dependencies correctly and ensure that the generated header file will be created before any of these files are compiled. See the section below for the concept of generated header files for ULP applications.\\n\\n3. Build the application as usual (e.g., ``idf.py app``).\\n\\n   Inside, the build system will take the following steps to build ULP program:\\n\\n   1. **Run each source file through the C compiler and assembler.** This step generates the object files (``.obj.c`` or ``.obj.S`` depending of source file processed) in the component build directory.\\n\\n   2. **Run the linker script template through the C preprocessor.** The template is located in ``components/ulp/ld`` directory.\\n\\n   3. **Link the object files into an output ELF file** (``ulp_app_name.elf``). The Map file (``ulp_app_name.map``) generated at this stage may be useful for debugging purposes.\\n\\n   4. **Dump the contents of the ELF file into a binary** (``ulp_app_name.bin``) which can then be embedded into the application.\\n\\n   5. **Generate a list of global symbols** (``ulp_app_name.sym``) in the ELF file using ``riscv32-esp-elf-nm``.\\n\\n   6. **Create an LD export script and a header file** (``ulp_app_name.ld`` and ``ulp_app_name.h``) containing the symbols from ``ulp_app_name.sym``. This is done using the ``esp32ulp_mapgen.py`` utility.\\n\\n   7. **Add the generated binary to the list of binary files** to be embedded into the application.\\n\\n.. _ulp-riscv-access-variables:\\n\\nAccessing the ULP RISC-V Program Variables\\n------------------------------------------\\n\\nGlobal symbols defined in the ULP RISC-V program may be used inside the main program.\\n\\nFor example, the ULP RISC-V program may define a variable ``measurement_count`` which will define the number of ADC measurements the program needs to make before waking up the chip from deep sleep.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    volatile int measurement_count;\\n\\n    int some_function()\\n    {\\n        //read the measurement count for later use.\\n        int temp = measurement_count;\\n\\n        ...do something.\\n    }\\n\\nThe main program can access the global ULP RISC-V program variables as the build system makes this possible by generating the ``${ULP_APP_NAME}.h`` and ``${ULP_APP_NAME}.ld`` files which define the global symbols present in the ULP RISC-V program. Each global symbol defined in the ULP RISC-V program is included in these files and are prefixed with ``ulp_``.\\n\\nThe header file contains the declaration of the symbol:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    extern uint32_t ulp_measurement_count;\\n\\nNote that all symbols (variables, arrays, functions) are declared as ``uint32_t``. For functions and arrays, take the address of the symbol and cast it to the appropriate type.\\n\\nThe generated linker script file defines the locations of symbols in RTC_SLOW_MEM::\\n\\n    PROVIDE ( ulp_measurement_count = 0x50000060 );\\n\\nTo access the ULP RISC-V program variables from the main program, the generated header file should be included using an ``include`` statement. This will allow the ULP RISC-V program variables to be accessed as regular variables.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    #include \"ulp_app_name.h\"\\n\\n    void init_ulp_vars() {\\n        ulp_measurement_count = 64;\\n    }\\n\\nMutual Exclusion\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf mutual exclusion is needed when accessing a variable shared between the main program and ULP, then this can be achieved by using the ULP RISC-V lock API:\\n\\n * :cpp:func:`ulp_riscv_lock_acquire`\\n * :cpp:func:`ulp_riscv_lock_release`\\n\\nThe ULP does not have any hardware instructions to facilitate mutual exclusion, so the lock API achieves this through a software algorithm (`Peterson\\'s algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterson%27s_algorithm>`_).\\n\\nThe locks are intended to only be called from a single thread in the main program, and will not provide mutual exclusion if used simultaneously from multiple threads.\\n\\nStarting the ULP RISC-V Program\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nTo run a ULP RISC-V program, the main application needs to load the ULP program into RTC memory using the :cpp:func:`ulp_riscv_load_binary` function, and then start it using the :cpp:func:`ulp_riscv_run` function.\\n\\nNote that the ``CONFIG_ULP_COPROC_ENABLED`` and ``CONFIG_ULP_COPROC_TYPE_RISCV`` options must be enabled in menuconfig to work with ULP RISC-V. To reserve memory for the ULP, the ``RTC slow memory reserved for coprocessor`` option must be set to a value big enough to store ULP RISC-V code and data. If the application components contain multiple ULP programs, then the size of the RTC memory must be sufficient to hold the largest one.\\n\\nEach ULP RISC-V program is embedded into the ESP-IDF application as a binary blob. The application can reference this blob and load it in the following way (suppose ULP_APP_NAME was defined to ``ulp_app_name``):\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    extern const uint8_t bin_start[] asm(\"_binary_ulp_app_name_bin_start\");\\n    extern const uint8_t bin_end[]   asm(\"_binary_ulp_app_name_bin_end\");\\n\\n    void start_ulp_program() {\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK( ulp_riscv_load_binary( bin_start,\\n            (bin_end - bin_start)) );\\n    }\\n\\nOnce the program is loaded into RTC memory, the application can start it by calling the :cpp:func:`ulp_riscv_run` function:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK( ulp_riscv_run() );\\n\\nULP RISC-V Program Flow\\n-----------------------\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_RTC_CLK_FRE:default=\"150 kHz\", esp32s2=\"90 kHz\", esp32s3=\"136 kHz\"}\\n\\nThe ULP RISC-V coprocessor is started by a timer. The timer is started once :cpp:func:`ulp_riscv_run` is called. The timer counts the number of RTC_SLOW_CLK ticks (by default, produced by an internal {IDF_TARGET_RTC_CLK_FRE} RC oscillator). The number of ticks is set using ``RTC_CNTL_ULP_CP_TIMER_1_REG`` register. When starting the ULP, ``RTC_CNTL_ULP_CP_TIMER_1_REG`` will be used to set the number of timer ticks.\\n\\nThe application can set ULP timer period values (RTC_CNTL_ULP_CP_TIMER_1_REG) using the :cpp:func:`ulp_set_wakeup_period` function.\\n\\nOnce the timer counts the number of ticks set in the ``RTC_CNTL_ULP_CP_TIMER_1_REG`` register, the ULP RISC-V coprocessor will power up and start running the program from the entry point set in the call to :cpp:func:`ulp_riscv_run`.\\n\\nThe program runs until the field ``RTC_CNTL_COCPU_DONE`` in register ``RTC_CNTL_COCPU_CTRL_REG`` gets written or when a trap occurs due to illegal processor state. Once the program halts, the ULP RISC-V coprocessor will power down, and the timer will be started again.\\n\\nTo disable the timer (effectively preventing the ULP program from running again), please clear the ``RTC_CNTL_ULP_CP_SLP_TIMER_EN`` bit in the ``RTC_CNTL_ULP_CP_TIMER_REG`` register. This can be done both from the ULP code and from the main program.\\n\\nULP RISC-V Peripheral Support\\n------------------------------\\n\\nTo enhance the capabilities of the ULP RISC-V coprocessor, it has access to peripherals which operate in the low-power (RTC) domain. The ULP RISC-V coprocessor can interact with these peripherals when the main CPU is in sleep mode, and can wake up the main CPU once a wakeup condition is reached. The following peripherals are supported.\\n\\nRTC I2C\\n^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe RTC I2C controller provides I2C master functionality in the RTC domain. The ULP RISC-V coprocessor can read from or write to I2C slave devices using this controller. To use the RTC I2C peripheral, call the :cpp:func:`ulp_riscv_i2c_master_init` from your application running on the main core before initializing the ULP RISC-V core and going to sleep.\\n\\nOnce the RTC I2C controller is initialized, the I2C slave device address must be programmed via the :cpp:func:`ulp_riscv_i2c_master_set_slave_addr` API before any read or write operation is performed.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The RTC I2C peripheral always expects a slave sub-register address to be programmed via the :cpp:func:`ulp_riscv_i2c_master_set_slave_reg_addr` API. If it is not, the I2C peripheral uses the ``SENS_SAR_I2C_CTRL_REG[18:11]`` as the sub-register address for the subsequent read or write operations. This could make the RTC I2C peripheral incompatible with certain I2C devices or sensors which do not need any sub-register to be programmed.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    There is no hardware atomicity protection in accessing the RTC I2C peripheral between the main CPU and the ULP RISC-V core. Therefore, care must be taken that both cores are not accessing the peripheral simultaneously.\\n\\nIn case your RTC I2C based ULP RISC-V program is not working as expected, the following sanity checks can help in debugging the issue:\\n\\n * Incorrect SDA/SCL pin selection: The SDA pin can only be set up as GPIO1 or GPIO3 and SCL pin can only be set up as GPIO0 or GPIO2. Make sure that the pin configuration is correct.\\n\\n * Incorrect I2C timing parameters: The RTC I2C bus timing configuration is limited by the I2C standard bus specification. Any timing parameters which violate the standard I2C bus specifications would result in an error. For details on the timing parameters, please read the `standard I2C bus specifications <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C>`_.\\n\\n * If the I2C slave device or sensor does not require a sub-register address to be programmed, it may not be compatible with the RTC I2C peripheral. Please refer the notes above.\\n\\n * If the RTC driver reports a ``Write Failed!`` or ``Read Failed!`` error log when running on the main CPU, then make sure:\\n\\n        * The I2C slave device or sensor works correctly with the standard I2C master on Espressif SoCs. This would rule out any problems with the I2C slave device itself.\\n        * If the RTC I2C interrupt status log reports a ``TIMEOUT`` error or ``ACK`` error, it could typically mean that the I2C device did not respond to a ``START`` condition sent out by the RTC I2C controller. This could happen if the I2C slave device is not connected properly to the controller pins or if the I2C slave device is in a bad state. Make sure that the I2C slave device is in a good state and connected properly before continuing.\\n        * If the RTC I2C interrupt log does not report any error status, it could mean that the driver is not fast enough in receiving data from the I2C slave device. This could happen as the RTC I2C controller does not have a TX/RX FIFO to store multiple bytes of data but rather, it depends on single byte transmissions using an interrupt status polling mechanism. This could be mitigated to some extent by making sure that the SCL clock of the peripheral is running as fast as possible. This can be tweaked by configuring the SCL low period and SCL high period values in the initialization config parameters for the peripheral.\\n\\n* Other methods of debugging problems would be to ensure that the RTC I2C controller is operational **only** on the main CPU **without** any ULP RISC-V code interfering and **without** any sleep mode being activated. This is the basic configuration under which the RTC I2C peripheral must work. This way you can rule out any potential issues due to the ULP or sleep modes.\\n\\nULP RISC-V Interrupt Handling\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThe ULP RISC-V core supports interrupt handling from certain internal and external events. By design, the ULP RISC-V core can handle interrupts from the following sources:\\n\\n.. list-table:: ULP RISC-V interrupt sources\\n    :widths: 10 5 5\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Interrupt Source\\n      - Type\\n      - IRQ\\n    * - Internal Timer Interrupt\\n      - Internal\\n      - 0\\n    * - EBREAK or ECALL or Illegal Instruction\\n      - Internal\\n      - 1\\n    * - Unaligned Memory Access\\n      - Internal\\n      - 2\\n    * - RTC Peripheral Sources\\n      - External\\n      - 31\\n\\nInterrupt handling is enabled via special 32-bit registers Q0-Q3 and custom R-type instructions. For more information, see *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* > *ULP Coprocessor* > *ULP-RISC-V* > *ULP-RISC-V Interrupts* [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}>`__].\\n\\nAll interrupts are enabled globally during start-up. When an interrupt occurs, the processor jumps to the IRQ vector. The IRQ vector performs the task of saving the register context and then calling the global interrupt dispatcher. The ULP RISC-V driver implements a *weak* interrupt dispatcher :cpp:func:`_ulp_riscv_interrupt_handler` which serves as the central point for handling all interrupts. This global dispatcher calls respective interrupt handlers which have been allocated via the :cpp:func:`ulp_riscv_intr_alloc`.\\n\\nInterrupt handling on the ULP RISC-V is not fully featured yet. At present, interrupt handling for internal interrupt sources is not supported. Support is provided for two RTC peripheral sources, viz., software-triggered interrupts and RTC IO-triggered interrupts. ULP RISC-V does not support nested interrupts. If users need custom interrupt handling then they may override the default global interrupt dispatcher by defining their own :cpp:func:`_ulp_riscv_interrupt_handler`.\\n\\nDebugging Your ULP RISC-V Program\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nWhen programming the ULP RISC-V, it can sometimes be challenging to figure out why the program is not behaving as expected. Due to the simplicity of the core, many of the standard methods of debugging, e.g., JTAG or ``printf``, are simply not available.\\n\\nKeeping this in mind, here are some ways that may help you debug your ULP RISC-V program:\\n\\n * Share program state through shared variables: as described in :ref:`ulp-riscv-access-variables`, both the main CPU and the ULP core can easily access global variables in RTC memory. Writing state information to such a variable from the ULP and reading it from the main CPU can help you discern what is happening on the ULP core. The downside of this approach is that it requires the main CPU to be awake, which will not always be the case. Keeping the main CPU awake might even, in some cases, mask problems, as some issues may only occur when certain power domains are powered down.\\n\\n * Use the bit-banged UART driver to print: the ULP RISC-V component comes with a low-speed bit-banged UART TX driver that can be used for printing information independently of the main CPU state. See :example:`system/ulp/ulp_riscv/uart_print` for an example of how to use this driver.\\n\\n * Trap signal: the ULP RISC-V has a hardware trap that will trigger under certain conditions, e.g., illegal instruction. This will cause the main CPU to be woken up with the wake-up cause :cpp:enumerator:`ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_COCPU_TRAP_TRIG`.\\n\\nApplication Examples\\n--------------------\\n\\n* ULP RISC-V Coprocessor polls GPIO while main CPU is in deep sleep: :example:`system/ulp/ulp_riscv/gpio`.\\n* ULP RISC-V Coprocessor uses bit-banged UART driver to print: :example:`system/ulp/ulp_riscv/uart_print`.\\n* ULP RISC-V Coprocessor reads external temperature sensor while main CPU is in deep sleep: :example:`system/ulp/ulp_riscv/ds18b20_onewire`.\\n* ULP RISC-V Coprocessor reads external I2C temperature and humidity sensor (BMP180) while the main CPU is in Deep-sleep and wakes up the main CPU once a threshold is met: :example:`system/ulp/ulp_riscv/i2c`.\\n* ULP RISC-V Coprocessor handles software interrupt and RTC IO interrupt: :example:`system/ulp/ulp_riscv/interrupts`.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/ulp_riscv.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/ulp_riscv_lock_shared.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/ulp_riscv_lock.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/ulp_riscv_i2c.inc\\n',\n",

This is because the default ESP-IDF bootloader implementation calls :cpp:func:`bootloader_random_enable` when the bootloader starts, and :cpp:func:`bootloader_random_disable` before executing the application.\\n\\nWhen any of these conditions are true, samples of physical noise are continuously mixed into the internal hardware RNG state to provide entropy. Consult the **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **Random Number Generator (RNG)** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#rng>`__] chapter for more details.\\n\\nIf none of the above conditions are true, the output of the RNG should be considered as pseudo-random only.\\n\\nStartup\\n-------\\n\\nDuring startup, ESP-IDF bootloader temporarily enables a non-RF entropy source (internal reference voltage noise) that provides entropy for any first boot key generation. However, after the application starts executing, then normally only pseudo-random numbers are available until {IDF_TARGET_RF_NAME} {IDF_TARGET_RF_IS} initialized.\\n\\nTo re-enable the entropy source temporarily during application startup, or for an application that does not use {IDF_TARGET_RF_NAME}, call the function :cpp:func:`bootloader_random_enable` to re-enable the internal entropy source. The function :cpp:func:`bootloader_random_disable` must be called to disable the entropy source again before using ADC, {IDF_TARGET_BOOTLOADER_RANDOM_INCOMPATIBLE} {IDF_TARGET_RF_NAME}.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The entropy source enabled during the boot process by the ESP-IDF Second Stage Bootloader seeds the internal RNG state with some entropy. However, the internal hardware RNG state is not large enough to provide a continuous stream of true random numbers. This is why a continuous entropy source must be enabled whenever true random numbers are required.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    If an application requires a source of true random numbers but cannot permanently enable a hardware entropy source, consider using a strong software DRBG implementation such as the mbedTLS CTR-DRBG or HMAC-DRBG, with an initial seed of entropy from hardware RNG true random numbers.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n    Secondary Entropy\\n    -----------------\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} RNG contains a secondary entropy source, based on sampling an asynchronous 8 MHz internal oscillator (see the Technical Reference Manual for details).

In testing, this secondary entropy source was sufficient to pass the `Dieharder`_ random number test suite without the main entropy source enabled (test input was created by concatenating short samples from continuously resetting {IDF_TARGET_NAME}).

       " 'Console\\n=======\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nESP-IDF provides ``console`` component, which includes building blocks needed to develop an interactive console over serial port. This component includes the following features:\\n\\n- Line editing, provided by `linenoise`_ library. This includes handling of backspace and arrow keys, scrolling through command history, command auto-completion, and argument hints.\\n- Splitting of command line into arguments.\\n- Argument parsing, provided by `argtable3`_ library. This library includes APIs used for parsing GNU style command line arguments.\\n- Functions for registration and dispatching of commands.\\n- Functions to establish a basic REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) environment.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  These features can be used together or independently. For example, it is possible to use line editing and command registration features, but use ``getopt`` or custom code for argument parsing, instead of `argtable3`_. Likewise, it is possible to use simpler means of command input (such as ``fgets``) together with the rest of the means for command splitting and argument parsing.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  When using a console application on a chip that supports a hardware USB serial interface, we suggest to disable the secondary serial console output. The secondary output will be output-only and consequently does not make sense in an interactive application.\\n\\nLine Editing\\n------------\\n\\nLine editing feature lets users compose commands by typing them, erasing symbols using the ``backspace`` key, navigating within the command using the left/right keys, navigating to previously typed commands using the up/down keys, and performing autocompletion using the ``tab`` key.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  This feature relies on ANSI escape sequence support in the terminal application. As such, serial monitors which display raw UART data can not be used together with the line editing library. If you see ``[6n`` or similar escape sequence when running :example:`system/console` example instead of a command prompt (e.g., ``esp>`` ), it means that the serial monitor does not support escape sequences. Programs which are known to work are GNU screen, minicom, and esp-idf-monitor (which can be invoked using ``idf.py monitor`` from project directory).\\n\\nHere is an overview of functions provided by `linenoise <https://github.com/antirez/linenoise>`_ library.\\n\\nConfiguration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nLinenoise library does not need explicit initialization. However, some configuration defaults may need to be changed before invoking the main line editing function.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`linenoiseClearScreen`\\n\\n  Clear terminal screen using an escape sequence and position the cursor at the top left corner.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`linenoiseSetMultiLine`\\n\\n  Switch between single line and multi line editing modes. In single line mode, if the length of the command exceeds the width of the terminal, the command text is scrolled within the line to show the end of the text. In this case the beginning of the text is hidden. Single line mode needs less data to be sent to refresh screen on each key press, so exhibits less glitching compared to the multi line mode. On the flip side, editing commands and copying command text from terminal in single line mode is harder. Default is single line mode.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`linenoiseAllowEmpty`\\n\\n  Set whether linenoise library returns a zero-length string (if ``true``) or ``NULL`` (if ``false``) for empty lines. By default, zero-length strings are returned.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`linenoiseSetMaxLineLen`\\n\\n  Set maximum length of the line for linenoise library. Default length is 4096 bytes. The default value can be updated to optimize RAM memory usage.\\n\\n\\nMain Loop\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`linenoise`\\n\\n  In most cases, console applications have some form of read/eval loop. :cpp:func:`linenoise` is the single function which handles user\\'s key presses and returns the completed line once the ``enter`` key is pressed. As such, it handles the ``read`` part of the loop.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`linenoiseFree`\\n\\n  This function must be called to release the command line buffer obtained from :cpp:func:`linenoise` function.\\n\\n\\nHints and Completions\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`linenoiseSetCompletionCallback`\\n\\n  When the user presses the ``tab`` key, linenoise library invokes the completion callback. The callback should inspect the contents of the command typed so far and provide a list of possible completions using calls to :cpp:func:`linenoiseAddCompletion` function. :cpp:func:`linenoiseSetCompletionCallback` function should be called to register this completion callback, if completion feature is desired.\\n\\n  ``console`` component provides a ready made function to provide completions for registered commands, :cpp:func:`esp_console_get_completion` (see below).\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`linenoiseAddCompletion`\\n\\n  Function to be called by completion callback to inform the library about possible completions of the currently typed command.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`linenoiseSetHintsCallback`\\n\\n  Whenever user input changes, linenoise invokes the hints callback. This callback can inspect the command line typed so far, and provide a string with hints (which can include list of command arguments, for example). The library then displays the hint text on the same line where editing happens, possibly with a different color.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`linenoiseSetFreeHintsCallback`\\n\\n  If the hint string returned by hints callback is dynamically allocated or needs to be otherwise recycled, the function which performs such cleanup should be registered via :cpp:func:`linenoiseSetFreeHintsCallback`.\\n\\n\\nHistory\\n^^^^^^^\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`linenoiseHistorySetMaxLen`\\n\\n  This function sets the number of most recently typed commands to be kept in memory. Users can navigate the history using the up/down arrows keys.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`linenoiseHistoryAdd`\\n\\n  Linenoise does not automatically add commands to history. Instead, applications need to call this function to add command strings to the history.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`linenoiseHistorySave`\\n\\n  Function saves command history from RAM to a text file, for example on an SD card or on a filesystem in flash memory.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`linenoiseHistoryLoad`\\n\\n  Counterpart to :cpp:func:`linenoiseHistorySave`, loads history from a file.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`linenoiseHistoryFree`\\n\\n  Releases memory used to store command history. Call this function when done working with linenoise library.\\n\\n\\nSplitting of Command Line into Arguments\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n``console`` component provides :cpp:func:`esp_console_split_argv` function to split command line string into arguments. The function returns the number of arguments found (``argc``) and fills an array of pointers which can be passed as ``argv`` argument to any function which accepts arguments in ``argc, argv`` format.\\n\\nThe command line is split into arguments according to the following rules:\\n\\n- Arguments are separated by spaces\\n- If spaces within arguments are required, they can be escaped using ``\\\\`` (backslash) character.\\n- Other escape sequences which are recognized are ``\\\\\\\\`` (which produces literal backslash) and ``\\\\\"``, which produces a double quote.\\n- Arguments can be quoted using double quotes. Quotes may appear only in the beginning and at the end of the argument. Quotes within the argument must be escaped as mentioned above. Quotes surrounding the argument are stripped by ``esp_console_split_argv`` function.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\\n- ``abc def 1 20 .3`` > [ ``abc``, ``def``, ``1``, ``20``, ``.3`` ]\\n- ``abc \"123 456\" def`` > [ ``abc``, ``123 456``, ``def`` ]\\n- ```a\\\\ b\\\\\\\\c\\\\\"`` > [ ``a b\\\\c\"`` ]\\n\\n\\nArgument Parsing\\n----------------\\n\\nFor argument parsing, ``console`` component includes `argtable3 <https://www.argtable.org/>`_ library. Please see `tutorial <https://www.argtable.org/tutorial/>`_ for an introduction to `argtable3 <https://www.argtable.org/>`_. Github repository also includes `examples <https://github.com/argtable/argtable3/tree/master/examples>`_.\\n\\n\\nCommand Registration and Dispatching\\n------------------------------------\\n\\n``console`` component includes utility functions which handle registration of commands, matching commands typed by the user to registered ones, and calling these commands with the arguments given on the command line.\\n\\nApplication first initializes command registration module using a call to :cpp:func:`esp_console_init`, and calls :cpp:func:`esp_console_cmd_register` function to register command handlers.\\n\\nFor each command, application provides the following information (in the form of ``esp_console_cmd_t`` structure):\\n\\n- Command name (string without spaces)\\n- Help text explaining what the command does\\n- Optional hint text listing the arguments of the command. If application uses Argtable3 for argument parsing, hint text can be generated automatically by providing a pointer to argtable argument definitions structure instead.\\n- Command handler function (without context), or\\n- Command handler function (with context). If this function is given, an additional call to :cpp:func:`esp_console_cmd_set_context` must follow *before* the command may be called to initialize the context.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  You can either use a command handler function which takes a context or a command handler function which does not take a context, not both. If you use the command handler function which takes a context, you MUST call :cpp:func:`esp_console_cmd_set_context` to initialize its context, otherwise the function may access the uninitialized context.\\n\\nA few other functions are provided by the command registration module:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_console_run`\\n\\n  This function takes the command line string, splits it into argc/argv argument list using :cpp:func:`esp_console_split_argv`, looks up the command in the list of registered components, and if it is found, executes its handler.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_console_register_help_command`\\n\\n  Adds ``help`` command to the list of registered commands. This command prints the list of all the registered commands, along with their arguments and help texts.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_console_get_completion`\\n\\n  Callback function to be used with :cpp:func:`linenoiseSetCompletionCallback` from linenoise library. Provides completions to linenoise based on the list of registered commands.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_console_get_hint`\\n\\n  Callback function to be used with :cpp:func:`linenoiseSetHintsCallback` from linenoise library. Provides argument hints for registered commands to linenoise.\\n\\n\\nInitialize Console REPL Environment\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nTo establish a basic REPL environment, ``console`` component provides several useful APIs, combining those functions described above.\\n\\nIn a typical application, you only need to call :cpp:func:`esp_console_new_repl_uart` to initialize the REPL environment based on UART device, including driver install, basic console configuration, spawning a thread to do REPL task and register several useful commands (e.g., `help`).\\n\\nAfter that, you can register your own commands with :cpp:func:`esp_console_cmd_register`. The REPL environment keeps in init state until you call :cpp:func:`esp_console_start_repl`.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_USB_SERIAL_JTAG_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Likewise, if your REPL environment is based on USB_SERIAL_JTAG device, you only need to call :cpp:func:`esp_console_new_repl_usb_serial_jtag` at first step. Then call other functions as usual.\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\nExample application illustrating usage of the ``console`` component is available in :example:`system/console` directory. This example shows how to initialize UART and VFS functions, set up linenoise library, read and handle commands from UART, and store command history in Flash. See README.md in the example directory for more details.\\n\\nBesides that, ESP-IDF contains several useful examples which are based on the ``console`` component and can be treated as \"tools\" when developing applications. For example, :example:`peripherals/i2c/i2c_tools`, :example:`wifi/iperf`.\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_console.inc\\n',\n",

       " 'POSIX Threads Support\\n=====================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nESP-IDF is based on FreeRTOS but offers a range of POSIX-compatible APIs that allow easy porting of third-party code. This includes support for common parts of the POSIX Threads ``pthread`` API.\\n\\nPOSIX Threads are implemented in ESP-IDF as wrappers around equivalent FreeRTOS features. The runtime memory or performance overhead of using the pthreads API is quite low, but not every feature available in either pthreads or FreeRTOS is available via the ESP-IDF pthreads support.\\n\\nPthreads can be used in ESP-IDF by including standard ``pthread.h`` header, which is included in the toolchain libc. An additional ESP-IDF specific header, ``esp_pthread.h``, provides additional non-POSIX APIs for using some ESP-IDF features with pthreads.\\n\\nC++ Standard Library implementations for ``std::thread``, ``std::mutex``, ``std::condition_variable``, etc., are realized using pthreads (via GCC libstdc++). Therefore, restrictions mentioned here also apply to the equivalent C++ standard library functionality.\\n\\nRTOS Integration\\n----------------\\n\\nUnlike many operating systems using POSIX Threads, ESP-IDF is a real-time operating system with a real-time scheduler. This means that a thread will only stop running if a higher priority task is ready to run, the thread blocks on an OS synchronization structure like a mutex, or the thread calls any of the functions ``sleep``, :cpp:func:`vTaskDelay`, or ``usleep``.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    When calling a standard libc or C++ sleep function, such as ``usleep`` defined in ``unistd.h``, the task will only block and yield the core if the sleep time is longer than :ref:`one FreeRTOS tick period <CONFIG_FREERTOS_HZ>`. If the time is shorter, the thread will busy-wait instead of yielding to another RTOS task.\\n\\nBy default, all POSIX Threads have the same RTOS priority, but it is possible to change this by calling a :ref:`custom API <esp-pthread>`.\\n\\nStandard Features\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe following standard APIs are implemented in ESP-IDF.\\n\\nRefer to `standard POSIX Threads documentation <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pthreads.7.html>`__, or ``pthread.h``, for details about the standard arguments and behaviour of each function. Differences or limitations compared to the standard APIs are noted below.\\n\\n.. _posix_thread_api:\\n\\nThread APIs\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n* ``pthread_create()``\\n    - The ``attr`` argument is supported for setting stack size and detach state only. Other attribute fields are ignored.\\n    - Unlike FreeRTOS task functions, the ``start_routine`` function is allowed to return. A detached type thread is automatically deleted if the function returns. The default joinable type thread will be suspended until ``pthread_join()`` is called on it.\\n* ``pthread_join()``\\n* ``pthread_detach()``\\n* ``pthread_exit()``\\n* ``sched_yield()``\\n* ``pthread_self()``\\n    - An assert will fail if this function is called from a FreeRTOS task which is not a pthread.\\n* ``pthread_equal()``\\n\\nThread Attributes\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n* ``pthread_attr_init()``\\n* ``pthread_attr_destroy()``\\n    - This function does not need to free any resources and instead resets the ``attr`` structure to defaults. The implementation is the same as ``pthread_attr_init()``.\\n* ``pthread_attr_getstacksize()`` / ``pthread_attr_setstacksize()``\\n* ``pthread_attr_getdetachstate()`` / ``pthread_attr_setdetachstate()``\\n\\nOnce\\n^^^^\\n\\n* ``pthread_once()``\\n\\nStatic initializer constant ``PTHREAD_ONCE_INIT`` is supported.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    This function can be called from tasks created using either pthread or FreeRTOS APIs.\\n\\nMutexes\\n^^^^^^^\\n\\nPOSIX Mutexes are implemented as FreeRTOS Mutex Semaphores (normal type for \"fast\" or \"error check\" mutexes, and Recursive type for \"recursive\" mutexes). This means that they have the same priority inheritance behavior as mutexes created with :cpp:func:`xSemaphoreCreateMutex`.\\n\\n* ``pthread_mutex_init()``\\n* ``pthread_mutex_destroy()``\\n* ``pthread_mutex_lock()``\\n* ``pthread_mutex_timedlock()``\\n* ``pthread_mutex_trylock()``\\n* ``pthread_mutex_unlock()``\\n* ``pthread_mutexattr_init()``\\n* ``pthread_mutexattr_destroy()``\\n* ``pthread_mutexattr_gettype()`` / ``pthread_mutexattr_settype()``\\n\\nStatic initializer constant ``PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER`` is supported, but the non-standard static initializer constants for other mutex types are not supported.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    These functions can be called from tasks created using either pthread or FreeRTOS APIs.\\n\\nCondition Variables\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n* ``pthread_cond_init()``\\n    - The ``attr`` argument is not implemented and is ignored.\\n* ``pthread_cond_destroy()``\\n* ``pthread_cond_signal()``\\n* ``pthread_cond_broadcast()``\\n* ``pthread_cond_wait()``\\n* ``pthread_cond_timedwait()``\\n\\nStatic initializer constant ``PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER`` is supported.\\n\\n* The resolution of ``pthread_cond_timedwait()`` timeouts is the RTOS tick period (see :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_HZ`). Timeouts may be delayed up to one tick period after the requested timeout.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    These functions can be called from tasks created using either pthread or FreeRTOS APIs.\\n\\nSemaphores\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn ESP-IDF, POSIX **unnamed** semaphores are implemented. The accessible API is described below. It implements `semaphores as specified in the POSIX standard <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/semaphore.h.html>`_, unless specified otherwise.\\n\\n* `sem_init() <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/sem_init.html>`_\\n* `sem_destroy() <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/sem_destroy.html>`_\\n\\n    - ``pshared`` is ignored. Semaphores can always be shared between FreeRTOS tasks.\\n\\n* `sem_post() <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/sem_post.html>`_\\n\\n    - If the semaphore has a value of ``SEM_VALUE_MAX`` already, ``-1`` is returned and ``errno`` is set to ``EAGAIN``.\\n\\n* `sem_wait() <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/sem_wait.html>`_\\n* `sem_trywait() <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/sem_trywait.html>`_\\n* `sem_timedwait() <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/sem_timedwait.html>`_\\n\\n    - The time value passed by abstime will be rounded up to the next FreeRTOS tick.\\n    - The actual timeout happens after the tick that the time was rounded to and before the following tick.\\n    - It is possible, though unlikely, that the task is preempted directly after the timeout calculation, delaying the timeout of the following blocking operating system call by the duration of the preemption.\\n\\n* `sem_getvalue() <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/sem_getvalue.html>`_\\n\\nRead/Write Locks\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe following API functions of the POSIX reader-writer locks specification are implemented:\\n\\n* `pthread_rwlock_init() <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_rwlock_init.html>`_\\n\\n    - The ``attr`` argument is not implemented and is ignored.\\n\\n* `pthread_rwlock_destroy() <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_rwlock_destroy.html>`_\\n* `pthread_rwlock_rdlock() <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_rwlock_rdlock.html>`_\\n* `pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock() <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock.html>`_\\n* `pthread_rwlock_wrlock() <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_rwlock_wrlock.html>`_\\n* `pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_rwlock_trywrlock.html>`_\\n* `pthread_rwlock_unlock() <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_rwlock_unlock.html>`_\\n\\nThe static initializer constant ``PTHREAD_RWLOCK_INITIALIZER`` is supported.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    These functions can be called from tasks created using either pthread or FreeRTOS APIs.\\n\\nThread-Specific Data\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n* ``pthread_key_create()``\\n    - The ``destr_function`` argument is supported and will be called if a thread function exits normally, calls ``pthread_exit()``, or if the underlying task is deleted directly using the FreeRTOS function :cpp:func:`vTaskDelete`.\\n* ``pthread_key_delete()``\\n* ``pthread_setspecific()`` / ``pthread_getspecific()``\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    These functions can be called from tasks created using either pthread or FreeRTOS APIs. When calling these functions from tasks created using FreeRTOS APIs, :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_TLSP_DELETION_CALLBACKS` config option must be enabled to ensure the thread-specific data is cleaned up before the task is deleted.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    There are other options for thread local storage in ESP-IDF, including options with higher performance. See :doc:`/api-guides/thread-local-storage`.\\n\\nNot Implemented\\n---------------\\n\\nThe ``pthread.h`` header is a standard header and includes additional APIs and features which are not implemented in ESP-IDF. These include:\\n\\n* ``pthread_cancel()`` returns ``ENOSYS`` if called.\\n* ``pthread_condattr_init()`` returns ``ENOSYS`` if called.\\n\\nOther POSIX Threads functions (not listed here) are not implemented and will produce either a compiler or a linker error if referenced from an ESP-IDF application. If you identify a useful API that you would like to see implemented in ESP-IDF, please open a `feature request on GitHub <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues>`_ with the details.\\n\\n.. _esp-pthread:\\n\\nESP-IDF Extensions\\n------------------\\n\\nThe API :cpp:func:`esp_pthread_set_cfg` defined in the ``esp_pthreads.h`` header offers custom extensions to control how subsequent calls to ``pthread_create()`` behaves. Currently, the following configuration can be set:\\n\\n.. list::\\n    - Default stack size of new threads, if not specified when calling ``pthread_create()`` (overrides :ref:`CONFIG_PTHREAD_TASK_STACK_SIZE_DEFAULT`).\\n    - Stack memory capabilities determine which kind of memory is used for allocating pthread stacks. The field takes ESP-IDF heap capability flags, as defined in :component_file:`heap/include/esp_heap_caps.h`. The memory must be 8-bit accessible (MALLOC_CAP_8BIT), besides other custom flags the user can choose from. The user is responsible for ensuring the correctness of the stack memory capabilities. For more information about memory locations, refer to the documentation of :ref:`memory_capabilities`.\\n    - RTOS priority of new threads (overrides :ref:`CONFIG_PTHREAD_TASK_PRIO_DEFAULT`).\\n    :SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES: - Core affinity / core pinning of new threads (overrides :ref:`CONFIG_PTHREAD_TASK_CORE_DEFAULT`).\\n    - FreeRTOS task name for new threads (overrides :ref:`CONFIG_PTHREAD_TASK_NAME_DEFAULT`)\\n\\nThis configuration is scoped to the calling thread (or FreeRTOS task), meaning that :cpp:func:`esp_pthread_set_cfg` can be called independently in different threads or tasks. If the ``inherit_cfg`` flag is set in the current configuration then any new thread created will inherit the creator\\'s configuration (if that thread calls ``pthread_create()`` recursively), otherwise the new thread will have the default configuration.\\n\\nExamples\\n--------\\n\\n- :example:`system/pthread` demonstrates using the pthreads API to create threads.\\n- :example:`cxx/pthread` demonstrates using C++ Standard Library functions with threads.\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_pthread.inc\\n',\n",
       " 'ULP LP-Core Coprocessor Programming\\n===================================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThe ULP LP-Core (Low-power core) coprocessor is a variant of the ULP present in {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. It features ultra-low power consumption while also being able to stay powered on while the main CPU stays in low-power modes. This enables the LP-Core coprocessor to handle tasks like GPIO or sensor readings while the main CPU is in sleep mode, resulting in significant overall power savings for the entire system.\\n\\nThe ULP LP-Core coprocessor has the following features:\\n\\n* Utilizes a 32-bit processor based on the RISC-V ISA, encompassing the standard extensions integer (I), multiplication/division (M), atomic (A), and compressed (C).\\n* Interrupt controller.\\n* Includes a debug module that supports external debugging via JTAG.\\n* Can access all of the High-power (HP) SRAM and peripherals when the entire system is active.\\n* Can access the Low-power (LP) SRAM and peripherals when the HP system is in sleep mode.\\n\\nCompiling Code for the ULP LP-Core\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nThe ULP LP-Core code is compiled together with your ESP-IDF project as a separate binary and automatically embedded into the main project binary. To acheive this do the following:\\n\\n1. Place the ULP LP-Core code, written in C or assembly (with the ``.S`` extension), in a dedicated directory within the component directory, such as ``ulp/``.\\n\\n2. After registering the component in the CMakeLists.txt file, call the ``ulp_embed_binary`` function. Here is an example:\\n\\n    idf_component_register()\\n\\n    set(ulp_app_name ulp_${COMPONENT_NAME})\\n    set(ulp_sources \"ulp/ulp_c_source_file.c\" \"ulp/ulp_assembly_source_file.S\")\\n    set(ulp_exp_dep_srcs \"ulp_c_source_file.c\")\\n\\n    ulp_embed_binary(${ulp_app_name} \"${ulp_sources}\" \"${ulp_exp_dep_srcs}\")\\n\\nThe first argument to ``ulp_embed_binary`` specifies the ULP binary name. The name specified here is also used by other generated artifacts such as the ELF file, map file, header file, and linker export file. The second argument specifies the ULP source files. Finally, the third argument specifies the list of component source files which include the header file to be generated. This list is needed to build the dependencies correctly and ensure that the generated header file is created before any of these files are compiled. See the section below for the concept of generated header files for ULP applications.\\n\\n1. Enable both :ref:`CONFIG_ULP_COPROC_ENABLED` and :ref:`CONFIG_ULP_COPROC_TYPE` in menucofig, and set :ref:`CONFIG_ULP_COPROC_TYPE` to ``CONFIG_ULP_COPROC_TYPE_LP_CORE``. The :ref:`CONFIG_ULP_COPROC_RESERVE_MEM` option reserves RTC memory for the ULP, and must be set to a value big enough to store both the ULP LP-Core code and data. If the application components contain multiple ULP programs, then the size of the RTC memory must be sufficient to hold the largest one.\\n\\n2. Build the application as usual (e.g., ``idf.py app``).\\n\\nDuring the build process, the following steps are taken to build ULP program:\\n\\n    1. **Run each source file through the C compiler and assembler.** This step generates the object files ``.obj.c`` or ``.obj.S`` in the component build directory depending on the source file processed.\\n\\n    2. **Run the linker script template through the C preprocessor.** The template is located in ``components/ulp/ld`` directory.\\n\\n    3. **Link the object files into an output ELF file** (``ulp_app_name.elf``). The Map file ``ulp_app_name.map`` generated at this stage may be useful for debugging purposes.\\n\\n    4. **Dump the contents of the ELF file into a binary** (``ulp_app_name.bin``) which can then be embedded into the application.\\n\\n    5. **Generate a list of global symbols** (``ulp_app_name.sym``) in the ELF file using ``riscv32-esp-elf-nm``.\\n\\n    6. **Create an LD export script and a header file** ``ulp_app_name.ld`` and ``ulp_app_name.h`` containing the symbols from ``ulp_app_name.sym``. This is done using the ``esp32ulp_mapgen.py`` utility.\\n\\n    7. **Add the generated binary to the list of binary files** to be embedded into the application.\\n\\n.. _ulp-lp-core-access-variables:\\n\\nAccessing the ULP LP-Core Program Variables\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nGlobal symbols defined in the ULP LP-Core program may be used inside the main program.\\n\\nFor example, the ULP LP-Core program may define a variable ``measurement_count`` which defines the number of GPIO measurements the program needs to make before waking up the chip from deep sleep.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    volatile int measurement_count;\\n\\n    int some_function()\\n    {\\n        //read the measurement count for later use.\\n        int temp = measurement_count;\\n\\n        ...do something.\\n    }\\n\\nThe main program can access the global ULP LP-Core program variables as the build system makes this possible by generating the ``${ULP_APP_NAME}.h`` and ``${ULP_APP_NAME}.ld`` files which define the global symbols present in the ULP LP-Core program. Each global symbol defined in the ULP LP-Core program is included in these files and are prefixed with ``ulp_``.\\n\\nThe header file contains the declaration of the symbol:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    extern uint32_t ulp_measurement_count;\\n\\nNote that all symbols (variables, arrays, functions) are declared as ``uint32_t``. For functions and arrays, take the address of the symbol and cast it to the appropriate type.\\n\\nThe generated linker script file defines the locations of symbols in LP_MEM::\\n\\n    PROVIDE ( ulp_measurement_count = 0x50000060 );\\n\\nTo access the ULP LP-Core program variables from the main program, the generated header file should be included using an ``include`` statement. This allows the ULP LP-Core program variables to be accessed as regular variables.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    #include \"ulp_app_name.h\"\\n\\n    void init_ulp_vars() {\\n        ulp_measurement_count = 64;\\n    }\\n\\n\\nStarting the ULP LP-Core Program\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nTo run a ULP LP-Core program, the main application needs to load the ULP program into RTC memory using the :cpp:func:`ulp_lp_core_load_binary` function, and then start it using the :cpp:func:`ulp_lp_core_run` function.\\n\\nEach ULP LP-Core program is embedded into the ESP-IDF application as a binary blob. The application can reference this blob and load it in the following way (supposed ULP_APP_NAME was defined to ``ulp_app_name``):\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    extern const uint8_t bin_start[] asm(\"_binary_ulp_app_name_bin_start\");\\n    extern const uint8_t bin_end[]   asm(\"_binary_ulp_app_name_bin_end\");\\n\\n    void start_ulp_program() {\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK( ulp_lp_core_load_binary( bin_start,\\n            (bin_end - bin_start)) );\\n    }\\n\\nOnce the program is loaded into LP memory, the application can be configured and started by calling :cpp:func:`ulp_lp_core_run`:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    ulp_lp_core_cfg_t cfg = {\\n        .wakeup_source = ULP_LP_CORE_WAKEUP_SOURCE_LP_TIMER, // LP core will be woken up periodically by LP timer\\n        .lp_timer_sleep_duration_us = 10000,\\n    };\\n\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK( ulp_lp_core_run(&cfg) );\\n\\nULP LP-Core Program Flow\\n------------------------\\n\\nHow the ULP LP-Core coprocessor is started depends on the wakeup source selected in :cpp:type:`ulp_lp_core_cfg_t`. The most common use-case is for the ULP to periodically wake-up, do some measurements before either waking up the main CPU or going back to sleep again.\\n\\nThe ULP has the following wake-up sources:\\n    * :c:macro:`ULP_LP_CORE_WAKEUP_SOURCE_HP_CPU` - LP Core can be woken up by the HP CPU.\\n    * :c:macro:`ULP_LP_CORE_WAKEUP_SOURCE_LP_TIMER` - LP Core can be woken up by the LP timer.\\n    * :c:macro:`ULP_LP_CORE_WAKEUP_SOURCE_ETM` - LP Core can be woken up by a ETM event. (Not yet supported)\\n    * :c:macro:`ULP_LP_CORE_WAKEUP_SOURCE_LP_IO` - LP Core can be woken up when LP IO level changes. (Not yet supported)\\n    * :c:macro:`ULP_LP_CORE_WAKEUP_SOURCE_LP_UART` - LP Core can be woken up after receiving a certain number of UART RX pulses. (Not yet supported)\\n\\nWhen the ULP is woken up, it will go through the following steps:\\n\\n1. Initialize system feature, e.g., interrupts\\n2. Call user code ``main()``\\n3. Return from ``main()``\\n4. If ``lp_timer_sleep_duration_us`` is specified, then configure the next wake-up alarm\\n5. Call :cpp:func:`ulp_lp_core_halt`\\n\\nULP LP-Core Peripheral Support\\n------------------------------\\n\\nTo enhance the capabilities of the ULP LP-Core coprocessor, it has access to peripherals which operate in the low-power domain. The ULP LP-Core coprocessor can interact with these peripherals when the main CPU is in sleep mode, and can wake up the main CPU once a wakeup condition is reached. The following peripherals are supported:\\n\\n * LP IO\\n * LP I2C\\n * LP UART\\n\\nApplication Examples\\n--------------------\\n\\n* :example:`system/ulp/lp_core/gpio` polls GPIO while main CPU is in deep sleep.\\n* :example:`system/ulp/lp_core/lp_i2c` reads external I2C ambient light sensor (BH1750) while the main CPU is in Deep-sleep and wakes up the main CPU once a threshold is met.\\n* :example:`system/ulp/lp_core/lp_uart/lp_uart_echo` reads data written to a serial console and echoes it back. This example demonstrates the usage of the LP UART driver running on the LP core.\\n* :example:`system/ulp/lp_core/lp_uart/lp_uart_print` shows how to print various statements from a program running on the LP core.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\nMain CPU API Reference\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/ulp_lp_core.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/lp_core_i2c.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/lp_core_uart.inc\\n\\nLP Core API Reference\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/ulp_lp_core_utils.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/ulp_lp_core_gpio.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/ulp_lp_core_i2c.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/ulp_lp_core_uart.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/ulp_lp_core_print.inc\\n',\n",

According to the features used by an application, there are some sub sleep modes. See :ref:`sleep_modes` for these sleep modes and sub sleep modes. Additionally, there are some power-down options that can be configured to further reduce the power consumption. See :ref:`power_down_options` for more details.\\n\\nThere are several wakeup sources in the sleep modes. These sources can also be combined so that the chip will wake up when any of the sources are triggered. :ref:`api-reference-wakeup-source` describes these wakeup sources and configuration APIs in detail.\\n\\nThe configuration of power-down options and wakeup sources are optional. They can be configured at any moment before entering the sleep modes.\\n\\nThen the application can call sleep start APIs to enter one of the sleep modes. See :ref:`enter_sleep` for more details. When the wakeup condition is met, the application is awoken from sleep. See :ref:`wakeup_cause` on how to get the wakeup cause, and :ref:`disable_sleep_wakeup_source` on how to handle the wakeup sources after wakeup.\\n\\n.. _sleep_modes:\\n\\nSleep Modes\\n-----------\\n\\nIn Light-sleep mode, the digital peripherals, most of the RAM, and CPUs are clock-gated and their supply voltage is reduced. Upon exit from Light-sleep, the digital peripherals, RAM, and CPUs resume operation and their internal states are preserved.\\n\\nIn Deep-sleep mode, the CPUs, most of the RAM, and all digital peripherals that are clocked from APB_CLK are powered off. The only parts of the chip that remain powered on are:\\n\\n    .. list::\\n\\n        - RTC controller\\n        :SOC_ULP_SUPPORTED: - ULP coprocessor\\n        :SOC_RTC_FAST_MEM_SUPPORTED: - RTC FAST memory\\n        :SOC_RTC_SLOW_MEM_SUPPORTED: - RTC SLOW memory\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_BT_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Wi-Fi/Bluetooth and Sleep Modes\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    In Deep-sleep and Light-sleep modes, the wireless peripherals are powered down. Before entering Deep-sleep or Light-sleep modes, the application must disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth using the appropriate calls (i.e., :cpp:func:`esp_bluedroid_disable`, :cpp:func:`esp_bt_controller_disable`, :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_stop`). Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections are not maintained in Deep-sleep or Light-sleep mode, even if these functions are not called.\\n\\n    If Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connections need to be maintained, enable Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Modem-sleep mode and automatic Light-sleep feature (see :doc:`Power Management APIs <power_management>`). This allows the system to wake up from sleep automatically when required by the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth driver, thereby maintaining the connection.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_BT_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Wi-Fi and Sleep Modes\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    In Deep-sleep and Light-sleep modes, the wireless peripherals are powered down. Before entering Deep-sleep or Light-sleep modes, applications must disable Wi-Fi using the appropriate calls (:cpp:func:`esp_wifi_stop`). Wi-Fi connections are not maintained in Deep-sleep or Light-sleep mode, even if these functions are not called.\\n\\n    If Wi-Fi connections need to be maintained, enable Wi-Fi Modem-sleep mode and automatic Light-sleep feature (see :doc:`Power Management APIs <power_management>`). This will allow the system to wake up from sleep automatically when required by the Wi-Fi driver, thereby maintaining a connection to the AP.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s2 or esp32s3 or esp32c2 or esp32c3\\n\\n    Sub Sleep Modes\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Tables below list the sub sleep modes in the first row and the features they support in the first column.

Wakeup sources are not disabled after wakeup, you can disable them using :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_disable_wakeup_source` API if you do not need them any more. See :ref:`disable_sleep_wakeup_source`.\\n\\nFollowing are the wakeup sources supported on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.\\n\\nTimer\\n^^^^^\\n\\nThe RTC controller has a built-in timer which can be used to wake up the chip after a predefined amount of time. Time is specified at microsecond precision, but the actual resolution depends on the clock source selected for RTC_SLOW_CLK.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_ULP_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    For details on RTC clock options, see **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **ULP Coprocessor** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#ulp>`__].\\n\\nRTC peripherals or RTC memories do not need to be powered on during sleep in this wakeup mode.\\n\\n:cpp:func:`esp_sleep_enable_timer_wakeup` function can be used to enable sleep wakeup using a timer.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_PM_SUPPORT_TOUCH_SENSOR_WAKEUP\\n\\n    Touchpad\\n    ^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The RTC IO module contains the logic to trigger wakeup when a touch sensor interrupt occurs. To wakeup from a touch sensor interrupt, users need to configure the touch pad interrupt before the chip enters Deep-sleep or Light-sleep modes.\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32\\n\\n        Revisions 0 and 1 of ESP32 only support this wakeup mode when RTC peripherals are not forced to be powered on (i.e., ESP_PD_DOMAIN_RTC_PERIPH should be set to ESP_PD_OPTION_AUTO).\\n\\n    :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_enable_touchpad_wakeup` function can be used to enable this wakeup source.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_PM_SUPPORT_EXT0_WAKEUP\\n\\n    External Wakeup (``ext0``)\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The RTC IO module contains the logic to trigger wakeup when one of RTC GPIOs is set to a predefined logic level. RTC IO is part of the RTC peripherals power domain, so RTC peripherals will be kept powered on during Deep-sleep if this wakeup source is requested.\\n\\n    The RTC IO module is enabled in this mode, so internal pullup or pulldown resistors can also be used. They need to be configured by the application using :cpp:func:`rtc_gpio_pullup_en` and :cpp:func:`rtc_gpio_pulldown_en` functions before calling :cpp:func:`esp_deep_sleep_start`.\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32\\n\\n        In revisions 0 and 1 of ESP32, this wakeup source is incompatible with ULP and touch wakeup sources.\\n\\n    :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_enable_ext0_wakeup` function can be used to enable this wakeup source.\\n\\n    .. warning::\\n\\n        After waking up from sleep, the IO pad used for wakeup will be configured as RTC IO. Therefore, before using this pad as digital GPIO, users need to reconfigure it using :cpp:func:`rtc_gpio_deinit` function.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_PM_SUPPORT_EXT1_WAKEUP\\n\\n    External Wakeup (``ext1``)\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The RTC controller contains the logic to trigger wakeup using multiple RTC GPIOs. One of the following two logic functions can be used to trigger ext1 wakeup:\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32\\n\\n        - wake up if any of the selected pins is high (``ESP_EXT1_WAKEUP_ANY_HIGH``)\\n        - wake up if all the selected pins are low (``ESP_EXT1_WAKEUP_ALL_LOW``)\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32s2 or esp32s3 or esp32c6 or esp32h2\\n\\n        - wake up if any of the selected pins is high (``ESP_EXT1_WAKEUP_ANY_HIGH``)\\n        - wake up if any of the selected pins is low (``ESP_EXT1_WAKEUP_ANY_LOW``)\\n\\n    This wakeup source is controlled by the RTC controller. Unlike ``ext0``, this wakeup source supports wakeup even when the RTC peripheral is powered down. Although the power domain of the RTC peripheral, where RTC IOs are located, is powered down during sleep modes, ESP-IDF will automatically lock the state of the wakeup pin before the system enters sleep modes and unlock upon exiting sleep modes. Therefore, the internal pull-up or pull-down resistors can still be configured for the wakeup pin::\\n\\n        esp_sleep_pd_config(ESP_PD_DOMAIN_RTC_PERIPH, ESP_PD_OPTION_ON);\\n        rtc_gpio_pullup_dis(gpio_num);\\n        rtc_gpio_pulldown_en(gpio_num);\\n\\n    If we turn off the ``RTC_PERIPH`` domain, we will use the HOLD feature to maintain the pull-up and pull-down on the pins during sleep. HOLD feature will be acted on the pin internally before the system enters sleep modes, and this can further reduce power consumption::\\n\\n        rtc_gpio_pullup_dis(gpio_num);\\n        rtc_gpio_pulldown_en(gpio_num);\\n\\n    If certain chips lack the ``RTC_PERIPH`` domain, we can only use the HOLD feature to maintain the pull-up and pull-down on the pins during sleep modes::\\n\\n        gpio_pullup_dis(gpio_num);\\n        gpio_pulldown_en(gpio_num);\\n\\n    :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_enable_ext1_wakeup_io` function can be used to append ext1 wakeup IO and set corresponding wakeup level.\\n\\n    :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_disable_ext1_wakeup_io` function can be used to remove ext1 wakeup IO.\\n\\n    .. only:: SOC_PM_SUPPORT_EXT1_WAKEUP_MODE_PER_PIN\\n\\n        The RTC controller also supports triggering wakeup, allowing configurable IO to use different wakeup levels simultaneously. This can be configured with :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_enable_ext1_wakeup_io`.\\n\\n    .. only:: not SOC_PM_SUPPORT_EXT1_WAKEUP_MODE_PER_PIN\\n\\n        .. note::\\n\\n           Due to hardware limitation, when we use more than one IO for EXT1 wakeup, it is not allowed to configure different wakeup levels for the IOs, and there is corresponding inspection mechanism in :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_enable_ext1_wakeup_io`.\\n\\n    .. warning::\\n\\n        - To use the EXT1 wakeup, the IO pad(s) are configured as RTC IO. Therefore, before using these pads as digital GPIOs, users need to reconfigure them by calling the :cpp:func:`rtc_gpio_deinit` function.\\n\\n        - If the RTC peripherals are configured to be powered down (which is by default), the wakeup IOs will be set to the holding state before entering sleep. Therefore, after the chip wakes up from Light-sleep, please call ``rtc_gpio_hold_dis`` to disable the hold function to perform any pin re-configuration. For Deep-sleep wakeup, this is already being handled at the application startup stage.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_ULP_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    ULP Coprocessor Wakeup\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    ULP coprocessor can run while the chip is in sleep mode, and may be used to poll sensors, monitor ADC or touch sensor values, and wake up the chip when a specific event is detected. ULP coprocessor is part of the RTC peripherals power domain, and it runs the program stored in RTC SLOW memory. RTC SLOW memory will be powered on during sleep if this wakeup mode is requested. RTC peripherals will be automatically powered on before ULP coprocessor starts running the program; once the program stops running, RTC peripherals are automatically powered down again.\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32\\n\\n        Revisions 0 and 1 of ESP32 only support this wakeup mode when RTC peripherals are not forced to be powered on (i.e., ESP_PD_DOMAIN_RTC_PERIPH should be set to ESP_PD_OPTION_AUTO).\\n\\n    :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_enable_ulp_wakeup` function can be used to enable this wakeup source.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_RTCIO_WAKE_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    GPIO Wakeup (Light-sleep Only)\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    .. only:: (SOC_PM_SUPPORT_EXT0_WAKEUP or SOC_PM_SUPPORT_EXT1_WAKEUP)\\n\\n        In addition to EXT0 and EXT1 wakeup sources described above, one more method of wakeup from external inputs is available in Light-sleep mode. With this wakeup source, each pin can be individually configured to trigger wakeup on high or low level using :cpp:func:`gpio_wakeup_enable` function. Unlike EXT0 and EXT1 wakeup sources, which can only be used with RTC IOs, this wakeup source can be used with any IO (RTC or digital).\\n\\n    .. only:: not (SOC_PM_SUPPORT_EXT0_WAKEUP or SOC_PM_SUPPORT_EXT1_WAKEUP)\\n\\n        One more method of wakeup from external inputs is available in Light-sleep mode. With this wakeup source, each pin can be individually configured to trigger wakeup on high or low level using :cpp:func:`gpio_wakeup_enable` function. This wakeup source can be used with any IO (RTC or digital).\\n\\n    :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_enable_gpio_wakeup` function can be used to enable this wakeup source.\\n\\n    .. warning::\\n\\n        Before entering Light-sleep mode, check if any GPIO pin to be driven is part of the {IDF_TARGET_SPI_POWER_DOMAIN} power domain. If so, this power domain must be configured to remain ON during sleep.\\n\\n        For example, on ESP32-WROOM-32 board, GPIO16 and GPIO17 are linked to {IDF_TARGET_SPI_POWER_DOMAIN} power domain. If they are configured to remain high during Light-sleep, the power domain should be configured to remain powered ON. This can be done with :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_pd_config()`::\\n\\n            esp_sleep_pd_config(ESP_PD_DOMAIN_VDDSDIO, ESP_PD_OPTION_ON);\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_RTCIO_WAKE_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    GPIO Wakeup\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Any IO can be used as the external input to wake up the chip from Light-sleep. Each pin can be individually configured to trigger wakeup on high or low level using the :cpp:func:`gpio_wakeup_enable` function. Then the :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_enable_gpio_wakeup` function should be called to enable this wakeup source.\\n\\n    Additionally, IOs that are powered by the VDD3P3_RTC power domain can be used to wake up the chip from Deep-sleep. The wakeup pin and wakeup trigger level can be configured by calling :cpp:func:`esp_deep_sleep_enable_gpio_wakeup`. The function will enable the Deep-sleep wakeup for the selected pin.\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32c6 or esp32h2\\n\\n       .. note::\\n\\n           In Light-sleep mode, setting Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_PM_POWER_DOWN_PERIPHERAL_IN_LIGHT_SLEEP` will invalidate GPIO wakeup.\\n\\nUART Wakeup (Light-sleep Only)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen {IDF_TARGET_NAME} receives UART input from external devices, it is often necessary to wake up the chip when input data is available. The UART peripheral contains a feature which allows waking up the chip from Light-sleep when a certain number of positive edges on RX pin are seen. This number of positive edges can be set using :cpp:func:`uart_set_wakeup_threshold` function. Note that the character which triggers wakeup (and any characters before it) will not be received by the UART after wakeup. This means that the external device typically needs to send an extra character to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} to trigger wakeup before sending the data.\\n\\n:cpp:func:`esp_sleep_enable_uart_wakeup` function can be used to enable this wakeup source.\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32c6 or esp32h2\\n\\n       .. note::\\n\\n           In Light-sleep mode, setting Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_PM_POWER_DOWN_PERIPHERAL_IN_LIGHT_SLEEP` will invalidate UART wakeup.\\n\\n.. _disable_sleep_wakeup_source:\\n\\nDisable Sleep Wakeup Source\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nPreviously configured wakeup sources can be disabled later using :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_disable_wakeup_source` API. This function deactivates trigger for the given wakeup source. Additionally, it can disable all triggers if the argument is ``ESP_SLEEP_WAKEUP_ALL``.\\n\\n.. _power_down_options:\\n\\nPower-down Options\\n------------------\\n\\nThe application can force specific powerdown modes for RTC peripherals and RTC memories. In Deep-sleep mode, we can also isolate some IOs to further reduce current consumption.\\n\\nPower-down of RTC Peripherals and Memories\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy default, :cpp:func:`esp_deep_sleep_start` and :cpp:func:`esp_light_sleep_start` functions power down all RTC power domains which are not needed by the enabled wakeup sources. To override this behaviour, :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_pd_config` function is provided.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    Note: in revision 0 of ESP32, RTC FAST memory is always kept enabled in Deep-sleep, so that the Deep-sleep stub can run after reset. This can be overridden, if the application does not need clean reset behaviour after Deep-sleep.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_RTC_SLOW_MEM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    If some variables in the program are placed into RTC SLOW memory (for example, using ``RTC_DATA_ATTR`` attribute), RTC SLOW memory will be kept powered on by default. This can be overridden using :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_pd_config` function, if desired.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_RTC_SLOW_MEM_SUPPORTED and SOC_RTC_FAST_MEM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    In {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, there is only RTC FAST memory, so if some variables in the program are marked by ``RTC_DATA_ATTR``, ``RTC_SLOW_ATTR`` or ``RTC_FAST_ATTR`` attributes, all of them go to RTC FAST memory. It will be kept powered on by default. This can be overridden using :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_pd_config` function, if desired.\\n\\nPower-down of Flash\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy default, to avoid potential issues, :cpp:func:`esp_light_sleep_start` function does **not** power down flash. To be more specific, it takes time to power down the flash and during this period the system may be woken up, which then actually powers up the flash before this flash could be powered down completely. As a result, there is a chance that the flash may not work properly.\\n\\nSo, in theory, it is ok if you only wake up the system after the flash is completely powered down. However, in reality, the flash power-down period can be hard to predict (for example, this period can be much longer when you add filter capacitors to the flash\\'s power supply circuit) and uncontrollable (for example, the asynchronous wake-up signals make the actual sleep time uncontrollable).\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    If a filter capacitor is added to your flash power supply circuit, please do everything possible to avoid powering down flash.\\n\\nTherefore, it is recommended not to power down flash when using ESP-IDF. For power-sensitive applications, it is recommended to use Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SLEEP_FLASH_LEAKAGE_WORKAROUND` to reduce the power consumption of the flash during Light-sleep, instead of powering down the flash.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPIRAM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    It is worth mentioning that PSRAM has a similar Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SLEEP_PSRAM_LEAKAGE_WORKAROUND`.\\n\\nHowever, for those who have fully understood the risk and are still willing to power down the flash to further reduce the power consumption, please check the following mechanisms:\\n\\n    .. list::\\n\\n        - Setting Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SLEEP_POWER_DOWN_FLASH` only powers down the flash when the RTC timer is the only wake-up source **and** the sleep time is longer than the flash power-down period.\\n        - Calling ``esp_sleep_pd_config(ESP_PD_DOMAIN_VDDSDIO, ESP_PD_OPTION_OFF)`` powers down flash when the RTC timer is not enabled as a wakeup source **or** the sleep time is longer than the flash power-down period.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    .. list::\\n\\n        - ESP-IDF does not provide any mechanism that can power down the flash in all conditions when Light-sleep.\\n        - :cpp:func:`esp_deep_sleep_start` function forces power down flash regardless of user configuration.\\n\\nConfiguring IOs (Deep-sleep Only)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSome {IDF_TARGET_NAME} IOs have internal pullups or pulldowns, which are enabled by default. If an external circuit drives this pin in Deep-sleep mode, current consumption may increase due to current flowing through these pullups and pulldowns.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_RTCIO_HOLD_SUPPORTED and SOC_RTCIO_INPUT_OUTPUT_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    To isolate a pin to prevent extra current draw, call :cpp:func:`rtc_gpio_isolate` function.\\n\\n    For example, on ESP32-WROVER module, GPIO12 is pulled up externally, and it also has an internal pulldown in the ESP32 chip. This means that in Deep-sleep, some current flows through these external and internal resistors, increasing Deep-sleep current above the minimal possible value.\\n\\n    Add the following code before :cpp:func:`esp_deep_sleep_start` to remove such extra current::\\n\\n        rtc_gpio_isolate(GPIO_NUM_12);\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c2 or esp32c3\\n\\n    In Deep-sleep mode:\\n        - digital GPIOs (GPIO6 ~ 21) are in a high impedance state.\\n        - RTC GPIOs (GPIO0 ~ 5) can be in the following states, depending on their hold function enabled or not:\\n            - if the hold function is not enabled, RTC GPIOs will be in a high impedance state.\\n            - if the hold function is enabled, RTC GPIOs will retain the pin state latched at that hold moment.\\n\\n.. _enter_sleep:\\n\\nEntering Sleep\\n--------------\\n\\n:cpp:func:`esp_light_sleep_start` or :cpp:func:`esp_deep_sleep_start` functions can be used to enter Light-sleep or Deep-sleep modes correspondingly. After that, the system configures the parameters of RTC controller according to the requested wakeup sources and power-down options.\\n\\nIt is also possible to enter sleep modes with no wakeup sources configured. In this case, the chip will be in sleep modes indefinitely until external reset is applied.\\n\\nUART Output Handling\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBefore entering sleep mode, :cpp:func:`esp_deep_sleep_start` will flush the contents of UART FIFOs.\\n\\nWhen entering Light-sleep mode using :cpp:func:`esp_light_sleep_start`, UART FIFOs will not be flushed. Instead, UART output will be suspended, and remaining characters in the FIFO will be sent out after wakeup from Light-sleep.\\n\\n.. _wakeup_cause:\\n\\nChecking Sleep Wakeup Cause\\n---------------------------\\n\\n:cpp:func:`esp_sleep_get_wakeup_cause` function can be used to check which wakeup source has triggered wakeup from sleep mode.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_TOUCH_SENSOR_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    For touchpad, it is possible to identify which touch pin has caused wakeup using :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_get_touchpad_wakeup_status` functions.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_PM_SUPPORT_EXT1_WAKEUP\\n\\n    For ext1 wakeup sources, it is possible to identify which touch pin has caused wakeup using :cpp:func:`esp_sleep_get_ext1_wakeup_status` functions.\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - :example:`protocols/sntp`: the implementation of basic functionality of Deep-sleep, where ESP module is periodically waken up to retrieve time from NTP server.\\n    - :example:`wifi/power_save`: the usage of Wi-Fi Modem-sleep mode and automatic Light-sleep feature to maintain Wi-Fi connections.\\n    :SOC_BT_SUPPORTED: - :example:`bluetooth/nimble/power_save`: the usage of Bluetooth Modem-sleep mode and automatic Light-sleep feature to maintain Bluetooth connections.\\n    :SOC_ULP_SUPPORTED: - :example:`system/deep_sleep`: the usage of various Deep-sleep wakeup triggers and ULP coprocessor programming.\\n    :not SOC_ULP_SUPPORTED: - :example:`system/deep_sleep`: the usage of Deep-sleep wakeup triggered by various sources supported by the chip (RTC Timer, GPIO, EXT0, EXT1, Touch Sensor, etc.).\\n    - :example:`system/light_sleep`: the usage of Light-sleep wakeup triggered by various sources supported by the chip (Timer, GPIO, Touch Sensor, etc.).\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_sleep.inc\\n',\n",
       " 'Logging library\\n===============\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nThe logging library provides three ways for setting log verbosity:\\n\\n- **At compile time**: in menuconfig, set the verbosity level using the option :ref:`CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL`.\\n- Optionally, also in menuconfig, set the maximum verbosity level using the option :ref:`CONFIG_LOG_MAXIMUM_LEVEL`. By default, this is the same as the default level, but it can be set higher in order to compile more optional logs into the firmware.\\n- **At runtime**: all logs for verbosity levels lower than :ref:`CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL` are enabled by default. The function :cpp:func:`esp_log_level_set` can be used to set a logging level on a per-module basis. Modules are identified by their tags, which are human-readable ASCII zero-terminated strings.\\n- **At runtime**: if :ref:`CONFIG_LOG_MASTER_LEVEL` is enabled then a ``Master logging level`` can be set using :cpp:func:`esp_log_set_level_master`. This option adds an additional logging level check for all compiled logs. Note that this will increase application size. This feature is useful if you want to compile a lot of logs that are selectable at runtime, but also want to avoid the performance hit from looking up the tags and their log level when you don\\'t want log output.\\n\\nThere are the following verbosity levels:\\n\\n- Error (lowest)\\n- Warning\\n- Info\\n- Debug\\n- Verbose (highest)\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The function :cpp:func:`esp_log_level_set` cannot set logging levels higher than specified by :ref:`CONFIG_LOG_MAXIMUM_LEVEL`. To increase log level for a specific file above this maximum at compile time, use the macro `LOG_LOCAL_LEVEL` (see the details below).\\n\\n\\nHow to Use Logging Library\\n--------------------------\\n\\nIn each C file that uses logging functionality, define the TAG variable as shown below:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    static const char* TAG = \"MyModule\";\\n\\nThen use one of logging macros to produce output, e.g:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    ESP_LOGW(TAG, \"Baud rate error %.1f%%. Requested: %d baud, actual: %d baud\", error * 100, baud_req, baud_real);\\n\\nSeveral macros are available for different verbosity levels:\\n\\n* ``ESP_LOGE`` - Error (lowest)\\n* ``ESP_LOGW`` - Warning\\n* ``ESP_LOGI`` - Info\\n* ``ESP_LOGD`` - Debug\\n* ``ESP_LOGV`` - Verbose (highest)\\n\\nAdditionally, there are ``ESP_EARLY_LOGx`` versions for each of these macros, e.g. :c:macro:`ESP_EARLY_LOGE`. These versions have to be used explicitly in the early startup code only, before heap allocator and syscalls have been initialized. Normal ``ESP_LOGx`` macros can also be used while compiling the bootloader, but they will fall back to the same implementation as ``ESP_EARLY_LOGx`` macros.\\n\\nThere are also ``ESP_DRAM_LOGx`` versions for each of these macros, e.g. :c:macro:`ESP_DRAM_LOGE`. These versions are used in some places where logging may occur with interrupts disabled or with flash cache inaccessible. Use of this macros should be as sparse as possible, as logging in these types of code should be avoided for performance reasons.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Inside critical sections interrupts are disabled so it\\'s only possible to use ``ESP_DRAM_LOGx`` (preferred) or ``ESP_EARLY_LOGx``. Even though it\\'s possible to log in these situations, it\\'s better if your program can be structured not to require it.\\n\\nTo override default verbosity level at file or component scope, define the ``LOG_LOCAL_LEVEL`` macro.\\n\\nAt file scope, define it before including ``esp_log.h``, e.g.:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    #define LOG_LOCAL_LEVEL ESP_LOG_VERBOSE\\n    #include \"esp_log.h\"\\n\\nAt component scope, define it in the component CMakeLists:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n    target_compile_definitions(${COMPONENT_LIB} PUBLIC \"-DLOG_LOCAL_LEVEL=ESP_LOG_VERBOSE\")\\n\\nTo configure logging output per module at runtime, add calls to the function :cpp:func:`esp_log_level_set` as follows:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n   esp_log_level_set(\"*\", ESP_LOG_ERROR);        // set all components to ERROR level\\n   esp_log_level_set(\"wifi\", ESP_LOG_WARN);      // enable WARN logs from WiFi stack\\n   esp_log_level_set(\"dhcpc\", ESP_LOG_INFO);     // enable INFO logs from DHCP client\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The \"DRAM\" and \"EARLY\" log macro variants documented above do not support per module setting of log verbosity. These macros will always log at the \"default\" verbosity level, which can only be changed at runtime by calling ``esp_log_level(\"*\", level)``.\\n\\nEven when logs are disabled by using a tag name, they will still require a processing time of around 10.9 microseconds per entry.\\n\\nMaster Logging Level\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTo enable the Master logging level feature, the :ref:`CONFIG_LOG_MASTER_LEVEL` option must be enabled. It adds an additional level check for ``ESP_LOGx`` macros before calling :cpp:func:`esp_log_write`. This allows to set a higher :ref:`CONFIG_LOG_MAXIMUM_LEVEL`, but not inflict a performance hit during normal operation (only when directed). An application may set the master logging level (:cpp:func:`esp_log_set_level_master`) globally to enforce a maximum log level. ``ESP_LOGx`` macros above this level will be skipped immediately, rather than calling :cpp:func:`esp_log_write` and doing a tag lookup. It is recommended to only use this in an top-level application and not in shared components as this would override the global log level for any user using the component. By default, at startup, the Master logging level is :ref:`CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL`.\\n\\nNote that this feature increases application size because the additional check is added into all ``ESP_LOGx`` macros.\\n\\nThe snippet below shows how it works. Setting the Master logging level to ``ESP_LOG_NONE`` disables all logging globally. :cpp:func:`esp_log_level_set` does not currently affect logging. But after the Master logging level is released, the logs will be printed as set by :cpp:func:`esp_log_level_set`.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    // Master logging level is CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL at start up and = ESP_LOG_INFO\\n    ESP_LOGI(\"lib_name\", \"Message for print\");          // prints a INFO message\\n    esp_log_level_set(\"lib_name\", ESP_LOG_WARN);        // enables WARN logs from lib_name\\n\\n    esp_log_set_level_master(ESP_LOG_NONE);             // disables all logs globally. esp_log_level_set has no effect at the moment\\n\\n    ESP_LOGW(\"lib_name\", \"Message for print\");          // no print, Master logging level blocks it\\n    esp_log_level_set(\"lib_name\", ESP_LOG_INFO);        // enable INFO logs from lib_name\\n    ESP_LOGI(\"lib_name\", \"Message for print\");          // no print, Master logging level blocks it\\n\\n    esp_log_set_level_master(ESP_LOG_INFO);             // enables all INFO logs globally\\n\\n    ESP_LOGI(\"lib_name\", \"Message for print\");          // prints a INFO message\\n\\nLogging to Host via JTAG\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy default, the logging library uses the vprintf-like function to write formatted output to the dedicated UART. By calling a simple API, all log output may be routed to JTAG instead, making logging several times faster. For details, please refer to Section :ref:`app_trace-logging-to-host`.\\n\\nThread Safety\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe log string is first written into a memory buffer and then sent to the UART for printing. Log calls are thread-safe, i.e., logs of different threads do not conflict with each other.\\n\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe logging library is commonly used by most ESP-IDF components and examples. For demonstration of log functionality, check ESP-IDF\\'s :idf:`examples` directory. The most relevant examples that deal with logging are the following:\\n\\n* :example:`system/ota`\\n* :example:`storage/sd_card`\\n* :example:`protocols/https_request`\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_log.inc\\n',\n",
       " 'Memory Management for MMU Supported Memory\\n******************************************\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\n.. toctree::\\n    :maxdepth: 1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n============\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Memory Management Unit (MMU) is relatively simple. It can do memory address translation between physical memory addresses and virtual memory addresses. So CPU can access physical memories via virtual addresses. There are multiple types of virtual memory addresses, which have different capabilities.\\n\\nESP-IDF provides a memory mapping driver that manages the relation between these physical memory addresses and virtual memory addresses, so as to achieve some features such as reading from SPI flash via a pointer.\\n\\nMemory mapping driver is actually a capabilities-based virtual memory address allocator that allows applications to make virtual memory address allocations for different purposes. In the following chapters, we call this driver ``esp_mmap`` driver.\\n\\nESP-IDF also provides a memory synchronization driver which can be used for potential memory desynchronization scenarios.\\n\\nPhysical Memory Types\\n=====================\\n\\nMemory mapping driver currently supports mapping to following physical memory type(s):\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - SPI flash\\n    :SOC_SPIRAM_SUPPORTED and not esp32: - PSRAM\\n\\n\\nVirtual Memory Capabilities\\n===========================\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - :cpp:enumerator:`MMU_MEM_CAP_EXEC`: This capability indicates that the virtual memory address has the execute permission. Note this permission scope is within the MMU hardware.\\n    - :cpp:enumerator:`MMU_MEM_CAP_READ`: This capability indicates that the virtual memory address has the read permission. Note this permission scope is within the MMU hardware.\\n    - :cpp:enumerator:`MMU_MEM_CAP_WRITE`: This capability indicates that the virtual memory address has the write permission. Note this permission scope is within the MMU hardware.\\n    - :cpp:enumerator:`MMU_MEM_CAP_32BIT`: This capability indicates that the virtual memory address allows for 32 bits or multiples of 32 bits access.\\n    - :cpp:enumerator:`MMU_MEM_CAP_8BIT`: This capability indicates that the virtual memory address allows for 8 bits or multiples of 8 bits access.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n\\n    8 MB external memory addresses (from 0x40400000 to 0x40C00000) which have the :cpp:enumerator:`MMU_MEM_CAP_EXEC` and :cpp:enumerator:`MMU_MEM_CAP_READ` capabilities are not available for users to allocate, due to hardware limitations.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s2\\n\\n    4 MB external memory addresses (from 0x40400000 to 0x40800000) which have the :cpp:enumerator:`MMU_MEM_CAP_EXEC` and :cpp:enumerator:`MMU_MEM_CAP_READ` capabilities are not avaiable for users to allocate, due to hardware limitations.\\n\\n\\nYou can call :cpp:func:`esp_mmu_map_get_max_consecutive_free_block_size` to know the largest consecutive mappable block size with certain capabilities.\\n\\n\\nMemory Management Drivers\\n=========================\\n\\n\\nDriver Concept\\n--------------\\n\\n\\nTerminology\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe virtual memory pool is made up with one or multiple virtual memory regions, see below figure:\\n\\n.. image:: /../_static/diagrams/mmu/mem_pool.png\\n    :scale: 80 %\\n    :align: center\\n\\n\\n- A virtual memory pool stands for the whole virtual address range that can be mapped to physical memory.\\n- A virtual memory region is a range of virtual address with same attributes.\\n- A virtual memory block is a piece of virtual address range that is dynamically mapped.\\n- A slot is the virtual address range between two virtual memory blocks.\\n- A physical memory block is a piece of physical address range that is to-be-mapped or already mapped to a virtual memory block.\\n- Dynamical mapping is done by calling ``esp_mmap`` driver API :cpp:func:`esp_mmu_map`. This API maps the given physical memory block to a virtual memory block which is allocated by the ``esp_mmap`` driver.\\n\\n\\nRelation Between Memory Blocks\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen mapping a physical memory block A, block A can have one of the following relations with another previously mapped physical memory block B:\\n\\n- Enclosed: block A is completely enclosed within block B, see figure below:\\n\\n  .. image:: /../_static/diagrams/mmu/enclosed.png\\n    :scale: 80 %\\n    :align: center\\n\\n- Identical: block A is completely the same as block B, see figure below:\\n\\n  .. image:: /../_static/diagrams/mmu/identical.png\\n    :scale: 80 %\\n    :align: center\\n\\n  Note that ``esp_mmap`` driver considers the identical scenario **the same as the enclosed scenario**.\\n\\n- Overlapped: block A is overlapped with block B, see figure below:\\n\\n  .. image:: /../_static/diagrams/mmu/overlapped.png\\n    :scale: 80 %\\n    :align: center\\n\\n  There is a special condition, when block A entirely encloses block B, see figure below:\\n\\n  .. image:: /../_static/diagrams/mmu/inversed_enclosed.png\\n    :scale: 70 %\\n    :align: center\\n\\n  Note that ``esp_mmap`` driver considers this scenario **the same as the overlapped scenario**.\\n\\n\\nDriver Behaviour\\n----------------\\n\\nMemory Map\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nYou can call :cpp:func:`esp_mmu_map` to do a dynamical mapping. This API can allocate a certain size of virtual memory block according to the virtual memory capabilities you selected, then map this virtual memory block to the physical memory block as you requested. The ``esp_mmap`` driver supports mapping to one or more types of physical memory, so you should specify the physical memory target when mapping.\\n\\nBy default, physical memory blocks and virtual memory blocks are one-to-one mapped. This means, when calling :cpp:func:`esp_mmu_map`:\\n\\n* If it is the enclosed scenario, this API will return an :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE`. The ``out_ptr`` will be assigned to the start virtual memory address of the previously mapped one which encloses the to-be-mapped one.\\n* If it is the identical scenario, this API will behaves exactly the same as the enclosed scenario.\\n* If it is the overlapped scenario, this API will by default return an :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG`. This means, ``esp_mmap`` driver by default does not allow mapping a physical memory address to multiple virtual memory addresses.\\n\\nSpecially, you can use :c:macro:`ESP_MMU_MMAP_FLAG_PADDR_SHARED`. This flag stands for one-to-multiple mapping between a physical address and multiple virtual addresses:\\n\\n* If it is the overlapped scenario, this API will allocate a new virtual memory block as requested, then map to the given physical memory block.\\n\\n\\nMemory Unmap\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nYou can call :cpp:func:`esp_mmu_unmap` to unmap a previously mapped memory block. This API returns an :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` if you are trying to unmap a virtual memory block that is not mapped to any physical memory block yet.\\n\\n\\nMemory Address Conversion\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe ``esp_mmap`` driver provides two helper APIs to do the conversion between virtual memory address and physical memory address：\\n\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_mmu_vaddr_to_paddr` converts virtual address to physical address.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_mmu_paddr_to_vaddr` converts physical address to virtual address.\\n\\n\\nMemory Synchronization\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nMMU supported physical memories can be accessed by one or multiple methods.\\n\\nSPI flash can be accessed by SPI1 (ESP-IDF ``esp_flash`` driver APIs), or by pointers. ESP-IDF ``esp_flash`` driver APIs have already considered the memory synchronization, so users do not need to worry about this.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPIRAM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    PSRAM can be accessed by pointers, hardware guarantees the data consistency when PSRAM is only accessed via pointers.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s3\\n\\n    PSRAM can also be accessed by EDMA. Data desynchronization may happen because hardware does not guarantee the data consistency under such condition. You should call :cpp:func:`esp_cache_msync` to synchronize the Cache and the PSRAM.\\n\\n    See :doc:`/api-reference/system/mm_sync` for more details.\\n\\n\\nThread Safety\\n=============\\n\\nAPIs in ``esp_mmu_map.h`` are not guaranteed to be thread-safe.\\n\\nAPIs in ``esp_cache.h`` are guaranteed to be thread-safe.\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n=============\\n\\nAPI Reference - ESP MMAP Driver\\n-------------------------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_mmu_map.inc\\n',\n",

       " 'Inter-Processor Call (IPC)\\n==========================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    IPC stands for an **\"Inter-Processor Call\"** and **NOT** \"Inter-Process Communication\" as found on other operating systems.\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nDue to the dual core nature of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, there are some scenarios where a certain callback must be executed from a particular core such as:\\n\\n- When allocating an ISR to an interrupt source of a particular core (applies to freeing a particular core\\'s interrupt source as well)\\n- On particular chips (such as the ESP32), accessing memory that is exclusive to a particular core (such as RTC Fast Memory)\\n- Reading the registers/state of another core\\n\\nThe IPC (Inter-Processor Call) feature allows a particular core (the calling core) to trigger the execution of a callback function on another core (the target core). The IPC feature allows execution of a callback function on the target core in either a task context, or an interrupt context. Depending on the context that the callback function is executed in, different restrictions apply to the implementation of the callback function.\\n\\nIPC in Task Context\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe IPC feature implements callback execution in a task context by creating an IPC task for each core during application startup. When the calling core needs to execute a callback on the target core, the callback will execute in the context of the target core\\'s IPC task.\\n\\nWhen using IPCs in a task context, users need to consider the following:\\n\\n- IPC callbacks should ideally be simple and short. An IPC callback **must never block or yield**.\\n- The IPC tasks are created at the highest possible priority (i.e., ``configMAX_PRIORITIES - 1``).\\n\\n    - If :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_IPC_USES_CALLERS_PRIORITY` is enabled, the target core\\'s IPC task will be lowered to the current priority of the target core before executing the callback.\\n    - If :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_IPC_USES_CALLERS_PRIORITY` is disabled, the target core will always execute the callback at the highest possible priority.\\n\\n- Depending on the complexity of the callback, users may need to configure the stack size of the IPC task via :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_IPC_TASK_STACK_SIZE`.\\n- The IPC feature is internally protected by a mutex. Therefore, simultaneous IPC calls from two or more calling core\\'s are serialized on a first come first serve basis.\\n\\nAPI Usage\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTask Context IPC callbacks have the following restrictions:\\n\\n- The callback must be of the :cpp:type:`esp_ipc_func_t` type.\\n- The callback **must never block or yield** as this will result in the target core\\'s IPC task blocking or yielding.\\n- The callback must avoid changing any aspect of the IPC task\\'s state, e.g., by calling ``vTaskPrioritySet(NULL, x)``.\\n\\nThe IPC feature offers the API listed below to execute a callback in a task context on a target core. The API allows the calling core to block until the callback\\'s execution has completed, or return immediately once the callback\\'s execution has started.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_ipc_call` triggers an IPC call on the target core. This function will block until the target core\\'s IPC task **begins** execution of the callback.\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_ipc_call_blocking` triggers an IPC on the target core. This function will block until the target core\\'s IPC task **completes** execution of the callback.\\n\\nIPC in Interrupt Context\\n------------------------\\n\\nIn some cases, we need to quickly obtain the state of another core such as in a core dump, GDB stub, various unit tests, and hardware errata workarounds. The IPC ISR feature implements callback execution from a High Priority Interrupt context by reserving a High Priority Interrupt on each core for IPC usage. When a calling core needs to execute a callback on the target core, the callback will execute in the context of the High Priority Interrupt of the target core.\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_XTENSA\\n\\n    For such scenarios, the IPC ISR feature supports execution of callbacks in a :doc:`High Priority Interrupt </api-guides/hlinterrupts>` context.\\n\\nWhen using IPCs in High Priority Interrupt context, users need to consider the following:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    :CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_XTENSA: - Since the callback is executed in a High Priority Interrupt context, the callback must be written entirely in assembly. See the API Usage below for more details regarding writing assembly callbacks.\\n    - The priority of the reserved High Priority Interrupt is dependent on the :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_CHECK_INT_LEVEL` option.\\n\\nWhen the callback executes, users need to consider the following:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - The calling core will disable interrupts of priority level 3 and lower.\\n    :CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_XTENSA: - Although the priority of the reserved interrupt depends on :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_CHECK_INT_LEVEL`, during the execution of IPC ISR callback, the target core will disable interrupts of priority level 5 and lower regardless of what :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_CHECK_INT_LEVEL` is set to.\\n    :CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_RISCV: - Although the priority of the reserved interrupt depends on :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_CHECK_INT_LEVEL`, during the execution of IPC ISR callback, the target core will disable all interrupts.\\n\\nAPI Usage\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_XTENSA\\n\\n    High Priority Interrupt IPC callbacks have the following restrictions:\\n\\n    - The callback must be of type :cpp:type:`esp_ipc_isr_func_t` but implemented entirely in assembly.\\n    - The callback is invoked via the ``CALLX0`` instruction with register windowing disabled, thus the callback:\\n        - must not call any register window related instructions, e.g., ``entry`` and ``retw``.\\n        - must not call other C functions as register windowing is disabled.\\n    - The callback should be placed in IRAM at a 4-byte aligned address.\\n    - On invocation of, or after returning from the callback, the registers ``a2, a3, a4`` are saved/restored automatically, thus can be used in the callback. The callback should **ONLY** use those registers.\\n        - ``a2`` contains the ``void *arg`` of the callback.\\n        - ``a3/a4`` are free to use as scratch registers.\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_RISCV\\n\\n    High Priority Interrupt IPC callbacks must be of type :cpp:type:`esp_ipc_isr_func_t` and have the same restrictions as for regular interrupt handlers. The callback function can be written in C.\\n\\nThe IPC feature offers the API listed below to execute a callback in a High Priority Interrupt context:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_ipc_isr_call` triggers an IPC call on the target core. This function will busy-wait until the target core **begins** execution of the callback.\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_ipc_isr_call_blocking` triggers an IPC call on the target core. This function will busy-wait until the target core **completes** execution of the callback.\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_XTENSA\\n\\n    The following code-blocks demonstrates a High Priority Interrupt IPC callback written in assembly that simply reads the target core\\'s cycle count:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: asm\\n\\n        /* esp_test_ipc_isr_get_cycle_count_other_cpu(void *arg) */\\n        // this function reads CCOUNT of the target core and stores it in arg.\\n        // use only a2, a3 and a4 regs here.\\n        .section    .iram1, \"ax\"\\n        .align      4\\n        .global     esp_test_ipc_isr_get_cycle_count_other_cpu\\n        .type       esp_test_ipc_isr_get_cycle_count_other_cpu, @function\\n        // Args:\\n        // a2 - void* arg\\n        esp_test_ipc_isr_get_cycle_count_other_cpu:\\n        rsr.ccount a3\\n        s32i    a3, a2, 0\\n        ret\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        unit32_t cycle_count;\\n        esp_ipc_isr_call_blocking(esp_test_ipc_isr_get_cycle_count_other_cpu, (void *)cycle_count);\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        The number of scratch registers available for use is sufficient for most simple use cases. But if your callback requires more scratch registers, ``void *arg`` can point to a buffer that is used as a register save area. The callback can then save and restore more registers. See the :example:`system/ipc/ipc_isr`.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        For more examples of High Priority Interrupt IPC callbacks, you can refer to :idf_file:`components/esp_system/port/arch/xtensa/esp_ipc_isr_routines.S` and :idf_file:`components/esp_system/test_apps/esp_system_unity_tests/main/port/arch/xtensa/test_ipc_isr.S`.\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_RISCV\\n\\n    See :idf_file:`examples/system/ipc/ipc_isr/riscv/main/main.c` for an example of its use.\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_XTENSA\\n\\n    See :idf_file:`examples/system/ipc/ipc_isr/xtensa/main/main.c` for an example of its use.\\n\\nThe High Priority Interrupt IPC API also provides the following convenience functions that can stall/resume the target core. These APIs utilize the High Priority Interrupt IPC, but supply their own internal callbacks:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    :CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_RISCV: - :cpp:func:`esp_ipc_isr_stall_other_cpu` stalls the target core. The calling core disables interrupts of level 3 and lower, while the target core will busy-wait with all interrupts disabled. The target core will busy-wait until :cpp:func:`esp_ipc_isr_release_other_cpu` is called.\\n    :CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_XTENSA: - :cpp:func:`esp_ipc_isr_stall_other_cpu` stalls the target core. The calling core disables interrupts of level 3 and lower while the target core will busy-wait with interrupts of level 5 and lower disabled. The target core will busy-wait until :cpp:func:`esp_ipc_isr_release_other_cpu` is called.\\n    - :cpp:func:`esp_ipc_isr_release_other_cpu` resumes the target core.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_ipc.inc\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_ipc_isr.inc\\n',\n",

       " 'NimBLE-based Host APIs\\n**********************\\n\\nOverview\\n========\\n\\nApache MyNewt NimBLE is a highly configurable and Bluetooth® SIG qualifiable Bluetooth Low Energy (Bluetooth LE) stack providing both host and controller functionalities. ESP-IDF supports NimBLE host stack which is specifically ported for ESP32 platform and FreeRTOS. The underlying controller is still the same (as in case of Bluedroid) providing VHCI interface. Refer to  `NimBLE user guide <https://mynewt.apache.org/latest/network/index.html>`_ for a complete list of features and additional information on NimBLE stack. Most features of NimBLE including Bluetooth Low Energy Mesh are supported by ESP-IDF. The porting layer is kept cleaner by maintaining all the existing APIs of NimBLE along with a single ESP-NimBLE API for initialization, making it simpler for the application developers.\\n\\nArchitecture\\n============\\n\\nCurrently, NimBLE host and controller support different transports such as UART and RAM between them. However, RAM transport cannot be used as is in case of ESP as ESP controller supports VHCI interface and buffering schemes used by NimBLE host is incompatible with that used by ESP controller. Therefore, a new transport between NimBLE host and ESP controller has been added. This is depicted in the figure below. This layer is responsible for maintaining pool of transport buffers and formatting buffers exchanges between host and controller as per the requirements.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../../_static/esp32_nimble_stack.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: ESP NimBLE Stack.\\n    :scale: 50\\n\\n    ESP NimBLE Stack\\n\\n\\nThreading Model\\n===============\\n\\nThe NimBLE host can run inside the application thread or can have its own independent thread. This flexibility is inherently provided by NimBLE design. By default, a thread is spawned by the porting function ``nimble_port_freertos_init``. This behavior can be changed by overriding the same function. For Bluetooth Low Energy Mesh, additional thread (advertising thread) is used which keeps on feeding advertisement events to the main thread.\\n\\nProgramming Sequence\\n====================\\n\\nTo begin with, make sure that the NimBLE stack is enabled from menuconfig :ref:`choose NimBLE for the Bluetooth host <CONFIG_BT_HOST>`.\\n\\nTypical programming sequence with NimBLE stack consists of the following steps:\\n    * Initialize NVS flash using :cpp:func:`nvs_flash_init` API. This is because ESP controller uses NVS during initialization.\\n    * Initialize the host and controller stack using ``nimble_port_init``.\\n    * Initialize the required NimBLE host configuration parameters and callbacks\\n    * Perform application specific tasks/initialization\\n    * Run the thread for host stack using ``nimble_port_freertos_init``\\n\\nThis documentation does not cover NimBLE APIs. Refer to `NimBLE tutorial <https://mynewt.apache.org/latest/network/index.html#ble-user-guide>`_ for more details on the programming sequence/NimBLE APIs for different scenarios.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n=============\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_nimble_hci.inc\\n',\n",
       " 'General Purpose Timer (GPTimer)\\n===============================\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nGPTimer (General Purpose Timer) is the driver of {IDF_TARGET_NAME} Timer Group peripheral. The hardware timer features high resolution and flexible alarm action. The behavior when the internal counter of a timer reaches a specific target value is called a timer alarm. When a timer alarms, a user registered per-timer callback would be called.\\n\\nTypically, a general purpose timer can be used in scenarios like:\\n\\n- Free running as a wall clock, fetching a high-resolution timestamp at any time and any places\\n- Generate period alarms, trigger events periodically\\n- Generate one-shot alarm, respond in target time\\n\\nFunctional Overview\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe following sections of this document cover the typical steps to install and operate a timer:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - :ref:`gptimer-resource-allocation` - covers which parameters should be set up to get a timer handle and how to recycle the resources when GPTimer finishes working.\\n    - :ref:`set-and-get-count-value` - covers how to force the timer counting from a start point and how to get the count value at anytime.\\n    - :ref:`set-up-alarm-action` - covers the parameters that should be set up to enable the alarm event.\\n    - :ref:`gptimer-register-event-callbacks` - covers how to hook user specific code to the alarm event callback function.\\n    - :ref:`enable-and-disable-timer` - covers how to enable and disable the timer.\\n    - :ref:`start-and-stop-timer` - shows some typical use cases that start the timer with different alarm behavior.\\n    :SOC_ETM_SUPPORTED and SOC_TIMER_SUPPORT_ETM: - :ref:`gptimer-etm-event-and-task` - describes what the events and tasks can be connected to the ETM channel.\\n    - :ref:`gptimer-power-management` - describes how different source clock selections can affect power consumption.\\n    - :ref:`gptimer-iram-safe` - describes tips on how to make the timer interrupt and IO control functions work better along with a disabled cache.\\n    - :ref:`gptimer-thread-safety` - lists which APIs are guaranteed to be thread safe by the driver.\\n    - :ref:`gptimer-kconfig-options` - lists the supported Kconfig options that can be used to make a different effect on driver behavior.\\n\\n.. _gptimer-resource-allocation:\\n\\nResource Allocation\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nDifferent ESP chips might have different numbers of independent timer groups, and within each group, there could also be several independent timers. [1]_\\n\\nA GPTimer instance is represented by :cpp:type:`gptimer_handle_t`. The driver behind manages all available hardware resources in a pool, so that you do not need to care about which timer and which group it belongs to.\\n\\nTo install a timer instance, there is a configuration structure that needs to be given in advance: :cpp:type:`gptimer_config_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`gptimer_config_t::clk_src` selects the source clock for the timer. The available clocks are listed in :cpp:type:`gptimer_clock_source_t`, you can only pick one of them. For the effect on power consumption of different clock source, please refer to Section :ref:`gptimer-power-management`.\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`gptimer_config_t::direction` sets the counting direction of the timer, supported directions are listed in :cpp:type:`gptimer_count_direction_t`, you can only pick one of them.\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`gptimer_config_t::resolution_hz` sets the resolution of the internal counter. Each count step is equivalent to **1 / resolution_hz** seconds.\\n\\n-  :cpp:member:`gptimer_config::intr_priority` sets the priority of the timer interrupt. If it is set to ``0``, the driver will allocate an interrupt with a default priority. Otherwise, the driver will use the given priority.\\n\\n-  Optional :cpp:member:`gptimer_config_t::intr_shared` sets whether or not mark the timer interrupt source as a shared one. For the pros/cons of a shared interrupt, you can refer to :doc:`Interrupt Handling <../../api-reference/system/intr_alloc>`.\\n\\nWith all the above configurations set in the structure, the structure can be passed to :cpp:func:`gptimer_new_timer` which will instantiate the timer instance and return a handle of the timer.\\n\\nThe function can fail due to various errors such as insufficient memory, invalid arguments, etc. Specifically, when there are no more free timers (i.e., all hardware resources have been used up), then :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` will be returned. The total number of available timers is represented by the :c:macro:`SOC_TIMER_GROUP_TOTAL_TIMERS` and its value depends on the ESP chip.\\n\\nIf a previously created GPTimer instance is no longer required, you should recycle the timer by calling :cpp:func:`gptimer_del_timer`. This allows the underlying HW timer to be used for other purposes. Before deleting a GPTimer handle, please disable it by :cpp:func:`gptimer_disable` in advance or make sure it has not enabled yet by :cpp:func:`gptimer_enable`.\\n\\nCreating a GPTimer Handle with Resolution of 1 MHz\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n   gptimer_handle_t gptimer = NULL;\\n   gptimer_config_t timer_config = {\\n       .clk_src = GPTIMER_CLK_SRC_DEFAULT,\\n       .direction = GPTIMER_COUNT_UP,\\n       .resolution_hz = 1 * 1000 * 1000, // 1MHz, 1 tick = 1us\\n   };\\n   ESP_ERROR_CHECK(gptimer_new_timer(&timer_config, &gptimer));\\n\\n.. _set-and-get-count-value:\\n\\nSet and Get Count Value\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen the GPTimer is created, the internal counter will be reset to zero by default. The counter value can be updated asynchronously by :cpp:func:`gptimer_set_raw_count`. The maximum count value is dependent on the bit width of the hardware timer, which is also reflected by the SOC macro :c:macro:`SOC_TIMER_GROUP_COUNTER_BIT_WIDTH`. When updating the raw count of an active timer, the timer will immediately start counting from the new value.\\n\\nCount value can be retrieved by :cpp:func:`gptimer_get_raw_count`, at any time.\\n\\n.. _set-up-alarm-action:\\n\\nSet up Alarm Action\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFor most of the use cases of GPTimer, you should set up the alarm action before starting the timer, except for the simple wall-clock scenario, where a free running timer is enough. To set up the alarm action, you should configure several members of :cpp:type:`gptimer_alarm_config_t` based on how you make use of the alarm event:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`gptimer_alarm_config_t::alarm_count` sets the target count value that triggers the alarm event. You should also take the counting direction into consideration when setting the alarm value. Specially, :cpp:member:`gptimer_alarm_config_t::alarm_count` and :cpp:member:`gptimer_alarm_config_t::reload_count` cannot be set to the same value when :cpp:member:`gptimer_alarm_config_t::auto_reload_on_alarm` is true, as keeping reload with a target alarm count is meaningless.\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`gptimer_alarm_config_t::reload_count` sets the count value to be reloaded when the alarm event happens. This configuration only takes effect when :cpp:member:`gptimer_alarm_config_t::auto_reload_on_alarm` is set to true.\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`gptimer_alarm_config_t::auto_reload_on_alarm` flag sets whether to enable the auto-reload feature. If enabled, the hardware timer will reload the value of :cpp:member:`gptimer_alarm_config_t::reload_count` into counter immediately when an alarm event happens.\\n\\nTo make the alarm configurations take effect, you should call :cpp:func:`gptimer_set_alarm_action`. Especially, if :cpp:type:`gptimer_alarm_config_t` is set to ``NULL``, the alarm function will be disabled.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    If an alarm value is set and the timer has already exceeded this value, the alarm will be triggered immediately.\\n\\n.. _gptimer-register-event-callbacks:\\n\\nRegister Event Callbacks\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAfter the timer starts up, it can generate a specific event (e.g., the \"Alarm Event\") dynamically. If you have some functions that should be called when the event happens, please hook your function to the interrupt service routine by calling :cpp:func:`gptimer_register_event_callbacks`. All supported event callbacks are listed in :cpp:type:`gptimer_event_callbacks_t`:\\n\\n-  :cpp:member:`gptimer_event_callbacks_t::on_alarm` sets a callback function for alarm events. As this function is called within the ISR context, you must ensure that the function does not attempt to block (e.g., by making sure that only FreeRTOS APIs with ``ISR`` suffix are called from within the function). The function prototype is declared in :cpp:type:`gptimer_alarm_cb_t`.\\n\\nYou can save your own context to :cpp:func:`gptimer_register_event_callbacks` as well, via the parameter ``user_data``. The user data will be directly passed to the callback function.\\n\\nThis function lazy installs the interrupt service for the timer but not enable it. So please call this function before :cpp:func:`gptimer_enable`, otherwise the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` error will be returned. See Section :ref:`enable-and-disable-timer` for more information.\\n\\n.. _enable-and-disable-timer:\\n\\nEnable and Disable Timer\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBefore doing IO control to the timer, you needs to enable the timer first, by calling :cpp:func:`gptimer_enable`. This function:\\n\\n* Switches the timer driver state from **init** to **enable**.\\n* Enables the interrupt service if it has been lazy installed by :cpp:func:`gptimer_register_event_callbacks`.\\n* Acquires a proper power management lock if a specific clock source (e.g., APB clock) is selected. See Section :ref:`gptimer-power-management` for more information.\\n\\nCalling :cpp:func:`gptimer_disable` does the opposite, that is, put the timer driver back to the **init** state, disable the interrupts service and release the power management lock.\\n\\n.. _start-and-stop-timer:\\n\\nStart and Stop Timer\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe basic IO operation of a timer is to start and stop. Calling :cpp:func:`gptimer_start` can make the internal counter work, while calling :cpp:func:`gptimer_stop` can make the counter stop working. The following illustrates how to start a timer with or without an alarm event.\\n\\nCalling :cpp:func:`gptimer_start` transits the driver state from **enable** to **run**, and vice versa. You need to make sure the start and stop functions are used in pairs, otherwise, the functions may return :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE`. Most of the time, this error means that the timer is already stopped or in the \"start protection\" state (i.e., :cpp:func:`gptimer_start` is called but not finished).\\n\\nStart Timer as a Wall Clock\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(gptimer_enable(gptimer));\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(gptimer_start(gptimer));\\n    // Retrieve the timestamp at any time\\n    uint64_t count;\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(gptimer_get_raw_count(gptimer, &count));\\n\\nTrigger Period Events\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    typedef struct {\\n        uint64_t event_count;\\n    } example_queue_element_t;\\n\\n    static bool example_timer_on_alarm_cb(gptimer_handle_t timer, const gptimer_alarm_event_data_t *edata, void *user_ctx)\\n    {\\n        BaseType_t high_task_awoken = pdFALSE;\\n        QueueHandle_t queue = (QueueHandle_t)user_ctx;\\n        // Retrieve the count value from event data\\n        example_queue_element_t ele = {\\n            .event_count = edata->count_value\\n        };\\n        // Optional: send the event data to other task by OS queue\\n        // Do not introduce complex logics in callbacks\\n        // Suggest dealing with event data in the main loop, instead of in this callback\\n        xQueueSendFromISR(queue, &ele, &high_task_awoken);\\n        // return whether we need to yield at the end of ISR\\n        return high_task_awoken == pdTRUE;\\n    }\\n\\n    gptimer_alarm_config_t alarm_config = {\\n        .reload_count = 0, // counter will reload with 0 on alarm event\\n        .alarm_count = 1000000, // period = 1s @resolution 1MHz\\n        .flags.auto_reload_on_alarm = true, // enable auto-reload\\n    };\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(gptimer_set_alarm_action(gptimer, &alarm_config));\\n\\n    gptimer_event_callbacks_t cbs = {\\n        .on_alarm = example_timer_on_alarm_cb, // register user callback\\n    };\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(gptimer_register_event_callbacks(gptimer, &cbs, queue));\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(gptimer_enable(gptimer));\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(gptimer_start(gptimer));\\n\\nTrigger One-Shot Event\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    typedef struct {\\n        uint64_t event_count;\\n    } example_queue_element_t;\\n\\n    static bool example_timer_on_alarm_cb(gptimer_handle_t timer, const gptimer_alarm_event_data_t *edata, void *user_ctx)\\n    {\\n        BaseType_t high_task_awoken = pdFALSE;\\n        QueueHandle_t queue = (QueueHandle_t)user_ctx;\\n        // Stop timer the sooner the better\\n        gptimer_stop(timer);\\n        // Retrieve the count value from event data\\n        example_queue_element_t ele = {\\n            .event_count = edata->count_value\\n        };\\n        // Optional: send the event data to other task by OS queue\\n        xQueueSendFromISR(queue, &ele, &high_task_awoken);\\n        // return whether we need to yield at the end of ISR\\n        return high_task_awoken == pdTRUE;\\n    }\\n\\n    gptimer_alarm_config_t alarm_config = {\\n        .alarm_count = 1 * 1000 * 1000, // alarm target = 1s @resolution 1MHz\\n    };\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(gptimer_set_alarm_action(gptimer, &alarm_config));\\n\\n    gptimer_event_callbacks_t cbs = {\\n        .on_alarm = example_timer_on_alarm_cb, // register user callback\\n    };\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(gptimer_register_event_callbacks(gptimer, &cbs, queue));\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(gptimer_enable(gptimer));\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(gptimer_start(gptimer));\\n\\nDynamic Alarm Update\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nAlarm value can be updated dynamically inside the ISR handler callback, by changing :cpp:member:`gptimer_alarm_event_data_t::alarm_value`.

The supported events are listed in the :cpp:type:`gptimer_etm_event_type_t`. You can call :cpp:func:`gptimer_new_etm_event` to get the corresponding ETM event handle. Likewise, GPTimer exposes several tasks that can be triggered by other ETM events. The supported tasks are listed in the :cpp:type:`gptimer_etm_task_type_t`. You can call :cpp:func:`gptimer_new_etm_task` to get the corresponding ETM task handle.\\n\\n    For how to connect the event and task to an ETM channel, please refer to the :doc:`ETM </api-reference/peripherals/etm>` documentation.\\n\\n    .. _gptimer-power-management:\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_ETM_SUPPORTED or not SOC_TIMER_SUPPORT_ETM\\n\\n    .. _gptimer-power-management:\\n\\nPower Management\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThere are some power management strategies, which might turn off or change the frequency of GPTimer\\'s source clock to save power consumption. For example, during DFS, APB clock will be scaled down. If light-sleep is also enabled, PLL and XTAL clocks will be powered off. Both of them can result in an inaccurate time keeping.\\n\\nThe driver can prevent the above situation from happening by creating different power management lock according to different clock source. The driver increases the reference count of that power management lock in the :cpp:func:`gptimer_enable` and decrease it in the :cpp:func:`gptimer_disable`. So we can ensure the clock source is stable between :cpp:func:`gptimer_enable` and :cpp:func:`gptimer_disable`.\\n\\n.. _gptimer-iram-safe:\\n\\nIRAM Safe\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy default, the GPTimer interrupt will be deferred when the cache is disabled because of writing or erasing the flash. Thus the alarm interrupt will not get executed in time, which is not expected in a real-time application.\\n\\nThere is a Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_GPTIMER_ISR_IRAM_SAFE` that:\\n\\n-  Enables the interrupt being serviced even when the cache is disabled\\n-  Places all functions that used by the ISR into IRAM [2]_\\n-  Places driver object into DRAM (in case it is mapped to PSRAM by accident)\\n\\nThis allows the interrupt to run while the cache is disabled, but comes at the cost of increased IRAM consumption.\\n\\nThere is another Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_GPTIMER_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM` that can put commonly used IO control functions into IRAM as well. So, these functions can also be executable when the cache is disabled. These IO control functions are as follows:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`gptimer_start`\\n- :cpp:func:`gptimer_stop`\\n- :cpp:func:`gptimer_get_raw_count`\\n- :cpp:func:`gptimer_set_raw_count`\\n- :cpp:func:`gptimer_set_alarm_action`\\n\\n.. _gptimer-thread-safety:\\n\\nThread Safety\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAll the APIs provided by the driver are guaranteed to be thread safe, which means you can call them from different RTOS tasks without protection by extra locks.

The first set is usually occupied by the SPI0 bus, which is responsible for the SPI flash holding the code to run. This means the SDIO slave driver can only run on the second set of pins while the SDIO host is not using it.\\n\\nThe SDIO slave can run under three modes: SPI, 1-bit SD, and 4-bit SD modes. Based on the signals on the interface, the device can determine the current mode and configure itself to adapt to that mode. Later, the slave driver can communicate with the slave device to properly handle commands and data transfers. According to the SDIO specification, the CMD and DAT0-3 signal lines should be pulled up whether in 1-bit SD, 4-bit SD or SPI mode.\\n\\nConnections\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    .. list-table::\\n        :header-rows: 1\\n        :widths: 25 25 25 25\\n        :align: center\\n\\n        * - Pin Name\\n          - Corresponding Pins in SPI Mode\\n          - GPIO Number (Slot 1)\\n          - GPIO Number (Slot 2)\\n        * - CLK\\n          - SCLK\\n          - 6\\n          - 14\\n        * - CMD\\n          - MOSI\\n          - 11\\n          - 15\\n        * - DAT0\\n          - MISO\\n          - 7\\n          - 2\\n        * - DAT1\\n          - Interrupt\\n          - 8\\n          - 4\\n        * - DAT2\\n          - N.C.

Most official modules do not offer these pullups internally. If you are using official development boards, check :ref:`compatibility_overview_espressif_hw_sdio` to see whether your development boards have such pullups.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n      Most official modules have conflicts on strapping pins with the SDIO slave function. If you are using an ESP32 module with 3.3 V flash inside, when you are developing on the module for the first time, you will need to perform an eFuse burn-in prior to development. This will adjust the pin configuration of the module to make the module compatible with SDIO functionality. See :ref:`compatibility_overview_espressif_hw_sdio` for details on how to configure this.\\n\\n        Here is a list of modules/kits with 3.3 V flash:\\n\\n        - Modules: All modules except ESP32-WROVER, ESP32-WROVER-I, ESP32-S3-WROOM-2, and please check `Modules Overview <https://www.espressif.com/en/products/modules>`__ for module list\\n        - Kits: ESP32-PICO-KIT, ESP32-DevKitC (up to v4), ESP32-WROVER-KIT (v4.1 [also known as ESP32-WROVER-KIT-VB], v2, v1 [also known as DevKitJ v1])\\n\\n        You can tell the version of your ESP23-WROVER-KIT version from the module on it: v4.1 are with ESP32-WROVER-B modules, v3 are with ESP32-WROVER modules, while v2 and v1 are with ESP32-WROOM-32 modules.\\n\\nRefer to :doc:`sd_pullup_requirements` for more technical details of the pullups.\\n\\n.. toctree::\\n    :hidden:\\n\\n    sd_pullup_requirements\\n\\nThe host initializes the slave into SD mode by sending the CMD0 command with the DAT3 pin set to a high level. Alternatively, the host initializes the SPI mode by sending CMD0 with CS pin low, which is the same pin as DAT3.\\n\\nAfter the initialization, the host can enable the 4-bit SD mode by writing CCCR register 0x07 by CMD52. All the bus detection processes are handled by the slave peripheral.\\n\\nThe host has to communicate with the slave by an ESP-slave-specific protocol.\\n\\nThe slave driver offers three services over Function 1 access by CMD52 and CMD53:\\n\\n(1) sending and receiving FIFO\\n(2) 52 R/W registers (8-bit) shared by host and slave\\n(3) 16 interrupt sources (8 from host to slave, and 8 from slave to host)\\n\\nTerminology\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe SDIO slave driver uses the following terms:\\n\\n- A transfer is initiated by a command token from the host and may consist of a response and multiple data blocks. The core mechanism of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} SDIO slave driver involves data exchange and communication through transfers.\\n- Sending: slave to host transfers.\\n- Receiving: host to slave transfers.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  The register names in **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **SDIO Slave Controller** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#sdioslave>`__] are organized from the host\\'s perspective. For instance, ``RX`` registers indicate sending, while ``TX`` registers denote receiving. In our driver implementation, we\\'ve chosen not to utilize the terms ``TX`` or ``RX`` to prevent any potential ambiguities.\\n\\n- FIFO: A designated address within Function 1 that can be accessed using CMD53 commands for reading or writing substantial volumes of data. The address corresponds to the length intended for reading from or writing to the slave in a single transfer: **requested length** = 0x1F800 – address.\\n- Ownership: When the driver assumes ownership of a buffer, it means that the driver has the capability to perform random read/write operations on the buffer (often via DMA). The application should not read/write the buffer until the ownership is returned to the application. If the application reads from a buffer owned by a receiving driver, the data read can be random; similarly, if the application writes to a buffer owned by a sending driver, the data sent may be corrupted.\\n- Requested length: The length requested in one transfer determined by the FIFO address.\\n- Transfer length: The length requested in one transfer determined by the CMD53 byte/block count field.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  Requested length is different from the transfer length. In the context of {IDF_TARGET_NAME} SDIO slave DMA, the operation is based on the **requested length** rather than the **transfer length**. This means the DMA controller will process the data transfer according to the **requested length**, ensuring that only data within the **requested length** is transferred. The **transfer length** should be no shorter than the **requested length**, and the rest part is filled with 0 during sending or discard during receiving.\\n\\n- Receiving buffer size: The buffer size is pre-defined between the host and the slave before communication starts. The slave application has to set the buffer size during initialization by the ``recv_buffer_size`` parameter in the ``sdio_slave_config_t`` structure.\\n- Interrupts: The {IDF_TARGET_NAME} SDIO slave supports interrupts in two directions: from host to slave (referred to as slave interrupts) and from slave to host (referred to as host interrupts). For more details, refer to :ref:`interrupts`.\\n- Registers: Specific addresses in Function 1 accessed by CMD52 or CMD53.\\n\\nCommunication with ESP SDIO Slave\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe host should initialize the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} SDIO slave according to the standard SDIO initialization process (Sector 3.1.2 of `SDIO Simplified Specification <https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/pls/pdf/?p=PartE1_SDIO_Simplified_Specification_Ver3.00.jpg&f=PartE1_SDIO_Simplified_Specification_Ver3.00.pdf&e=EN_SSE1>`_), which is described briefly in :ref:`esp_slave_init`.\\n\\nFurthermore, there is an {IDF_TARGET_NAME}-specific upper-level communication protocol built upon the foundation of CMD52/CMD53 to Function 1. Within this particular communication protocol, the master and slave engage in data exchange and communication through the utilization of CMD52/CMD53 commands. For more detailed information, please consult the :ref:`esp_slave_protocol_layer` section.\\n\\nThere is also a component :doc:`/api-reference/protocols/esp_serial_slave_link` designed for {IDF_TARGET_NAME} master to communicate with {IDF_TARGET_NAME} SDIO slave. See example :example:`peripherals/sdio` when programming your host.\\n\\n\\n.. _interrupts:\\n\\nInterrupts\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThere are interrupts from host to slave, and from slave to host to help communicating conveniently.\\n\\nSlave Interrupts\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nThe host can trigger an interruption in the slave by writing a single bit to the 0x08D register. As soon as any bit within the register is set, an interrupt is generated, prompting the SDIO slave driver to invoke the callback function specified in the ``slave_intr_cb`` member of the ``sdio_slave_config_t`` structure.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  The callback function is called in the ISR. Do not use any delay, loop or blocking function in the callback, e.g., mutex.\\n\\nSimilar to the previous information, there\\'s an alternative set of functions available. You can call ``sdio_slave_wait_int`` to wait for an interrupt within a certain time, or call ``sdio_slave_clear_int`` to clear interrupts from host. The callback function can work with the wait functions perfectly.\\n\\nHost Interrupts\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nThe slave can interrupt the host by an interrupt line at certain time, which is level-sensitive, i.e., the interrupt signal can be triggered by detecting the level change of the interrupt line. When the host see the interrupt line pulled down, it may read the slave interrupt status register, to see the interrupt source. Host can clear interrupt bits, or choose to disable a interrupt source. The interrupt line holds active until all the sources are cleared or disabled.\\n\\nThere are several dedicated interrupt sources as well as general-purpose sources. see ``sdio_slave_hostint_t`` for more information.\\n\\nShared Registers\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThere are 52 R/W shared registers (8-bit) to share information between host and slave. The slave can write or read the registers at any time by ``sdio_slave_read_reg`` and ``sdio_slave_write_reg``. The host can access (R/W) the register by CMD52 or CMD53.\\n\\nReceiving FIFO\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen the host is going to send the slave some packets, it has to check whether the slave is ready to receive by reading the buffer number of slave.\\n\\nTo allow the host sending data to the slave, the application has to load buffers to the slave driver by the following steps:\\n\\n1. Register the buffer by calling ``sdio_slave_recv_register_buf``, and get the handle of the registered buffer. The driver allocates memory for the linked-list descriptor needed to link the buffer onto the hardware. The size of these buffers should equal to the Receiving buffer size.\\n2. Load buffers onto the driver by passing the buffer handle to ``sdio_slave_recv_load_buf``.\\n3. Get the received data by calling ``sdio_slave_recv`` or ``sdio_slave_recv_packet``. If a non-blocking call is needed, set ``wait=0``.\\n\\n   The difference between two APIs is that, ``sdio_slave_recv_packet`` gives more information about packet, which can consist of several buffers.\\n\\n   When ``ESP_ERR_NOT_FINISHED`` is returned by this API, you should call this API iteratively until the return value is ``ESP_OK``. All the continuous buffers returned with ``ESP_ERR_NOT_FINISHED``, together with the last buffer returned with ``ESP_OK``, belong to one packet from the host.\\n\\n   Call ``sdio_slave_recv_get_buf`` to get the address of the received data, and the actual length received in each buffer. The packet length is the sum of received length of all the buffers in the packet.\\n\\n   If the host never send data longer than the Receiving buffer size, or you do not care about the packet boundary (e.g., the data is only a byte stream), you can call the simpler version ``sdio_slave_recv`` instead.\\n\\n4. Pass the handle of processed buffer back to the driver by ``sdio_recv_load_buf`` again.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  To minimize data copying overhead, the driver itself does not maintain any internal buffer; it is the responsibility of the application to promptly provide new buffers. The DMA system automatically stores received data into these buffers.\\n\\nSending FIFO\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nEach time the slave has data to send, it raises an interrupt, and the host requests the packet length. There are two sending modes:\\n\\n- Stream Mode: When a buffer is loaded into the driver, the buffer length is included into the packet length requested by host in the incoming communications. This is irrespective of whether previous packets have been sent or not. In other words, the length of the newly loaded buffer is included into the length of the packet requested by the host, even if there are previously unsent packets. This enables the host to receive data from several buffers in a single transfer.\\n- Packet Mode: The packet length is updated packet by packet, and only when previous packet is sent. This means that the host can only get data of one buffer in one transfer.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  To avoid overhead from copying data, the driver itself does not have any buffer inside. Namely, the DMA takes data directly from the buffer provided by the application. The application should not touch the buffer until the sending is finished, so as to ensure that the data is transferred correctly.\\n\\nThe sending mode can be set in the ``sending_mode`` member of ``sdio_slave_config_t``, and the buffer numbers can be set in the ``send_queue_size``. All the buffers are restricted to be no larger than 4092 bytes. Though in the stream mode, several buffers can be sent in one transfer, each buffer is still counted as one in the queue.\\n\\nThe application can call ``sdio_slave_transmit`` to send packets. In this case, the function returns when the transfer is successfully done, so the queue is not fully used. When higher efficiency is required, the application can use the following functions instead:\\n\\n1. Pass buffer information (address, length, as well as an ``arg`` indicating the buffer) to ``sdio_slave_send_queue``.\\n\\n   - If non-blocking call is needed, set ``wait=0``.\\n   - If the ``wait`` is not ``portMAX_DELAY`` (wait until success), application has to check the result to know whether the data is put in to the queue or discard.\\n\\n2. Call ``sdio_slave_send_get_finished`` to get and deal with a finished transfer. A buffer should be kept unmodified until returned from ``sdio_slave_send_get_finished``. This means the buffer is actually sent to the host, rather than just staying in the queue.\\n\\nThere are several ways to use the ``arg`` in the queue parameter:\\n\\n    1. Directly point ``arg`` to a dynamic-allocated buffer, and use the ``arg`` to free it when transfer finished.\\n    2. Wrap transfer informations in a transfer structure, and point ``arg`` to the structure. You can use the structure to do more things like::\\n\\n          typedef struct {\\n              uint8_t* buffer;\\n              size_t   size;\\n              int      id;\\n          }sdio_transfer_t;\\n\\n          //and send as:\\n          sdio_transfer_t trans = {\\n              .buffer = ADDRESS_TO_SEND,\\n              .size = 8,\\n              .id = 3,  //the 3rd transfer so far\\n          };\\n          sdio_slave_send_queue(trans.buffer, trans.size, &trans, portMAX_DELAY);\\n\\n          //... maybe more transfers are sent here\\n\\n          //and deal with finished transfer as:\\n          sdio_transfer_t* arg = NULL;\\n          sdio_slave_send_get_finished((void**)&arg, portMAX_DELAY);\\n          ESP_LOGI(\"tag\", \"(%d) successfully send %d bytes of %p\", arg->id, arg->size, arg->buffer);\\n          some_post_callback(arg); //do more things\\n\\n    3. Work with the receiving part of this driver, and point ``arg`` to the receive buffer handle of this buffer, so that we can directly use the buffer to receive data when it is sent::\\n\\n           uint8_t buffer[256]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8};\\n           sdio_slave_buf_handle_t handle = sdio_slave_recv_register_buf(buffer);\\n           sdio_slave_send_queue(buffer, 8, handle, portMAX_DELAY);\\n\\n           //... maybe more transfers are sent here\\n\\n           //and load finished buffer to receive as\\n           sdio_slave_buf_handle_t handle = NULL;\\n           sdio_slave_send_get_finished((void**)&handle, portMAX_DELAY);\\n           sdio_slave_recv_load_buf(handle);\\n\\n       For more about this, see :example:`peripherals/sdio`.\\n\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\nSlave/master communication: :example:`peripherals/sdio`.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/sdio_slave_types.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/sdio_slave.inc\\n',\n",

An SPI bus may be connected to one or more Devices. Each Device shares the MOSI, MISO, and SCLK signals but is only active on the bus when the Host asserts the Device\\'s individual CS line.\\n   * - Bus\\n     - A signal bus, common to all Devices connected to one Host. In general, a bus includes the following lines: MISO, MOSI, SCLK, one or more CS lines, and, optionally, QUADWP and QUADHD. So Devices are connected to the same lines, with the exception that each Device has its own CS line. Several Devices can also share one CS line if connected in a daisy-chain manner.\\n   * - MOSI\\n     - Master Out, Slave In, a.k.a. D. Data transmission from a Host to Device.

The driver supports the following features:\\n\\n- Multi-threaded environments\\n- Transparent handling of DMA transfers while reading and writing data\\n- Automatic time-division multiplexing of data coming from different Devices on the same signal bus, see :ref:`spi_bus_lock`.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    The SPI Master driver allows multiple Devices to be connected on a same SPI bus (sharing a single {IDF_TARGET_NAME} SPI peripheral). As long as each Device is accessed by only one task, the driver is thread-safe. However, if multiple tasks try to access the same SPI Device, the driver is **not thread-safe**. In this case, it is recommended to either:\\n\\n    - Refactor your application so that each SPI peripheral is only accessed by a single task at a time. You can use :cpp:member:`spi_bus_config_t::isr_cpu_id` to register the SPI ISR to the same core as SPI peripheral-related tasks to ensure thread safety.\\n    - Add a mutex lock around the shared Device using :c:macro:`xSemaphoreCreateMutex`.\\n\\n.. toctree::\\n   :hidden:\\n\\n   SPI Features <spi_features>\\n\\nSPI Transactions\\n----------------\\n\\nAn SPI bus transaction consists of five phases which can be found in the table below. Any of these phases can be skipped.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_ADDR_LEN:default=\"32\", esp32=\"64\"}\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n   :widths: 30 70\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n\\n   * - Phase\\n     - Description\\n   * - Command\\n     - In this phase, a command (0-16 bit) is written to the bus by the Host.\\n   * - Address\\n     - In this phase, an address (0-{IDF_TARGET_ADDR_LEN} bit) is transmitted over the bus by the Host.\\n   * - Dummy\\n     - This phase is configurable and is used to meet the timing requirements.\\n   * - Write\\n     - Host sends data to a Device. This data follows the optional command and address phases and is indistinguishable from them at the electrical level.\\n   * - Read\\n     - Device sends data to its Host.\\n\\n.. todo::\\n\\n   Add a package diagram.\\n\\n\\nThe attributes of a transaction are determined by the bus configuration structure :cpp:type:`spi_bus_config_t`, Device configuration structure :cpp:type:`spi_device_interface_config_t`, and transaction configuration structure :cpp:type:`spi_transaction_t`.\\n\\nAn SPI Host can send full-duplex transactions, during which the Read and Write phases occur simultaneously. The total transaction length is determined by the sum of the following members:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`spi_device_interface_config_t::command_bits`\\n- :cpp:member:`spi_device_interface_config_t::address_bits`\\n- :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::length`\\n\\nWhile the member :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::rxlength` only determines the length of data received into the buffer.\\n\\nIn half-duplex transactions, the Read and Write phases are not simultaneous (one direction at a time). The lengths of the Write and Read phases are determined by :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::length` and :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::rxlength` respectively.\\n\\nThe Command and Address phases are optional, as not every SPI Device requires a command and/or address. This is reflected in the Device\\'s configuration: if :cpp:member:`spi_device_interface_config_t::command_bits` and/or :cpp:member:`spi_device_interface_config_t::address_bits` are set to zero, no Command or Address phase will occur.\\n\\nThe Read and Write phases can also be optional, as not every transaction requires both writing and reading data. If :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::rx_buffer` is ``NULL`` and :c:macro:`SPI_TRANS_USE_RXDATA` is not set, the Read phase is skipped. If :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::tx_buffer` is ``NULL`` and :c:macro:`SPI_TRANS_USE_TXDATA` is not set, the Write phase is skipped.\\n\\nThe driver supports two types of transactions: interrupt transactions and polling transactions. The programmer can choose to use a different transaction type per Device. If your Device requires both transaction types, see :ref:`mixed_transactions`.\\n\\n\\n.. _interrupt_transactions:\\n\\nInterrupt Transactions\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nInterrupt transactions blocks the transaction routine until the transaction completes, thus allowing the CPU to run other tasks.\\n\\nAn application task can queue multiple transactions, and the driver automatically handles them one by one in the interrupt service routine (ISR). It allows the task to switch to other procedures until all the transactions are complete.\\n\\n\\n.. _polling_transactions:\\n\\nPolling Transactions\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nPolling transactions do not use interrupts. The routine keeps polling the SPI Host\\'s status bit until the transaction is finished.\\n\\nAll the tasks that use interrupt transactions can be blocked by the queue. At this point, they need to wait for the ISR to run twice before the transaction is finished. Polling transactions save time otherwise spent on queue handling and context switching, which results in smaller transaction duration. The disadvantage is that the CPU is busy while these transactions are in progress.\\n\\nThe :cpp:func:`spi_device_polling_end` routine needs an overhead of at least 1 µs to unblock other tasks when the transaction is finished. It is strongly recommended to wrap a series of polling transactions using the functions :cpp:func:`spi_device_acquire_bus` and :cpp:func:`spi_device_release_bus` to avoid the overhead. For more information, see :ref:`bus_acquiring`.\\n\\n.. _transaction-line-mode:\\n\\nTransaction Line Mode\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSupported line modes for {IDF_TARGET_NAME} are listed as follows, to make use of these modes, set the member ``flags`` in the struct :cpp:type:`spi_transaction_t` as shown in the ``Transaction Flag`` column. If you want to check if corresponding IO pins are set or not, set the member ``flags`` in the :cpp:type:`spi_bus_config_t` as shown in the ``Bus IO setting Flag`` column.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_SPI_SUPPORT_OCT\\n\\n    .. list-table::\\n       :widths: 30 40 40 40 50 50\\n       :header-rows: 1\\n\\n       * - Mode name\\n         - Command Line Width\\n         - Address Line Width\\n         - Data Line Width\\n         - Transaction Flag\\n         - Bus IO Setting Flag\\n       * - Normal SPI\\n         - 1\\n         - 1\\n         - 1\\n         - 0\\n         - 0\\n       * - Dual Output\\n         - 1\\n         - 1\\n         - 2\\n         - SPI_TRANS_MODE_DIO\\n         - SPICOMMON_BUSFLAG_DUAL\\n       * - Dual I/O\\n         - 1\\n         - 2\\n         - 2\\n         - SPI_TRANS_MODE_DIO\\n           SPI_TRANS_MULTILINE_ADDR\\n         - SPICOMMON_BUSFLAG_DUAL\\n       * - Quad Output\\n         - 1\\n         - 1\\n         - 4\\n         - SPI_TRANS_MODE_QIO\\n         - SPICOMMON_BUSFLAG_QUAD\\n       * - Quad I/O\\n         - 1\\n         - 4\\n         - 4\\n         - SPI_TRANS_MODE_QIO\\n           SPI_TRANS_MULTILINE_ADDR\\n         - SPICOMMON_BUSFLAG_QUAD\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPI_SUPPORT_OCT\\n\\n    .. list-table::\\n       :widths: 30 40 40 40 50 50\\n       :header-rows: 1\\n\\n       * - Mode name\\n         - Command Line Width\\n         - Address Line Width\\n         - Data Line Width\\n         - Transaction Flag\\n         - Bus IO Setting Flag\\n       * - Normal SPI\\n         - 1\\n         - 1\\n         - 1\\n         - 0\\n         - 0\\n       * - Dual Output\\n         - 1\\n         - 1\\n         - 2\\n         - SPI_TRANS_MODE_DIO\\n         - SPICOMMON_BUSFLAG_DUAL\\n       * - Dual I/O\\n         - 1\\n         - 2\\n         - 2\\n         - SPI_TRANS_MODE_DIO\\n           SPI_TRANS_MULTILINE_ADDR\\n         - SPICOMMON_BUSFLAG_DUAL\\n       * - Quad Output\\n         - 1\\n         - 1\\n         - 4\\n         - SPI_TRANS_MODE_QIO\\n         - SPICOMMON_BUSFLAG_QUAD\\n       * - Quad I/O\\n         - 1\\n         - 4\\n         - 4\\n         - SPI_TRANS_MODE_QIO\\n           SPI_TRANS_MULTILINE_ADDR\\n         - SPICOMMON_BUSFLAG_QUAD\\n       * - Octal Output\\n         - 1\\n         - 1\\n         - 8\\n         - SPI_TRANS_MODE_OCT\\n         - SPICOMMON_BUSFLAG_OCTAL\\n       * - OPI\\n         - 8\\n         - 8\\n         - 8\\n         - SPI_TRANS_MODE_OCT\\n           SPI_TRANS_MULTILINE_ADDR\\n           SPI_TRANS_MULTILINE_CMD\\n         - SPICOMMON_BUSFLAG_OCTAL\\n\\nCommand and Address Phases\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nDuring the Command and Address phases, the members :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::cmd` and :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::addr` are sent to the bus, nothing is read at this time. The default lengths of the Command and Address phases are set in :cpp:type:`spi_device_interface_config_t` by calling :cpp:func:`spi_bus_add_device`. If the flags :c:macro:`SPI_TRANS_VARIABLE_CMD` and :c:macro:`SPI_TRANS_VARIABLE_ADDR` in the member :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::flags` are not set, the driver automatically sets the length of these phases to default values during Device initialization.\\n\\nIf the lengths of the Command and Address phases need to be variable, declare the struct :cpp:type:`spi_transaction_ext_t`, set the flags :c:macro:`SPI_TRANS_VARIABLE_CMD` and/or :c:macro:`SPI_TRANS_VARIABLE_ADDR` in the member :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_ext_t::base` and configure the rest of base as usual. Then the length of each phase will be equal to :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_ext_t::command_bits` and :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_ext_t::address_bits` set in the struct :cpp:type:`spi_transaction_ext_t`.\\n\\nIf the Command and Address phase need to have the same number of lines as the data phase, you need to set ``SPI_TRANS_MULTILINE_CMD`` and/or ``SPI_TRANS_MULTILINE_ADDR`` to the ``flags`` member in the struct :cpp:type:`spi_transaction_t`. Also see :ref:`transaction-line-mode`.\\n\\n\\nWrite and Read Phases\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nNormally, the data that needs to be transferred to or from a Device is read from or written to a chunk of memory indicated by the members :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::rx_buffer` and :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::tx_buffer`. If DMA is enabled for transfers, the buffers are required to be:\\n\\n  1. Allocated in DMA-capable internal memory (MALLOC_CAP_DMA), see :ref:`DMA-Capable Memory <dma-capable-memory>`.\\n  2. 32-bit aligned (starting from a 32-bit boundary and having a length of multiples of 4 bytes).\\n\\nIf these requirements are not satisfied, the transaction efficiency will be affected due to the allocation and copying of temporary buffers.\\n\\nIf using more than one data line to transmit, please set ``SPI_DEVICE_HALFDUPLEX`` flag for the member ``flags`` in the struct :cpp:type:`spi_device_interface_config_t`. And the member ``flags`` in the struct :cpp:type:`spi_transaction_t` should be set as described in :ref:`transaction-line-mode`.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Half-duplex transactions with both Read and Write phases are not supported when using DMA. For details and workarounds, see :ref:`spi_known_issues`.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_SPI_HD_BOTH_INOUT_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Half-duplex transactions with both Read and Write phases are not supported. Please use full duplex mode.\\n\\n.. _bus_acquiring:\\n\\nBus Acquiring\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSometimes you might want to send SPI transactions exclusively and continuously so that it takes as little time as possible. For this, you can use bus acquiring, which helps to suspend transactions (both polling or interrupt) to other Devices until the bus is released. To acquire and release a bus, use the functions :cpp:func:`spi_device_acquire_bus` and :cpp:func:`spi_device_release_bus`.\\n\\n\\nDriver Usage\\n------------\\n\\n.. todo::\\n\\n   Organize the Driver Usage into subsections that will reflect the general user experience of the users, e.g.,\\n\\n   Configuration\\n\\n   Add stuff about the configuration API here, the various options in configuration (e.g., configure for interrupt vs. polling), and optional configuration\\n\\n   Transactions\\n\\n   Describe how to execute a normal transaction (i.e., where data is larger than 32 bits). Describe how to configure between big and little-endian.\\n\\n   - Add a sub-sub section on how to optimize when transmitting less than 32 bits\\n   - Add a sub-sub section on how to transmit mixed transactions to the same Device\\n\\n\\n- Initialize an SPI bus by calling the function :cpp:func:`spi_bus_initialize`. Make sure to set the correct I/O pins in the struct :cpp:type:`spi_bus_config_t`. Set the signals that are not needed to ``-1``.\\n\\n- Register a Device connected to the bus with the driver by calling the function :cpp:func:`spi_bus_add_device`. Make sure to configure any timing requirements the Device might need with the parameter ``dev_config``. You should now have obtained the Device\\'s handle which will be used when sending a transaction to it.\\n\\n- To interact with the Device, fill one or more :cpp:type:`spi_transaction_t` structs with any transaction parameters required. Then send the structs either using a polling transaction or an interrupt transaction:\\n\\n    - :ref:`Interrupt <interrupt_transactions>`\\n        Either queue all transactions by calling the function :cpp:func:`spi_device_queue_trans` and, at a later time, query the result using the function :cpp:func:`spi_device_get_trans_result`, or handle all requests synchronously by feeding them into :cpp:func:`spi_device_transmit`.\\n\\n    - :ref:`Polling <polling_transactions>`\\n        Call the function :cpp:func:`spi_device_polling_transmit` to send polling transactions. Alternatively, if you want to insert something in between, send the transactions by using :cpp:func:`spi_device_polling_start` and :cpp:func:`spi_device_polling_end`.\\n\\n- (Optional) To perform back-to-back transactions with a Device, call the function :cpp:func:`spi_device_acquire_bus` before sending transactions and :cpp:func:`spi_device_release_bus` after the transactions have been sent.\\n\\n- (Optional) To remove a certain Device from the bus, call :cpp:func:`spi_bus_remove_device` with the Device handle as an argument.\\n\\n- (Optional) To remove the driver from the bus, make sure no more devices are attached and call :cpp:func:`spi_bus_free`.\\n\\nThe example code for the SPI Master driver can be found in the :example:`peripherals/spi_master` directory of ESP-IDF examples.\\n\\n\\nTransactions with Data Not Exceeding 32 Bits\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen the transaction data size is equal to or less than 32 bits, it will be sub-optimal to allocate a buffer for the data. The data can be directly stored in the transaction struct instead. For transmitted data, it can be achieved by using the :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::tx_data` member and setting the :c:macro:`SPI_TRANS_USE_TXDATA` flag on the transmission. For received data, use :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::rx_data` and set :c:macro:`SPI_TRANS_USE_RXDATA`. In both cases, do not touch the :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::tx_buffer` or :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::rx_buffer` members, because they use the same memory locations as :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::tx_data` and :cpp:member:`spi_transaction_t::rx_data`.\\n\\n\\nTransactions with Integers Other than ``uint8_t``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAn SPI Host reads and writes data into memory byte by byte. By default, data is sent with the most significant bit (MSB) first, as LSB is first used in rare cases. If a value of fewer than 8 bits needs to be sent, the bits should be written into memory in the MSB first manner.\\n\\nFor example, if ``0b00010`` needs to be sent, it should be written into a ``uint8_t`` variable, and the length for reading should be set to 5 bits. The Device will still receive 8 bits with 3 additional \"random\" bits, so the reading must be performed correctly.\\n\\nOn top of that, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is a little-endian chip, which means that the least significant byte of ``uint16_t`` and ``uint32_t`` variables is stored at the smallest address. Hence, if ``uint16_t`` is stored in memory, bits [7:0] are sent first, followed by bits [15:8].\\n\\nFor cases when the data to be transmitted has a size differing from ``uint8_t`` arrays, the following macros can be used to transform data to the format that can be sent by the SPI driver directly:\\n\\n- :c:macro:`SPI_SWAP_DATA_TX` for data to be transmitted\\n- :c:macro:`SPI_SWAP_DATA_RX` for data received\\n\\n\\n.. _mixed_transactions:\\n\\nNotes on Sending Mixed Transactions to the Same Device\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTo reduce coding complexity, send only one type of transaction (interrupt or polling) to one Device. However, you still can send both interrupt and polling transactions alternately. The notes below explain how to do this.\\n\\nThe polling transactions should be initiated only after all the polling and interrupt transactions are finished.\\n\\nSince an unfinished polling transaction blocks other transactions, please do not forget to call the function :cpp:func:`spi_device_polling_end` after :cpp:func:`spi_device_polling_start` to allow other transactions or to allow other Devices to use the bus. Remember that if there is no need to switch to other tasks during your polling transaction, you can initiate a transaction with :cpp:func:`spi_device_polling_transmit` so that it will be ended automatically.\\n\\nIn-flight polling transactions are disturbed by the ISR operation to accommodate interrupt transactions. Always make sure that all the interrupt transactions sent to the ISR are finished before you call :cpp:func:`spi_device_polling_start`. To do that, you can keep calling :cpp:func:`spi_device_get_trans_result` until all the transactions are returned.\\n\\nTo have better control of the calling sequence of functions, send mixed transactions to the same Device only within a single task.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    .. _spi_master_on_spi1_bus:\\n\\n    Notes on Using the SPI Master Driver on SPI1 Bus\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Though the :ref:`spi_bus_lock` feature makes it possible to use SPI Master driver on the SPI1 bus, it is still tricky and needs a lot of special treatment. It is a feature for advanced developers.\\n\\n    To use SPI Master driver on SPI1 bus, you have to take care of two problems:\\n\\n    1. The code and data should be in the internal memory when the driver is operating on SPI1 bus.\\n\\n       SPI1 bus is shared among Devices and the cache for data (code) in the flash as well as the PSRAM. The cache should be disabled when other drivers are operating on the SPI1 bus. Hence the data (code) in the flash as well as the PSRAM cannot be fetched while the driver acquires the SPI1 bus by:\\n\\n       - Explicit bus acquiring between :cpp:func:`spi_device_acquire_bus` and :cpp:func:`spi_device_release_bus`.\\n       - Implicit bus acquiring between :cpp:func:`spi_device_polling_start` and :cpp:func:`spi_device_polling_end` (or inside :cpp:func:`spi_device_polling_transmit`).\\n\\n       During the time above, all other tasks and most ISRs will be disabled (see :ref:`iram-safe-interrupt-handlers`). Application code and data used by the current task should be placed in internal memory (DRAM or IRAM), or already in the ROM. Access to external memory (flash code, const data in the flash, and static/heap data in the PSRAM) will cause a ``Cache disabled but cached memory region accessed`` exception. For differences between IRAM, DRAM, and flash cache, please refer to the :ref:`application memory layout <memory-layout>` documentation.\\n\\n       To place functions into the IRAM, you can either:\\n\\n       1. Add ``IRAM_ATTR`` (include ``esp_attr.h``) to the function like:\\n\\n              IRAM_ATTR void foo(void) { }\\n\\n          Please note that when a function is inlined, it will follow its caller\\'s segment, and the attribute will not take effect. You may need to use ``NOLINE_ATTR`` to avoid this. Please also note that the compiler may transform some code into a lookup table in the const data, so ``noflash_text`` is not safe.\\n\\n       2. Use the ``noflash`` placement in the ``linker.lf``. See more in :doc:`../../api-guides/linker-script-generation`. Please note that the compiler may transform some code into a lookup table in the const data, so ``noflash_text`` is not safe.\\n\\n       Please do take care that the optimization level may affect the compiler behavior of inline, or transform some code into a lookup table in the const data, etc.\\n\\n       To place data into the DRAM, you can either:\\n\\n       1. Add ``DRAM_ATTR`` (include ``esp_attr.h``) to the data definition like:\\n\\n              DRAM_ATTR int g_foo = 3;\\n\\n       2. Use the ``noflash`` placement in the linker.lf. See more in :doc:`../../api-guides/linker-script-generation`.\\n\\n    Please also see the example :example:`peripherals/spi_master/hd_eeprom`.\\n\\n\\nGPIO Matrix and IO_MUX\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    Most of ESP32\\'s peripheral signals have a direct connection to their dedicated IO_MUX pins.

For multiple small transactions, the transfer speed is mostly determined by the length of transaction intervals.\\n\\n\\nTransaction Duration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_TRANS_TIME_INTR_DMA:default=\"N/A\", esp32=\"28\", esp32s2=\"23\", esp32c3=\"28\", esp32s3=\"26\", esp32c2=\"42\", esp32c6=\"34\", esp32h2=\"58\", esp32c5=\"27\"}\\n{IDF_TARGET_TRANS_TIME_POLL_DMA:default=\"N/A\", esp32=\"10\", esp32s2=\"9\",  esp32c3=\"10\", esp32s3=\"11\", esp32c2=\"17\", esp32c6=\"17\", esp32h2=\"28\", esp32c5=\"16\"}\\n{IDF_TARGET_TRANS_TIME_INTR_CPU:default=\"N/A\", esp32=\"25\", esp32s2=\"22\", esp32c3=\"27\", esp32s3=\"24\", esp32c2=\"40\", esp32c6=\"32\", esp32h2=\"54\", esp32c5=\"24\"}\\n{IDF_TARGET_TRANS_TIME_POLL_CPU:default=\"N/A\", esp32=\"8\",  esp32s2=\"8\",  esp32c3=\"9\",  esp32s3=\"9\",  esp32c2=\"15\", esp32c6=\"15\", esp32h2=\"24\", esp32c5=\"13\"}\\n\\nTransaction duration includes setting up SPI peripheral registers, copying data to FIFOs or setting up DMA links, and the time for SPI transactions.\\n\\nInterrupt transactions allow appending extra overhead to accommodate the cost of FreeRTOS queues and the time needed for switching between tasks and the ISR.\\n\\nFor **interrupt transactions**, the CPU can switch to other tasks when a transaction is in progress. This saves CPU time but increases the transaction duration. See :ref:`interrupt_transactions`. For **polling transactions**, it does not block the task but allows to do polling when the transaction is in progress. For more information, see :ref:`polling_transactions`.\\n\\nIf DMA is enabled, setting up the linked list requires about 2 µs per transaction. When a master is transferring data, it automatically reads the data from the linked list. If DMA is not enabled, the CPU has to write and read each byte from the FIFO by itself. Usually, this is faster than 2 µs, but the transaction length is limited to 64 bytes for both write and read.\\n\\nThe typical transaction duration for one byte of data is given below.\\n\\n- Interrupt Transaction via DMA: {IDF_TARGET_TRANS_TIME_INTR_DMA} µs.\\n- Interrupt Transaction via CPU: {IDF_TARGET_TRANS_TIME_INTR_CPU} µs.\\n- Polling Transaction via DMA: {IDF_TARGET_TRANS_TIME_POLL_DMA} µs.\\n- Polling Transaction via CPU: {IDF_TARGET_TRANS_TIME_POLL_CPU} µs.\\n\\nNote that these data are tested with :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_ISR_IN_IRAM` enabled. SPI transaction related code are placed in the internal memory. If this option is turned off (for example, for internal memory optimization), the transaction duration may be affected.\\n\\nSPI Clock Frequency\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe clock source of the GPSPI peripherals can be selected by setting :cpp:member:`spi_device_handle_t::cfg::clock_source`. You can refer to :cpp:type:`spi_clock_source_t` to know the supported clock sources.\\n\\nBy default driver sets :cpp:member:`spi_device_handle_t::cfg::clock_source` to ``SPI_CLK_SRC_DEFAULT``. This usually stands for the highest frequency among GPSPI clock sources. Its value is different among chips.\\n\\nThe actual clock frequency of a Device may not be exactly equal to the number you set, it is re-calculated by the driver to the nearest hardware-compatible number, and not larger than the clock frequency of the clock source. You can call :cpp:func:`spi_device_get_actual_freq` to know the actual frequency computed by the driver.\\n\\nThe theoretical maximum transfer speed of the Write or Read phase can be calculated according to the table below:\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_SPI_SUPPORT_OCT\\n\\n    .. list-table::\\n       :widths: 40 30\\n       :header-rows: 1\\n\\n       * - Line Width of Write/Read phase\\n         - Speed (Bps)\\n       * - 1-Line\\n         - *SPI Frequency / 8*\\n       * - 2-Line\\n         - *SPI Frequency / 4*\\n       * - 4-Line\\n         - *SPI Frequency / 2*\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPI_SUPPORT_OCT\\n\\n    .. list-table::\\n       :widths: 40 30\\n       :header-rows: 1\\n\\n       * - Line Width of Write/Read phase\\n         - Speed (Bps)\\n       * - 1-Line\\n         - *SPI Frequency / 8*\\n       * - 2-Line\\n         - *SPI Frequency / 4*\\n       * - 4-Line\\n         - *SPI Frequency / 2*\\n       * - 8-Line\\n         - *SPI Frequency*\\n\\nThe transfer speed calculation of other phases (Command, Address, Dummy) is similar.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    If the clock frequency is too high, the use of some functions might be limited. See :ref:`timing_considerations`.\\n\\nCache Missing\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe default config puts only the ISR into the IRAM. Other SPI-related functions, including the driver itself and the callback, might suffer from cache misses and need to wait until the code is read from flash. Select :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_IN_IRAM` to put the whole SPI driver into IRAM and put the entire callback(s) and its callee functions into IRAM to prevent cache missing.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    SPI driver implementation is based on FreeRTOS APIs, to use :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_IN_IRAM`, you should not enable :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_PLACE_FUNCTIONS_INTO_FLASH`.\\n\\nFor an interrupt transaction, the overall cost is **20+8n/Fspi[MHz]** [µs] for n bytes transferred in one transaction. Hence, the transferring speed is: **n/(20+8n/Fspi)**. An example of transferring speed at 8 MHz clock speed is given in the following table.\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n   :widths: 30 45 40 30 30\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n\\n   * - Frequency (MHz)\\n     - Transaction Interval (µs)\\n     - Transaction Length (bytes)\\n     - Total Time (µs)\\n     - Total Speed (KBps)\\n   * - 8\\n     - 25\\n     - 1\\n     - 26\\n     - 38.5\\n   * - 8\\n     - 25\\n     - 8\\n     - 33\\n     - 242.4\\n   * - 8\\n     - 25\\n     - 16\\n     - 41\\n     - 490.2\\n   * - 8\\n     - 25\\n     - 64\\n     - 89\\n     - 719.1\\n   * - 8\\n     - 25\\n     - 128\\n     - 153\\n     - 836.6\\n\\nWhen a transaction length is short, the cost of the transaction interval is high. If possible, try to squash several short transactions into one transaction to achieve a higher transfer speed.\\n\\nPlease note that the ISR is disabled during flash operation by default. To keep sending transactions during flash operations, enable :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_ISR_IN_IRAM` and set :c:macro:`ESP_INTR_FLAG_IRAM` in the member :cpp:member:`spi_bus_config_t::intr_flags`. In this case, all the transactions queued before starting flash operations are handled by the ISR in parallel. Also note that the callback of each Device and their ``callee`` functions should be in IRAM, or your callback will crash due to cache missing. For more details, see :ref:`iram-safe-interrupt-handlers`.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    .. _timing_considerations:\\n\\n    Timing Considerations\\n    ---------------------\\n\\n    As shown in the figure below, there is a delay on the MISO line after the SCLK launch edge and before the signal is latched by the internal register. As a result, the MISO pin setup time is the limiting factor for the SPI clock speed. When the delay is too long, the setup slack is < 0, which means the setup timing requirement is violated and the reading might be incorrect.\\n\\n    .. image:: /../_static/spi_miso.png\\n        :scale: 40 %\\n        :align: center\\n\\n    .. wavedrom:: /../_static/diagrams/spi/miso_timing_waveform.json\\n\\n    The maximum allowed frequency is dependent on:\\n\\n    - :cpp:member:`spi_device_interface_config_t::input_delay_ns` - maximum data valid time on the MISO bus after a clock cycle on SCLK starts\\n    - If the IO_MUX pin or the GPIO Matrix is used\\n\\n    When the GPIO matrix is used, the maximum allowed frequency is reduced to about 33 ~ 77% in comparison to the existing **input delay**. To retain a higher frequency, you have to use the IO_MUX pins or the **dummy bit workaround**. You can obtain the maximum reading frequency of the master by using the function :cpp:func:`spi_get_freq_limit`.\\n\\n    .. _dummy_bit_workaround:\\n\\n    **Dummy bit workaround**: Dummy clocks, during which the Host does not read data, can be inserted before the Read phase begins. The Device still sees the dummy clocks and sends out data, but the Host does not read until the Read phase comes. This compensates for the lack of the MISO setup time required by the Host and allows the Host to do reading at a higher frequency.\\n\\n    In the ideal case, if the Device is so fast that the input delay is shorter than an APB clock cycle - 12.5 ns - the maximum frequency at which the Host can read (or read and write) in different conditions is as follows:\\n\\n    .. list-table::\\n       :widths: 30 45 40 30\\n       :header-rows: 1\\n\\n       * - Frequency Limit (MHz)\\n         - Frequency Limit (MHz)\\n         - Dummy Bits Used by Driver\\n         - Comments\\n       * - GPIO Matrix\\n         - IO_MUX Pins\\n         -\\n         -\\n       * - 26.6\\n         - 80\\n         - No\\n         -\\n       * - 40\\n         - --\\n         - Yes\\n         - Half-duplex, no DMA allowed\\n\\n    If the Host only writes data, the **dummy bit workaround** and the frequency check can be disabled by setting the bit ``SPI_DEVICE_NO_DUMMY`` in the member :cpp:member:`spi_device_interface_config_t::flags`. When disabled, the output frequency can be 80 MHz, even if the GPIO matrix is used.\\n\\n    :cpp:member:`spi_device_interface_config_t::flags`\\n\\n    The SPI Master driver still works even if the :cpp:member:`spi_device_interface_config_t::input_delay_ns` in the structure :cpp:type:`spi_device_interface_config_t` is set to 0. However, setting an accurate value helps to:\\n\\n    - Calculate the frequency limit for full-duplex transactions\\n    - Compensate the timing correctly with dummy bits for half-duplex transactions\\n\\n    You can approximate the maximum data valid time after the launch edge of SPI clocks by checking the statistics in the AC characteristics chapter of your Device\\'s specification or measure the time using an oscilloscope or logic analyzer.\\n\\n    Please note that the actual PCB layout design and excessive loads may increase the input delay. It means that non-optimal wiring and/or a load capacitor on the bus will most likely lead to input delay values exceeding the values given in the Device specification or measured while the bus is floating.\\n\\n    Some typical delay values are shown in the following table. These data are retrieved when the slave Device is on a different physical chip.\\n\\n    .. list-table::\\n       :widths: 40 20\\n       :header-rows: 1\\n\\n       * - Device\\n         - Input Delay (ns)\\n       * - Ideal Device\\n         - 0\\n       * - ESP32 slave using IO_MUX\\n         - 50\\n       * - ESP32 slave using GPIO_MATRIX\\n         - 75\\n\\n    The MISO path delay (valid time) consists of a slave\\'s **input delay** plus the master\\'s **GPIO matrix delay**. The delay determines the above frequency limit for full-duplex transfers. Once exceeding, full-duplex transfers will not work as well as the half-duplex transactions that use dummy bits. The frequency limit is:\\n\\n        *Freq limit [MHz] = 80 / (floor(MISO delay[ns]/12.5) + 1)*\\n\\n    The figure below shows the relationship between frequency limit and input delay. Two extra APB clock cycle periods should be added to the MISO delay if the master uses the GPIO matrix.\\n\\n    .. image:: /../_static/spi_master_freq_tv.png\\n\\n    Corresponding frequency limits for different Devices with different **input delay** times are shown in the table below.\\n\\n    When the master is IO_MUX (0 ns):\\n\\n    .. list-table::\\n       :widths: 20 40 40\\n       :header-rows: 1\\n\\n       * - Input Delay (ns)\\n         - MISO Path Delay (ns)\\n         - Freq.

       " \"SPI Slave Half Duplex\\n=====================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nThe Half Duplex (HD) Mode is a special mode provided by ESP SPI Slave peripheral. Under this mode, the hardware provides more services than the Full Duplex (FD) Mode (the mode for general-purpose SPI transactions, see :doc:`spi_slave`). These services reduce the CPU load and the response time of SPI Slave. However, it is important to note that the communication format is determined by the hardware and is always in a half-duplex configuration, allowing only one-way data transfer at any given time. Hence, the mode is named Half Duplex Mode due to this characteristic.\\n\\nWhen conducting an SPI transaction, transactions can be classified into several types based on the **command** phase of the transaction. Each transaction may consist of the following phases: command, address, dummy, and data. The command phase is mandatory, while the other phases may be determined by the command field. During the command, address, and dummy phases, the bus is always controlled by the master (usually the host), while the direction of the data phase depends on the command. The data phase can be either an input phase, where the master writes data to the slave (e.g., the host sends data to the slave), or an output phase, where the master reads data from the slave (e.g., the host receives data from the slave).\\n\\nProtocol\\n^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAbout the details of how master should communicate with the SPI Slave, see :doc:`/api-reference/protocols/esp_spi_slave_protocol`.\\n\\nThrough these different transactions, the slave provides these services to the master:\\n\\n- A DMA channel for the master to write a great amount of data to the slave.\\n- A DMA channel for the master to read a great amount of data from the slave.\\n- Several general purpose registers, shared between the master and the slave.\\n- Several general purpose interrupts, for the master to interrupt the SW of the slave.\\n\\nTerminology\\n-----------\\n\\n- Transaction\\n- Channel\\n- Sending\\n- Receiving\\n- Data Descriptor\\n\\nDriver Feature\\n--------------\\n\\n- Transaction read/write by master in segments\\n\\n- Queues for data to send and received\\n\\nDriver Usage\\n------------\\n\\nSlave Initialization\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nCall :cpp:func:`spi_slave_hd_init` to initialize the SPI bus as well as the peripheral and the driver. The SPI Slave exclusively uses the SPI peripheral, pins of the bus before it is deinitialized, which means other devices are unable to use the above resources during initialization. Thus, to ensure SPI resources are correctly occupied and the connections work properly, most configurations of the slave should be done as soon as the slave is initialized.\\n\\nThe :cpp:type:`spi_bus_config_t` specifies how the bus should be initialized, while :cpp:type:`spi_slave_hd_slot_config_t` specifies how the SPI Slave driver should work.\\n\\nDeinitialization (Optional)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nCall :cpp:func:`spi_slave_hd_deinit` to uninstall the driver. The resources, including the pins, SPI peripheral, internal memory used by the driver, and interrupt sources, are released by the ``deinit()`` function.\\n\\nSend/Receive Data by DMA Channels\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTo send data to the master through the sending DMA channel, the application should properly wrap the data in an :cpp:type:`spi_slave_hd_data_t` descriptor structure before calling :cpp:func:`spi_slave_hd_queue_trans` with the data descriptor and the channel argument of :cpp:enumerator:`SPI_SLAVE_CHAN_TX`. The pointers to descriptors are stored in the queue, and the data is sent to the master in the same order they are enqueued using :cpp:func:`spi_slave_hd_queue_trans`, upon receiving the master's ``Rd_DMA`` command.\\n\\nThe application should check the result of data sending by calling :cpp:func:`spi_slave_hd_get_trans_res` with the channel set as :cpp:enumerator:`SPI_SLAVE_CHAN_TX`. This function blocks until the transaction with the command ``Rd_DMA`` from the master successfully completes (or timeout). The ``out_trans`` argument of the function outputs the pointer of the data descriptor which is just finished, providing information about the sending.\\n\\nReceiving data from the master through the receiving DMA channel is quite similar. The application calls :cpp:func:`spi_slave_hd_queue_trans` with proper data descriptor and the channel argument of :cpp:enumerator:`SPI_SLAVE_CHAN_RX`. And the application calls the :cpp:func:`spi_slave_hd_get_trans_res` later to get the descriptor to the receiving buffer before it handles the data in the receiving buffer.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    This driver itself does not have an internal buffer for the data to send or just received. The application should provide data buffer for driver via data descriptors to send to the master, or to receive data from the master.\\n\\n    The application has to properly keep the data descriptor as well as the buffer it points, after the descriptor is successfully sent into the driver internal queue by :cpp:func:`spi_slave_hd_queue_trans`, and before returned by :cpp:func:`spi_slave_hd_get_trans_res`. During this period, the hardware as well as the driver may read or write to the buffer and the descriptor when required at any time.\\n\\nPlease note that, when using this driver for data transfer, the buffer does not have to be fully sent or filled before it is terminated. For example, in the segment transaction mode, the master has to send ``CMD7`` to terminate a ``Wr_DMA`` transaction or send ``CMD8`` to terminate an ``Rd_DMA`` transaction (in segments), no matter whether the send (receive) buffer is used up (full) or not.\\n\\n.. _spi_slave_hd_data_arguments:\\n\\nUsing Data Descriptor with Customized User Arguments\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSometimes you may have initiator (sending data descriptor) and closure (handling returned descriptors) functions in different places. When you get the returned data descriptor in the closure, you may need some extra information when handling the finished data descriptor. For example, you may want to know which round it is for the returned descriptor when you send the same piece of data several times.\\n\\nSet the ``arg`` member in the data descriptor to a variable indicating the transaction by force casting, or point it to a structure that wraps all the information you may need when handling the sending/receiving data. Then you can get what you need in your closure.\\n\\n.. _spi_slave_hd_callbacks:\\n\\nUsing Callbacks\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    These callbacks are called in the ISR, so the required operations need to be processed quickly and returned as soon as possible to ensure that the system is functioning properly. You may need to be very careful to write the code in the ISR.\\n\\n    Since the interrupt handling is executed concurrently with the application, long delays or blocking may cause the system to respond slower or lead to unpredictable behavior. Therefore, when writing callback functions, avoid using operations that may cause delays or blocking, e.g., waiting, sleeping, resource locking, etc.\\n\\nThe :cpp:type:`spi_slave_hd_callback_config_t` member in the :cpp:type:`spi_slave_hd_slot_config_t` configuration structure passed when initializing the SPI Slave HD driver, allows you to have callbacks for each event you may concern.\\n\\nThe corresponding interrupt for each callback that is not **NULL** is enabled, so that the callbacks can be called immediately when the events happen. You do not need to provide callbacks for the unconcerned events.\\n\\nThe ``arg`` member in the configuration structure can help you pass some context to the callback or indicate the specific SPI Slave instance when using the same callbacks for multiple SPI Slave peripherals. You can set the arg member to a variable that indicates the SPI Slave instance by performing a forced type casting or point it to a context structure. All the callbacks are called with this ``arg`` argument you set when the callbacks are initialized.\\n\\nThere are two other arguments: the ``event`` and the ``awoken``.\\n\\n    - The ``event`` passes the information of the current event to the callback. The :cpp:type:`spi_slave_hd_event_t` type contains the information of the event, for example, event type, the data descriptor just finished (The :ref:`data argument <spi_slave_hd_data_arguments>` is very useful in this case!).\\n    - The ``awoken`` argument serves as an output parameter. It informs the ISR that tasks have been awakened after the callback function, and the ISR should call `portYIELD_FROM_ISR()` to schedule these tasks. Simply pass the ``awoken`` argument to all FreeRTOS APIs that may unblock tasks, and the value of ``awoken`` will be returned to the ISR.\\n\\nWriting/Reading Shared Registers\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nCall :cpp:func:`spi_slave_hd_write_buffer` to write the shared buffer, and :cpp:func:`spi_slave_hd_read_buffer` to read the shared buffer.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    On {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, the shared registers are read/written in words by the application but read/written in bytes by the master. There is no guarantee four continuous bytes read from the master are from the same word written by the slave's application. It is also possible that if the slave reads a word while the master is writing bytes of the word, the slave may get one word with half of them just written by the master, and the other half has not been written into.\\n\\n    The master can confirm that the word is not in transition by reading the word twice and comparing the values.\\n\\n    For the slave, it is more difficult to ensure the word is not in transition because the process of master writing four bytes can be very long (32 SPI clocks). You can put some CRC in the last (largest address) byte of a word so that when the byte is written, the word is sure to be all written.\\n\\n    Due to the conflicts that may be among read/write from SW (worse if there are multi-cores) and master, it is suggested that a word is only used in one direction (only written by the master or only written by the slave).\\n\\nReceiving General Purpose Interrupts from the Master\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen the master sends ``CMD8``, ``CMD9`` or ``CMDA``, the slave corresponding is triggered. Currently the ``CMD8`` is permanently used to indicate the termination of ``Rd_DMA`` segments. To receive general-purpose interrupts, register callbacks for ``CMD9`` and ``CMDA`` when the slave is initialized, see :ref:`spi_slave_hd_callbacks`.\\n\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe code example for Device/Host communication can be found in the :example:`peripherals/spi_slave_hd` directory of ESP-IDF examples.\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/spi_slave_hd.inc\\n\",\n",

A UART provides a widely adopted and cheap method to realize full-duplex or half-duplex data exchange among different devices.\\n\\nThe {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip has {IDF_TARGET_SOC_UART_HP_NUM} UART controllers (also referred to as port), each featuring an identical set of registers to simplify programming and for more flexibility.\\n\\nEach UART controller is independently configurable with parameters such as baud rate, data bit length, bit ordering, number of stop bits, parity bit, etc. All the regular UART controllers are compatible with UART-enabled devices from various manufacturers and can also support Infrared Data Association (IrDA) protocols.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_UART_HAS_LP_UART\\n\\n    Additionally, the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip has one low-power (LP) UART controller. It is the cut-down version of regular UART. Usually, the LP UART controller only support basic UART functionality with a much smaller RAM size, and does not support IrDA or RS485 protocols. For a full list of difference between UART and LP UART, please refer to the **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **UART Controller (UART)** > **Features** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#uart>`__]).\\n\\nFunctional Overview\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe overview describes how to establish communication between an {IDF_TARGET_NAME} and other UART devices using the functions and data types of the UART driver. A typical programming workflow is broken down into the sections provided below:\\n\\n1. :ref:`uart-api-setting-communication-parameters` - Setting baud rate, data bits, stop bits, etc.\\n2. :ref:`uart-api-setting-communication-pins` - Assigning pins for connection to a device\\n3. :ref:`uart-api-driver-installation` - Allocating {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s resources for the UART driver\\n4. :ref:`uart-api-running-uart-communication` - Sending/receiving data\\n5. :ref:`uart-api-using-interrupts` - Triggering interrupts on specific communication events\\n6. :ref:`uart-api-deleting-driver` - Freeing allocated resources if a UART communication is no longer required\\n\\nSteps 1 to 3 comprise the configuration stage.

This identification is needed for all the following function calls.\\n\\n\\n.. _uart-api-setting-communication-parameters:\\n\\nSet Communication Parameters\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nUART communication parameters can be configured all in a single step or individually in multiple steps.\\n\\n\\nSingle Step\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nCall the function :cpp:func:`uart_param_config` and pass to it a :cpp:type:`uart_config_t` structure.

For example, to check the current baud rate value, call :cpp:func:`uart_get_baudrate`.\\n\\n\\n.. _uart-api-setting-communication-pins:\\n\\nSet Communication Pins\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAfter setting communication parameters, configure the physical GPIO pins to which the other UART device will be connected. For this, call the function :cpp:func:`uart_set_pin` and specify the GPIO pin numbers to which the driver should route the TX, RX, RTS, and CTS signals. If you want to keep a currently allocated pin number for a specific signal, pass the macro :c:macro:`UART_PIN_NO_CHANGE`.\\n\\nThe same macro :c:macro:`UART_PIN_NO_CHANGE` should be specified for pins that will not be used.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n  // Set UART pins(TX: IO4, RX: IO5, RTS: IO18, CTS: IO19)\\n  ESP_ERROR_CHECK(uart_set_pin({IDF_TARGET_UART_EXAMPLE_PORT}, 4, 5, 18, 19));\\n\\n.. _uart-api-driver-installation:\\n\\nInstall Drivers\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nOnce the communication pins are set, install the driver by calling :cpp:func:`uart_driver_install` and specify the following parameters:\\n\\n- Size of TX ring buffer\\n- Size of RX ring buffer\\n- Event queue handle and size\\n- Flags to allocate an interrupt\\n\\nThe function allocates the required internal resources for the UART driver.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    // Setup UART buffered IO with event queue\\n    const int uart_buffer_size = (1024 * 2);\\n    QueueHandle_t uart_queue;\\n    // Install UART driver using an event queue here\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(uart_driver_install({IDF_TARGET_UART_EXAMPLE_PORT}, uart_buffer_size, \\\\\\n                                            uart_buffer_size, 10, &uart_queue, 0));\\n\\nOnce this step is complete, you can connect the external UART device and check the communication.\\n\\n\\n.. _uart-api-running-uart-communication:\\n\\nRun UART Communication\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSerial communication is controlled by each UART controller\\'s finite state machine (FSM).\\n\\nThe process of sending data involves the following steps:\\n\\n1. Write data into TX FIFO buffer\\n2. FSM serializes the data\\n3. FSM sends the data out\\n\\nThe process of receiving data is similar, but the steps are reversed:\\n\\n1. FSM processes an incoming serial stream and parallelizes it\\n2. FSM writes the data into RX FIFO buffer\\n3. Read the data from RX FIFO buffer\\n\\nTherefore, an application only writes and reads data from a specific buffer using :cpp:func:`uart_write_bytes` and :cpp:func:`uart_read_bytes` respectively, and the FSM does the rest.\\n\\n\\nTransmit Data\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nAfter preparing the data for transmission, call the function :cpp:func:`uart_write_bytes` and pass the data buffer\\'s address and data length to it. The function copies the data to the TX ring buffer (either immediately or after enough space is available), and then exit. When there is free space in the TX FIFO buffer, an interrupt service routine (ISR) moves the data from the TX ring buffer to the TX FIFO buffer in the background. The code below demonstrates the use of this function.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    // Write data to UART.\\n    char* test_str = \"This is a test string.\\\\n\";\\n    uart_write_bytes(uart_num, (const char*)test_str, strlen(test_str));\\n\\nThe function :cpp:func:`uart_write_bytes_with_break` is similar to :cpp:func:`uart_write_bytes` but adds a serial break signal at the end of the transmission. A \\'serial break signal\\' means holding the TX line low for a period longer than one data frame.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    // Write data to UART, end with a break signal.\\n    uart_write_bytes_with_break(uart_num, \"test break\\\\n\",strlen(\"test break\\\\n\"), 100);\\n\\nAnother function for writing data to the TX FIFO buffer is :cpp:func:`uart_tx_chars`. Unlike :cpp:func:`uart_write_bytes`, this function does not block until space is available. Instead, it writes all data which can immediately fit into the hardware TX FIFO, and then return the number of bytes that were written.\\n\\nThere is a \\'companion\\' function :cpp:func:`uart_wait_tx_done` that monitors the status of the TX FIFO buffer and returns once it is empty.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    // Wait for packet to be sent\\n    const uart_port_t uart_num = {IDF_TARGET_UART_EXAMPLE_PORT};\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(uart_wait_tx_done(uart_num, 100)); // wait timeout is 100 RTOS ticks (TickType_t)\\n\\n\\nReceive Data\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nOnce the data is received by the UART and saved in the RX FIFO buffer, it needs to be retrieved using the function :cpp:func:`uart_read_bytes`. Before reading data, you can check the number of bytes available in the RX FIFO buffer by calling :cpp:func:`uart_get_buffered_data_len`. An example of using these functions is given below.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    // Read data from UART.\\n    const uart_port_t uart_num = {IDF_TARGET_UART_EXAMPLE_PORT};\\n    uint8_t data[128];\\n    int length = 0;\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(uart_get_buffered_data_len(uart_num, (size_t*)&length));\\n    length = uart_read_bytes(uart_num, data, length, 100);\\n\\nIf the data in the RX FIFO buffer is no longer needed, you can clear the buffer by calling :cpp:func:`uart_flush`.\\n\\n\\nSoftware Flow Control\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nIf the hardware flow control is disabled, you can manually set the RTS and DTR signal levels by using the functions :cpp:func:`uart_set_rts` and :cpp:func:`uart_set_dtr` respectively.\\n\\n\\nCommunication Mode Selection\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nThe UART controller supports a number of communication modes. A mode can be selected using the function :cpp:func:`uart_set_mode`. Once a specific mode is selected, the UART driver handles the behavior of a connected UART device accordingly. As an example, it can control the RS485 driver chip using the RTS line to allow half-duplex RS485 communication.\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    // Setup UART in rs485 half duplex mode\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(uart_set_mode(uart_num, UART_MODE_RS485_HALF_DUPLEX));\\n\\n\\n.. _uart-api-using-interrupts:\\n\\nUse Interrupts\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThere are many interrupts that can be generated depending on specific UART states or detected errors. The full list of available interrupts is provided in *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* > *UART Controller (UART)* > *UART Interrupts* and *UHCI Interrupts* [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#uart>`__]. You can enable or disable specific interrupts by calling :cpp:func:`uart_enable_intr_mask` or :cpp:func:`uart_disable_intr_mask` respectively.\\n\\nThe :cpp:func:`uart_driver_install` function installs the driver\\'s internal interrupt handler to manage the TX and RX ring buffers and provides high-level API functions like events (see below).\\n\\nThe API provides a convenient way to handle specific interrupts discussed in this document by wrapping them into dedicated functions:\\n\\n- **Event detection**: There are several events defined in :cpp:type:`uart_event_type_t` that may be reported to a user application using the FreeRTOS queue functionality. You can enable this functionality when calling :cpp:func:`uart_driver_install` described in :ref:`uart-api-driver-installation`. An example of using Event detection can be found in :example:`peripherals/uart/uart_events`.\\n\\n- **FIFO space threshold or transmission timeout reached**: The TX and RX FIFO buffers can trigger an interrupt when they are filled with a specific number of characters, or on a timeout of sending or receiving data. To use these interrupts, do the following:\\n\\n    - Configure respective threshold values of the buffer length and timeout by entering them in the structure :cpp:type:`uart_intr_config_t` and calling :cpp:func:`uart_intr_config`\\n    - Enable the interrupts using the functions :cpp:func:`uart_enable_tx_intr` and :cpp:func:`uart_enable_rx_intr`\\n    - Disable these interrupts using the corresponding functions :cpp:func:`uart_disable_tx_intr` or :cpp:func:`uart_disable_rx_intr`\\n\\n- **Pattern detection**: An interrupt triggered on detecting a \\'pattern\\' of the same character being received/sent repeatedly. This functionality is demonstrated in the example :example:`peripherals/uart/uart_events`. It can be used, e.g., to detect a command string with a specific number of identical characters (the \\'pattern\\') at the end. The following functions are available:\\n\\n    - Configure and enable this interrupt using :cpp:func:`uart_enable_pattern_det_baud_intr`\\n    - Disable the interrupt using :cpp:func:`uart_disable_pattern_det_intr`\\n\\n\\n.. _uart-api-deleting-driver:\\n\\nDeleting a Driver\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf the communication established with :cpp:func:`uart_driver_install` is no longer required, the driver can be removed to free allocated resources by calling :cpp:func:`uart_driver_delete`.\\n\\n\\nMacros\\n^^^^^^\\n\\nThe API also defines several macros. For example, :c:macro:`UART_HW_FIFO_LEN` defines the length of hardware FIFO buffers; :c:macro:`UART_BITRATE_MAX` gives the maximum baud rate supported by the UART controllers, etc.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_UART_HAS_LP_UART\\n\\n    .. _uart-api-lp-uart-driver:\\n\\n    Use LP UART Controller with HP Core\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The UART driver also supports to control the LP UART controller when the chip is in active mode. The configuration steps for the LP UART are the same as the steps for a normal UART controller, except:\\n\\n    .. list::\\n\\n        - The port number for the LP UART controller is defined by :c:macro:`LP_UART_NUM_0`.\\n        - The available clock sources for the LP UART controller can be found in :cpp:type:`lp_uart_sclk_t`.\\n        - The size of the hardware FIFO for the LP UART controller is much smaller, which is defined in :c:macro:`SOC_LP_UART_FIFO_LEN`.\\n        :SOC_LP_GPIO_MATRIX_SUPPORTED: - The GPIO pins for the LP UART controller can only be selected from the LP GPIO pins.\\n        :not SOC_LP_GPIO_MATRIX_SUPPORTED: - The GPIO pins for the LP UART controller are unalterable, because there is no LP GPIO matrix on the target.

The term collision means that a transmitted datagram is not equal to the one received on the other end. Data collisions are usually associated with the presence of other active devices on the bus or might occur due to bus errors.\\n\\nThe collision detection feature allows handling collisions when their interrupts are activated and triggered. The interrupts ``UART_RS485_FRM_ERR_INT`` and ``UART_RS485_PARITY_ERR_INT`` can be used with the collision detection feature to control frame errors and parity bit errors accordingly in RS485 mode. This functionality is supported in the UART driver and can be used by selecting the :cpp:enumerator:`UART_MODE_RS485_APP_CTRL` mode (see the function :cpp:func:`uart_set_mode`).\\n\\nThe collision detection feature can work with circuit A and circuit C (see Section `Interface Connection Options`_). In the case of using circuit A or B, the RTS pin connected to the DE pin of the bus driver should be controlled by the user application. Use the function :cpp:func:`uart_get_collision_flag` to check if the collision detection flag has been raised.\\n\\nThe {IDF_TARGET_NAME} UART controllers themselves do not support half-duplex communication as they cannot provide automatic control of the RTS pin connected to the RE/DE input of RS485 bus driver. However, half-duplex communication can be achieved via software control of the RTS pin by the UART driver. This can be enabled by selecting the :cpp:enumerator:`UART_MODE_RS485_HALF_DUPLEX` mode when calling :cpp:func:`uart_set_mode`.\\n\\nOnce the host starts writing data to the TX FIFO buffer, the UART driver automatically asserts the RTS pin (logic 1); once the last bit of the data has been transmitted, the driver de-asserts the RTS pin (logic 0). To use this mode, the software would have to disable the hardware flow control function. This mode works with all the used circuits shown below.\\n\\n\\nInterface Connection Options\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThis section provides example schematics to demonstrate the basic aspects of {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s RS485 interface connection.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    - The schematics below do **not** necessarily contain **all required elements**.\\n\\n    - The **analog devices** ADM483 & ADM2483 are examples of common RS485 transceivers and **can be replaced** with other similar transceivers.\\n\\n\\nCircuit A: Collision Detection Circuit\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n         VCC ---------------+\\n                            |\\n                    +-------x-------+\\n         RXD <------| R             |\\n                    |              B|----------<> B\\n         TXD ------>| D    ADM483   |\\n ESP                |               |     RS485 bus side\\n         RTS ------>| DE            |\\n                    |              A|----------<> A\\n               +----| /RE           |\\n               |    +-------x-------+\\n               |            |\\n              GND          GND\\n\\nThis circuit is preferable because it allows for collision detection and is quite simple at the same time.

However, signals can also be routed to other pins using the less direct GPIO matrix. To use direct routes, you need to know which pin is a dedicated IO_MUX pin for a UART channel. GPIO Lookup Macros simplify the process of finding and assigning IO_MUX pins. You choose a macro based on either the IO_MUX pin number, or a required UART channel name, and the macro returns the matching counterpart for you. See some examples below.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    These macros are useful if you need very high UART baud rates (over 40 MHz), which means you will have to use IO_MUX pins only. In other cases, these macros can be ignored, and you can use the GPIO Matrix as it allows you to configure any GPIO pin for any UART function.\\n\\n1. :c:macro:`UART_NUM_2_TXD_DIRECT_GPIO_NUM` returns the IO_MUX pin number of UART channel 2 TXD pin (pin 17)\\n2. :c:macro:`UART_GPIO19_DIRECT_CHANNEL` returns the UART number of GPIO 19 when connected to the UART peripheral via IO_MUX (this is UART_NUM_0)\\n3. :c:macro:`UART_CTS_GPIO19_DIRECT_CHANNEL` returns the UART number of GPIO 19 when used as the UART CTS pin via IO_MUX (this is UART_NUM_0).

       " \"SD SPI Host Driver\\n==================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nThe SD SPI host driver allows communication with one or more SD cards using the SPI Master driver, which utilizes the SPI host. Each card is accessed through an SD SPI device, represented by an SD SPI handle :cpp:type:`sdspi_dev_handle_t`, which returns when the device is attached to an SPI bus by calling :cpp:func:`sdspi_host_init_device`. It is important to note that the SPI bus should be initialized beforehand by :cpp:func:`spi_bus_initialize`.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    This driver's naming pattern was adopted from the :doc:`sdmmc_host` due to their similarity. Likewise, the APIs of both drivers are also very similar.\\n\\n    SD SPI driver that accesses the SD card in SPI mode offers lower throughput but makes pin selection more flexible. With the help of the GPIO matrix, an SPI peripheral's signals can be routed to any {IDF_TARGET_NAME} pin. Otherwise, if an SDMMC host driver is used (see :doc:`sdmmc_host`) to access the card in SD 1-bit/4-bit mode, higher throughput can be reached while requiring routing the signals through their dedicated IO_MUX pins only.\\n\\nWith the help of :doc:`spi_master` the SD SPI host driver based on, the SPI bus can be shared among SD cards and other SPI devices. The SPI Master driver will handle exclusive access from different tasks.\\n\\nThe SD SPI driver uses software-controlled CS signal.\\n\\nHow to Use\\n----------\\n\\nFirstly, use the macro :c:macro:`SDSPI_DEVICE_CONFIG_DEFAULT` to initialize the structure :cpp:type:`sdspi_device_config_t`, which is used to initialize an SD SPI device. This macro will also fill in the default pin mappings, which are the same as the pin mappings of the SDMMC host driver. Modify the host and pins of the structure to desired value. Then call ``sdspi_host_init_device`` to initialize the SD SPI device and attach to its bus.\\n\\nThen use the :c:macro:`SDSPI_HOST_DEFAULT` macro to initialize the :cpp:type:`sdmmc_host_t` structure, which is used to store the state and configurations of the upper layer (SD/SDIO/MMC driver). Modify the ``slot`` parameter of the structure to the SD SPI device SD SPI handle just returned from ``sdspi_host_init_device``. Call ``sdmmc_card_init`` with the :cpp:type:`sdmmc_host_t` to probe and initialize the SD card.\\n\\nNow you can use SD/SDIO/MMC driver functions to access your card!\\n\\nOther Details\\n-------------\\n\\nOnly the following driver's API functions are normally used by most applications:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`sdspi_host_init`\\n- :cpp:func:`sdspi_host_init_device`\\n- :cpp:func:`sdspi_host_remove_device`\\n- :cpp:func:`sdspi_host_deinit`\\n\\nOther functions are mostly used by the protocol level SD/SDIO/MMC driver via function pointers in the :cpp:type:`sdmmc_host_t` structure. For more details, see :doc:`../storage/sdmmc`.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    SD over SPI does not support speeds above :c:macro:`SDMMC_FREQ_DEFAULT` due to the limitations of the SPI driver.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    If you want to share the SPI bus among SD card and other SPI devices, there are some restrictions, see :doc:`sdspi_share`.\\n\\n.. todo\\n\\n..

       " 'Dedicated GPIO\\n==============\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nThe dedicated GPIO is designed for CPU interaction with GPIO matrix and IO MUX. Any GPIO that is configured as \"dedicated\" can be access by CPU instructions directly, which makes it easy to achieve a high GPIO flip speed, and simulate serial/parallel interface in a bit-banging way. As toggling a GPIO in this \"CPU Dedicated\" way costs few overhead, it would be great for cases like performance measurement using an oscilloscope.\\n\\n\\nCreate/Destroy GPIO Bundle\\n--------------------------\\n\\nA GPIO bundle is a group of GPIOs, which can be manipulated at the same time in one CPU cycle. The maximal number of GPIOs that a bundle can contain is limited by each CPU. What\\'s more, the GPIO bundle has a strong relevance to the CPU which it derives from. **Any operations on the GPIO bundle should be put inside a task which is running on the same CPU core to the GPIO bundle belongs to.** Likewise, only those ISRs who are installed on the same CPU core are allowed to do operations on that GPIO bundle.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Dedicated GPIO is more of a CPU peripheral, so it has a strong relationship with CPU core. It\\'s highly recommended to install and operate GPIO bundle in a pin-to-core task. For example, if GPIOA is connected to CPU0, and the dedicated GPIO instruction is issued from CPU1, then it\\'s impossible to control GPIOA.\\n\\nTo install a GPIO bundle, one needs to call :cpp:func:`dedic_gpio_new_bundle` to allocate the software resources and connect the dedicated channels to user selected GPIOs. Configurations for a GPIO bundle are covered in :cpp:type:`dedic_gpio_bundle_config_t` structure:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`gpio_array`: An array that contains GPIO number.\\n- :cpp:member:`array_size`: Element number of :cpp:member:`gpio_array`.\\n- :cpp:member:`flags`: Extra flags to control the behavior of GPIO Bundle.\\n\\n  - :cpp:member:`in_en` and :cpp:member:`out_en` are used to select whether to enable the input and output function (note, they can be enabled together).\\n  - :cpp:member:`in_invert` and :cpp:member:`out_invert` are used to select whether to invert the GPIO signal.\\n\\nThe following code shows how to install a output only GPIO bundle:\\n\\n.. highlight:: c\\n\\n::\\n\\n    // configure GPIO\\n    const int bundleA_gpios[] = {0, 1};\\n    gpio_config_t io_conf = {\\n        .mode = GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT,\\n    };\\n    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(bundleA_gpios) / sizeof(bundleA_gpios[0]); i++) {\\n        io_conf.pin_bit_mask = 1ULL << bundleA_gpios[i];\\n        gpio_config(&io_conf);\\n    }\\n    // Create bundleA, output only\\n    dedic_gpio_bundle_handle_t bundleA = NULL;\\n    dedic_gpio_bundle_config_t bundleA_config = {\\n        .gpio_array = bundleA_gpios,\\n        .array_size = sizeof(bundleA_gpios) / sizeof(bundleA_gpios[0]),\\n        .flags = {\\n            .out_en = 1,\\n        },\\n    };\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(dedic_gpio_new_bundle(&bundleA_config, &bundleA));\\n\\nTo uninstall the GPIO bundle, one needs to call :cpp:func:`dedic_gpio_del_bundle`.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    :cpp:func:`dedic_gpio_new_bundle` doesn\\'t cover any GPIO pad configuration (e.g., pull up/down, drive ability, output/input enable), so before installing a dedicated GPIO bundle, you have to configure the GPIO separately using GPIO driver API (e.g., :cpp:func:`gpio_config`).

The internal temperature of a chip is usually higher than the ambient temperature, and is affected by factors such as the microcontroller\\'s clock frequency or I/O load, and the external thermal environment.\\n\\nFunctional Overview\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe description of the temperature sensor functionality is divided into the following sections:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - :ref:`temp-resource-allocation` - covers which parameters should be set up to get a temperature sensor handle and how to recycle the resources when the temperature sensor finishes working.\\n    - :ref:`temp-enable-and-disable-temperature-sensor` - covers how to enable and disable the temperature sensor.\\n    - :ref:`temp-get-temperature-value` - covers how to get the real-time temperature value.\\n    :SOC_TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_INTR_SUPPORT: - :ref:`temp-install-temperature-threshold-callback` - describes how to register a temperature threshold callback.\\n    - :ref:`temp-power-management` - covers how the temperature sensor is affected when changing power mode (e.g., Light-sleep mode).\\n    :SOC_TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_INTR_SUPPORT: - :ref:`temp-iram-safe` - describes tips on how to make the temperature sensor interrupt work better along with a disabled cache.\\n    - :ref:`temp-thread-safety` - covers how to make the driver to be thread-safe.\\n    :SOC_TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_SUPPORT_ETM: - :ref:`temperature-sensor-etm-event-and-task` - describes what the events and tasks can be connected to the ETM channel.\\n\\n.. _temp-resource-allocation:\\n\\nResource Allocation\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has just one built-in temperature sensor hardware. The temperature sensor instance is represented by :cpp:type:`temperature_sensor_handle_t`, which is also the bond of the context. By using :cpp:type:`temperature_sensor_handle_t`, the temperature sensor properties can be accessed and modified in different function calls to control and manage the temperature sensor. The variable would always be the parameter of the temperature APIs with the information of hardware and configurations, so you can just create a pointer of type :cpp:type:`temperature_sensor_handle_t` and passing to APIs as needed.\\n\\nIn order to install a built-in temperature sensor instance, the first thing is to evaluate the temperature range in your detection environment. For example, if the testing environment is in a room, the range you evaluate might be 10 °C ~ 30 °C; if the testing in a lamp bulb, the range you evaluate might be 60 °C ~ 110 °C. Based on that, configuration structure :cpp:type:`temperature_sensor_config_t` should be defined in advance:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`range_min`: The minimum value of the testing range you have evaluated.\\n- :cpp:member:`range_max`: The maximum value of the testing range you have evaluated.\\n\\nAfter the ranges are set, the structure could be passed to :cpp:func:`temperature_sensor_install`, which will instantiate the temperature sensor instance and return a handle.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, different measure ranges have different measurement errors. You do not need to care about the measurement error because we have an internal mechanism to choose the minimum error according to the given range.\\n\\nIf the temperature sensor is no longer needed, you need to call :cpp:func:`temperature_sensor_uninstall` to free the temperature sensor resource.\\n\\nCreating a Temperature Sensor Handle\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n* Step 1: Evaluate the testing range. In this example, the range is 20 °C ~ 50 °C.\\n* Step 2: Configure the range and obtain a handle.\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    temperature_sensor_handle_t temp_handle = NULL;\\n    temperature_sensor_config_t temp_sensor_config = TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_CONFIG_DEFAULT(20, 50);\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(temperature_sensor_install(&temp_sensor_config, &temp_handle));\\n\\n.. _temp-enable-and-disable-temperature-sensor:\\n\\nEnable and Disable Temperature Sensor\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n1. Enable the temperature sensor by calling :cpp:func:`temperature_sensor_enable`. The internal temperature sensor circuit will start to work. The driver state will transit from init to enable.\\n2.

When the temperature value reaches a given threshold, an interrupt will happen. Thus you can install your own interrupt callback functions to do what they want, e.g., alarm, restart, etc. The following information indicates how to prepare a threshold callback.\\n\\n    - :cpp:member:`temperature_sensor_event_callbacks_t::on_threshold`: As this function is called within the ISR context, you must ensure that the function does not attempt to block, e.g., by making sure that only FreeRTOS APIs with the ``ISR`` suffix are called from within the function, etc. The function prototype is declared in :cpp:type:`temperature_thres_cb_t`.\\n\\n    You can save your own context to :cpp:func:`temperature_sensor_register_callbacks` as well, via the parameter ``user_arg``. The user data will be directly passed to the callback function.\\n\\n    .. code:: c\\n\\n        IRAM_ATTR static bool temp_sensor_monitor_cbs(temperature_sensor_handle_t tsens, const temperature_sensor_threshold_event_data_t *edata, void *user_data)\\n        {\\n            ESP_DRAM_LOGI(\"tsens\", \"Temperature value is higher or lower than threshold, value is %d\\\\n...\\\\n\\\\n\", edata->celsius_value);\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n\\n        // Callback configurations\\n        temperature_sensor_abs_threshold_config_t threshold_cfg = {\\n            .high_threshold = 50,\\n            .low_threshold = -10,\\n        };\\n        // Set absolute value monitor threshold.\\n        temperature_sensor_set_absolute_threshold(temp_sensor, &threshold_cfg);\\n        // Register interrupt callback\\n        temperature_sensor_event_callbacks_t cbs = {\\n            .on_threshold = temp_sensor_monitor_cbs,\\n        };\\n        // Install temperature callback.\\n        temperature_sensor_register_callbacks(temp_sensor, &cbs, NULL);\\n\\n    .. _temp-power-management:\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_INTR_SUPPORT\\n\\n    .. _temp-power-management:\\n\\nPower Management\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAs the temperature sensor does not use the APB clock, it will keep working no matter if the power management is enabled with ``CONFIG_PM_ENABLE``.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_INTR_SUPPORT\\n\\n    .. _temp-iram-safe:\\n\\n    IRAM Safe\\n    ^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    By default, the temperature sensor interrupt will be deferred when the cache is disabled for reasons like writing/erasing flash. Thus the event callback functions will not get executed in time, which is not expected in a real-time application.\\n\\n    There is a Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_TEMP_SENSOR_ISR_IRAM_SAFE` that will:\\n\\n    1. Enable the interrupt that is being serviced even when the cache is disabled.\\n    2. Place all functions that are used by the ISR into IRAM.\\n\\n    This allows the interrupt to run while the cache is disabled but comes at the cost of increased IRAM consumption.\\n\\n    .. _temp-thread-safety:\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_INTR_SUPPORT\\n\\n    .. _temp-thread-safety:\\n\\nThread Safety\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn the temperature sensor driver, we do not add any protection to ensure the thread safety, because typically this driver is only supposed to be used in one task. If you have to use this driver in different tasks, please add extra locks to protect it.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_SUPPORT_ETM\\n\\n    .. _temperature-sensor-etm-event-and-task:\\n\\n    ETM Event and Task\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Temperature Sensor is able to generate events that can interact with the :doc:`ETM </api-reference/peripherals/etm>` module. The supported events are listed in the :cpp:type:`temperature_sensor_etm_event_type_t`. You can call :cpp:func:`temperature_sensor_new_etm_event` to get the corresponding ETM event handle. The supported tasks are listed in the :cpp:type:`temperature_sensor_etm_task_type_t`. You can call :cpp:func:`temperature_sensor_new_etm_task` to get the corresponding ETM event handle.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        - :cpp:enumerator:`TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_EVENT_OVER_LIMIT` for :cpp:member:`temperature_sensor_etm_event_type_t::event_type` depends on what kind of threshold you set first. If you set the absolute threshold by :cpp:func:`temperature_sensor_set_absolute_threshold`, then the :cpp:enumerator:`TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_EVENT_OVER_LIMIT` refers to absolute threshold. Likewise, if you set the delta threshold by :cpp:func:`temperature_sensor_set_delta_threshold`, then the :cpp:enumerator:`TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_EVENT_OVER_LIMIT` refers to delta threshold.\\n\\n    For how to connect the event and task to an ETM channel, please refer to the :doc:`ETM </api-reference/peripherals/etm>` documentation.\\n\\nUnexpected Behaviors\\n--------------------\\n\\n1. The value you get from the chip is usually different from the ambient temperature. It is because the temperature sensor is built inside the chip. To some extent, it measures the temperature of the chip.\\n\\n2. When installing the temperature sensor, the driver may print ``the boundary you gave cannot meet the range of internal temperature sensor``. It is because the built-in temperature sensor has a testing limit. The error comes from the incorrect configuration of :cpp:type:`temperature_sensor_config_t` as follow:\\n\\n    (1) Totally out of range, like 200 °C ~ 300 °C.\\n    (2) Cross the boundary of each predefined measurement. like 40 °C ~ 110 °C.\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    * Temperature sensor reading example: :example:`peripherals/temperature_sensor/temp_sensor`.\\n    :SOC_TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_INTR_SUPPORT: * Temperature sensor value monitor example: :example:`peripherals/temperature_sensor/temp_sensor_monitor`.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/temperature_sensor.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/temperature_sensor_types.inc\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_SUPPORT_ETM\\n\\n    .. include-build-file:: inc/temperature_sensor_etm.inc\\n',\n",

It has {IDF_TARGET_SOC_LEDC_CHANNEL_NUM} channels which can generate independent waveforms that can be used, for example, to drive RGB LED devices.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    LEDC channels are divided into two groups of 8 channels each. One group of LEDC channels operates in high speed mode. This mode is implemented in hardware and offers automatic and glitch-free changing of the PWM duty cycle. The other group of channels operate in low speed mode, the PWM duty cycle must be changed by the driver in software. Each group of channels is also able to use different clock sources.\\n\\nThe PWM controller can automatically increase or decrease the duty cycle gradually, allowing for fades without any processor interference.\\n\\n\\nFunctionality Overview\\n----------------------\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    Setting up a channel of the LEDC in either :ref:`high or low speed mode <ledc-api-high_low_speed_mode>` is done in three steps:\\n\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n    Setting up a channel of the LEDC is done in three steps. Note that unlike ESP32, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} only supports configuring channels in \"low speed\" mode.\\n\\n1. :ref:`ledc-api-configure-timer` by specifying the PWM signal\\'s frequency and duty cycle resolution.\\n2. :ref:`ledc-api-configure-channel` by associating it with the timer and GPIO to output the PWM signal.\\n3. :ref:`ledc-api-change-pwm-signal` that drives the output in order to change LED\\'s intensity. This can be done under the full control of software or with hardware fading functions.\\n\\nAs an optional step, it is also possible to set up an interrupt on fade end.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/ledc-api-settings.jpg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Key Settings of LED PWM Controller\\'s API\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Key Settings of LED PWM Controller\\'s API\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    For an initial setup, it is recommended to configure for the timers first (by calling :cpp:func:`ledc_timer_config`), and then for the channels (by calling :cpp:func:`ledc_channel_config`). This ensures the PWM frequency is at the desired value since the appearance of the PWM signal from the IO pad.\\n\\n\\n.. _ledc-api-configure-timer:\\n\\nTimer Configuration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSetting the timer is done by calling the function :cpp:func:`ledc_timer_config` and passing the data structure :cpp:type:`ledc_timer_config_t` that contains the following configuration settings:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    :esp32:     - Speed mode :cpp:type:`ledc_mode_t`\\n    :not esp32: - Speed mode (value must be ``LEDC_LOW_SPEED_MODE``)\\n    - Timer number :cpp:type:`ledc_timer_t`\\n    - PWM signal frequency in Hz\\n    - Resolution of PWM duty\\n    - Source clock :cpp:type:`ledc_clk_cfg_t`\\n\\nThe frequency and the duty resolution are interdependent. The higher the PWM frequency, the lower the duty resolution which is available, and vice versa. This relationship might be important if you are planning to use this API for purposes other than changing the intensity of LEDs. For more details, see Section :ref:`ledc-api-supported-range-frequency-duty-resolution`.\\n\\nThe source clock can also limit the PWM frequency.

For {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, all timers share one clock source. In other words, it is impossible to use different clock sources for different timers.\\n\\nThe LEDC driver offers a helper function :cpp:func:`ledc_find_suitable_duty_resolution` to find the maximum possible resolution for the timer, given the source clock frequency and the desired PWM signal frequency.\\n\\nWhen a timer is no longer needed by any channel, it can be deconfigured by calling the same function :cpp:func:`ledc_timer_config`.

This is done by calling the function :cpp:func:`ledc_channel_config`.\\n\\nSimilar to the timer configuration, the channel setup function should be passed a structure :cpp:type:`ledc_channel_config_t` that contains the channel\\'s configuration parameters.\\n\\nAt this point, the channel should start operating and generating the PWM signal on the selected GPIO, as configured in :cpp:type:`ledc_channel_config_t`, with the frequency specified in the timer settings and the given duty cycle. The channel operation (signal generation) can be suspended at any time by calling the function :cpp:func:`ledc_stop`.\\n\\n\\n.. _ledc-api-change-pwm-signal:\\n\\nChange PWM Signal\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nOnce the channel starts operating and generating the PWM signal with the constant duty cycle and frequency, there are a couple of ways to change this signal. When driving LEDs, primarily the duty cycle is changed to vary the light intensity.\\n\\nThe following two sections describe how to change the duty cycle using software and hardware fading. If required, the signal\\'s frequency can also be changed; it is covered in Section :ref:`ledc-api-change-pwm-frequency`.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        All the timers and channels in the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s LED PWM Controller only support low speed mode.

After that, call :cpp:func:`ledc_update_duty` to activate the changes. To check the currently set value, use the corresponding ``_get_`` function :cpp:func:`ledc_get_duty`.\\n\\nAnother way to set the duty cycle, as well as some other channel parameters, is by calling :cpp:func:`ledc_channel_config` covered in Section :ref:`ledc-api-configure-channel`.\\n\\nThe range of the duty cycle values passed to functions depends on selected ``duty_resolution`` and should be from ``0`` to ``(2 ** duty_resolution)``. For example, if the selected duty resolution is 10, then the duty cycle values can range from 0 to 1024. This provides the resolution of ~ 0.1%.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32s2 or esp32s3 or esp32c3 or esp32c2 or esp32c6 or esp32h2 or esp32p4\\n\\n    .. warning::\\n\\n        On {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, when channel\\'s binded timer selects its maximum duty resolution, the duty cycle value cannot be set to ``(2 ** duty_resolution)``. Otherwise, the internal duty counter in the hardware will overflow and be messed up.\\n\\n\\nChange PWM Duty Cycle Using Hardware\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nThe LEDC hardware provides the means to gradually transition from one duty cycle value to another. To use this functionality, enable fading with :cpp:func:`ledc_fade_func_install` and then configure it by calling one of the available fading functions:\\n\\n* :cpp:func:`ledc_set_fade_with_time`\\n* :cpp:func:`ledc_set_fade_with_step`\\n* :cpp:func:`ledc_set_fade`\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_LEDC_GAMMA_CURVE_FADE_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    On {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, the hardware additionally allows to perform up to {IDF_TARGET_LEDC_MAX_FADE_RANGE_NUM} consecutive linear fades without CPU intervention. This feature can be useful if you want to do a fade with gamma correction.\\n\\n    The luminance perceived by human eyes does not have a linear relationship with the PWM duty cycle. In order to make human feel the LED is dimming or lightening linearly, the change in duty cycle should be non-linear, which is the so-called gamma correction. The LED controller can simulate a gamma curve fading by piecewise linear approximation. :cpp:func:`ledc_fill_multi_fade_param_list` is a function that can help to construct the parameters for the piecewise linear fades. First, you need to allocate a memory block for saving the fade parameters, then by providing start/end PWM duty cycle values, gamma correction function, and the total number of desired linear segments to the helper function, it will fill the calculation results into the allocated space. You can also construct the array of :cpp:type:`ledc_fade_param_config_t` manually. Once the fade parameter structs are prepared, a consecutive fading can be configured by passing the pointer to the prepared :cpp:type:`ledc_fade_param_config_t` list and the total number of fade ranges to :cpp:func:`ledc_set_multi_fade`.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    Start fading with :cpp:func:`ledc_fade_start`.

Note that with either fade mode, the next fade or fixed-duty update will not take effect until the last fade finishes or is stopped. :cpp:func:`ledc_fade_stop` has to be called to stop a fade that is in progress.\\n\\nTo get a notification about the completion of a fade operation, a fade end callback function can be registered for each channel by calling :cpp:func:`ledc_cb_register` after the fade service being installed. The fade end callback prototype is defined in :cpp:type:`ledc_cb_t`, where you should return a boolean value from the callback function, indicating whether a high priority task is woken up by this callback function. It is worth mentioning, the callback and the function invoked by itself should be placed in IRAM, as the interrupt service routine is in IRAM. :cpp:func:`ledc_cb_register` will print a warning message if it finds the addresses of callback and user context are incorrect.\\n\\nIf not required anymore, fading and an associated interrupt can be disabled with :cpp:func:`ledc_fade_func_uninstall`.\\n\\n\\n.. _ledc-api-change-pwm-frequency:\\n\\nChange PWM Frequency\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nThe LEDC API provides several ways to change the PWM frequency \"on the fly\":\\n\\n    * Set the frequency by calling :cpp:func:`ledc_set_freq`.

This means that if the timer settings are modified, the changes will be applied automatically on the next overflow interrupt of the timer. In contrast, when updating the low-speed timer, the change of settings should be explicitly triggered by software. The LEDC driver handles it in the background, e.g., when :cpp:func:`ledc_timer_config` or :cpp:func:`ledc_timer_set` is called.\\n\\n    For additional details regarding speed modes, see **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **LED PWM Controller (LEDC)** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#ledpwm>`__].\\n\\n    .. _ledc-api-supported-range-frequency-duty-resolution:\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n    .. _ledc-api-supported-range-frequency-duty-resolution:\\n\\nSupported Range of Frequency and Duty Resolutions\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe LED PWM Controller is designed primarily to drive LEDs. It provides a large flexibility of PWM duty cycle settings. For instance, the PWM frequency of 5 kHz can have the maximum duty resolution of 13 bits. This means that the duty can be set anywhere from 0 to 100% with a resolution of ~ 0.012% (2 ** 13 = 8192 discrete levels of the LED intensity). Note, however, that these parameters depend on the clock signal clocking the LED PWM Controller timer which in turn clocks the channel (see :ref:`timer configuration <ledc-api-configure-timer>` and the **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **LED PWM Controller (LEDC)** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#ledpwm>`__]).\\n\\nThe LEDC can be used for generating signals at much higher frequencies that are sufficient enough to clock other devices, e.g., a digital camera module. In this case, the maximum available frequency is 40 MHz with duty resolution of 1 bit. This means that the duty cycle is fixed at 50% and cannot be adjusted.\\n\\nThe LEDC API is designed to report an error when trying to set a frequency and a duty resolution that exceed the range of LEDC\\'s hardware. For example, an attempt to set the frequency to 20 MHz and the duty resolution to 3 bits results in the following error reported on a serial monitor:\\n\\n.. highlight:: none\\n\\n::\\n\\n    E (196) ledc: requested frequency and duty resolution cannot be achieved, try reducing freq_hz or duty_resolution. div_param=128\\n\\nIn such a situation, either the duty resolution or the frequency must be reduced. For example, setting the duty resolution to 2 resolves this issue and makes it possible to set the duty cycle at 25% steps, i.e., at 25%, 50% or 75%.\\n\\nThe LEDC driver also captures and reports attempts to configure frequency/duty resolution combinations that are below the supported minimum, e.g.,:\\n\\n::\\n\\n    E (196) ledc: requested frequency and duty resolution cannot be achieved, try increasing freq_hz or duty_resolution. div_param=128000000\\n\\nThe duty resolution is normally set using :cpp:type:`ledc_timer_bit_t`. This enumeration covers the range from 10 to 15 bits. If a smaller duty resolution is required (from 10 down to 1), enter the equivalent numeric values directly.\\n\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe LEDC basic example: :example:`peripherals/ledc/ledc_basic`.\\n\\nThe LEDC change duty cycle and fading control example: :example:`peripherals/ledc/ledc_fade`.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_LEDC_GAMMA_CURVE_FADE_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    The LEDC color control with Gamma correction on RGB LED example: :example:`peripherals/ledc/ledc_gamma_curve_fade`.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/ledc.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/ledc_types.inc\\n',\n",

TinyUSB is integrated with ESP-IDF to provide USB features of the framework. Using this driver the chip works as simple or composite device supporting several USB devices simultaneously.\\n\\nTinyUSB stack is distributed via `IDF Component Registry <https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp_tinyusb>`__.\\n\\nOur USB-OTG implementation is limited to {IDF_TARGET_USB_EP_NUM} USB endpoints ({IDF_TARGET_USB_EP_NUM_INOUT} IN/OUT endpoints and {IDF_TARGET_USB_EP_NUM_IN} IN endpoint) . Please note that enabling Secure Boot or flash encryption disables the USB-OTG USB stack in the ROM, disallowing updates via the serial emulation or Device Firmware Update (DFU) on that port.

For more details, please refer to `IDF Component Registry <https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp_tinyusb>`__.\\n\\n.. code:: bash\\n\\n  idf.py add-dependency esp_tinyusb\\n\\nVia Menuconfig options you can specify:\\n\\n- Several descriptor\\'s parameters (see Descriptors Configuration below)\\n- USB Serial low-level configuration\\n- The verbosity of the TinyUSB\\'s log\\n- Disable the TinyUSB main task (for the custom implementation)\\n\\nDescriptors Configuration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe driver\\'s descriptors are provided by :cpp:type:`tinyusb_config_t` structure\\'s :cpp:member:`device_descriptor`, :cpp:member:`configuration_descriptor` and :cpp:member:`string_descriptor` members. Therefore, you should initialize :cpp:type:`tinyusb_config_t` with your desired descriptors before calling :cpp:func:`tinyusb_driver_install` to install the driver.\\n\\nHowever, the driver also provides default descriptors. You can install the driver with default device and string descriptors by setting the :cpp:member:`device_descriptor` and :cpp:member:`string_descriptor` members of :cpp:type:`tinyusb_config_t` to `NULL` before calling :cpp:func:`tinyusb_driver_install`. To lower your development effort we also provide default configuration descriptor for CDC and MSC class, as these classes rarely require custom configuration. The driver\\'s default device descriptor is specified using Menuconfig, where the following fields should be configured:\\n\\n- PID\\n- VID\\n- bcdDevice\\n- Manufacturer\\n- Product name\\n- Name of CDC or MSC device if it is On\\n- Serial number\\n\\nIf you want to use your own descriptors with extended modification, you can define them during the driver installation process.\\n\\nInstall Driver\\n--------------\\n\\nTo initialize the driver, users should call :cpp:func:`tinyusb_driver_install`. The driver\\'s configuration is specified in a :cpp:type:`tinyusb_config_t` structure that is passed as an argument to :cpp:func:`tinyusb_driver_install`.\\n\\n Note that the :cpp:type:`tinyusb_config_t` structure can be zero initialized (e.g., ``const tinyusb_config_t tusb_cfg = { 0 };``) or partially (as shown below). For any member that is initialized to `0` or `NULL`, the driver will use its default configuration values for that member (see example below)\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    const tinyusb_config_t partial_init = {\\n        .device_descriptor = NULL,  // Use default device descriptor specified in Menuconfig\\n        .string_descriptor = NULL,  // Use default string descriptors specified in Menuconfig\\n        .external_phy = false,      // Use internal USB PHY\\n        .configuration_descriptor = NULL, // Use default configuration descriptor according to settings in Menuconfig\\n    };\\n\\n.. _self-powered-device:\\n\\nSelf-Powered Device\\n-------------------\\n\\nUSB specification mandates self-powered devices to monitor voltage level on USB\\'s VBUS signal. As opposed to bus-powered devices, a self-powered device can be fully functional even without USB connection. The self-powered device detects connection and disconnection events by monitoring the VBUS voltage level. VBUS is considered valid if it rises above 4.75 V and invalid if it falls below 4.35 V.\\n\\nNo {IDF_TARGET_NAME} pin is 5 V tolerant, so you must connect the VBUS to {IDF_TARGET_NAME} via a comparator with voltage thresholds as described above, or use a simple resistor voltage divider that will output (0.75 x Vdd) if VBUS is 4.4 V (see figure below). In both cases, voltage on the sensing pin must be logic low within 3 ms after the device is unplugged from USB host.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/diagrams/usb/usb_vbus_voltage_monitor.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Simple voltage divider for VBUS monitoring\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Simple voltage divider for VBUS monitoring\\n\\nTo use this feature, in :cpp:type:`tinyusb_config_t` you must set :cpp:member:`self_powered` to ``true`` and :cpp:member:`vbus_monitor_io` to GPIO number that will be used for VBUS monitoring.\\n\\nUSB Serial Device (CDC-ACM)\\n---------------------------\\n\\nIf the CDC option is enabled in Menuconfig, the USB Serial Device can be initialized with :cpp:func:`tusb_cdc_acm_init` according to the settings from :cpp:type:`tinyusb_config_cdcacm_t` (see example below).\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    const tinyusb_config_cdcacm_t acm_cfg = {\\n        .usb_dev = TINYUSB_USBDEV_0,\\n        .cdc_port = TINYUSB_CDC_ACM_0,\\n        .rx_unread_buf_sz = 64,\\n        .callback_rx = NULL,\\n        .callback_rx_wanted_char = NULL,\\n        .callback_line_state_changed = NULL,\\n        .callback_line_coding_changed = NULL\\n    };\\n    tusb_cdc_acm_init(&acm_cfg);\\n\\nTo specify callbacks you can either set the pointer to your :cpp:type:`tusb_cdcacm_callback_t` function in the configuration structure or call :cpp:func:`tinyusb_cdcacm_register_callback` after initialization.\\n\\nUSB Serial Console\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe driver allows to redirect all standard application streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) to the USB Serial Device and return them to UART using :cpp:func:`esp_tusb_init_console`/:cpp:func:`esp_tusb_deinit_console` functions.\\n\\nUSB Mass Storage Device (MSC)\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nIf the MSC CONFIG_TINYUSB_MSC_ENABLED option is enabled in Menuconfig, the ESP Chip can be used as USB MSC Device.

       " \"Pulse Counter (PCNT)\\n====================\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nThe PCNT (Pulse Counter) module is designed to count the number of rising and/or falling edges of input signals. The {IDF_TARGET_NAME} contains multiple pulse counter units in the module. [1]_ Each unit is in effect an independent counter with multiple channels, where each channel can increment/decrement the counter on a rising/falling edge. Furthermore, each channel can be configured separately.\\n\\nPCNT channels can react to signals of **edge** type and **level** type, however for simple applications, detecting the edge signal is usually sufficient. PCNT channels can be configured react to both pulse edges (i.e., rising and falling edge), and can be configured to increase, decrease or do nothing to the unit's counter on each edge. The level signal is the so-called **control signal**, which is used to control the counting mode of the edge signals that are attached to the same channel. By combining the usage of both edge and level signals, a PCNT unit can act as a **quadrature decoder**.\\n\\nBesides that, PCNT unit is equipped with a separate glitch filter, which is helpful to remove noise from the signal.\\n\\nTypically, a PCNT module can be used in scenarios like:\\n\\n- Calculate periodic signal's frequency by counting the pulse numbers within a time slice\\n- Decode quadrature signals into speed and direction\\n\\nFunctional Overview\\n-------------------\\n\\nDescription of the PCNT functionality is divided into the following sections:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - :ref:`pcnt-resource-allocation` - covers how to allocate PCNT units and channels with properly set of configurations. It also covers how to recycle the resources when they finished working.\\n    - :ref:`pcnt-setup-channel-actions` - covers how to configure the PCNT channel to behave on different signal edges and levels.\\n    - :ref:`pcnt-watch-points` - describes how to configure PCNT watch points (i.e., tell PCNT unit to trigger an event when the count reaches a certain value).\\n    - :ref:`pcnt-register-event-callbacks` - describes how to hook your specific code to the watch point event callback function.\\n    - :ref:`pcnt-set-glitch-filter` - describes how to enable and set the timing parameters for the internal glitch filter.\\n    :SOC_PCNT_SUPPORT_CLEAR_SIGNAL: - :ref:`pcnt-set-clear-signal` - describes how to set the parameters for the external clear signal.\\n    - :ref:`pcnt-enable-disable-unit` - describes how to enable and disable the PCNT unit.\\n    - :ref:`pcnt-unit-io-control` - describes IO control functions of PCNT unit, like enable glitch filter, start and stop unit, get and clear count value.\\n    - :ref:`pcnt-power-management` - describes what functionality will prevent the chip from going into low power mode.\\n    - :ref:`pcnt-iram-safe` - describes tips on how to make the PCNT interrupt and IO control functions work better along with a disabled cache.\\n    - :ref:`pcnt-thread-safe` - lists which APIs are guaranteed to be thread safe by the driver.\\n    - :ref:`pcnt-kconfig-options` - lists the supported Kconfig options that can be used to make a different effect on driver behavior.\\n\\n.. _pcnt-resource-allocation:\\n\\nResource Allocation\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe PCNT unit and channel are represented by :cpp:type:`pcnt_unit_handle_t` and :cpp:type:`pcnt_channel_handle_t` respectively. All available units and channels are maintained by the driver in a resource pool, so you do not need to know the exact underlying instance ID.\\n\\nInstall PCNT Unit\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nTo install a PCNT unit, there is a configuration structure that needs to be given in advance: :cpp:type:`pcnt_unit_config_t`:\\n\\n-  :cpp:member:`pcnt_unit_config_t::low_limit` and :cpp:member:`pcnt_unit_config_t::high_limit` specify the range for the internal hardware counter. The counter will reset to zero automatically when it crosses either the high or low limit.\\n-  :cpp:member:`pcnt_unit_config_t::accum_count` sets whether to create an internal accumulator for the counter. This is helpful when you want to extend the counter's width, which by default is 16 bit at most, defined in the hardware. See also :ref:`pcnt-compensate-overflow-loss` for how to use this feature to compensate the overflow loss.\\n-  :cpp:member:`pcnt_unit_config_t::intr_priority` sets the priority of the interrupt. If it is set to ``0``, the driver will allocate an interrupt with a default priority. Otherwise, the driver will use the given priority.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Since all PCNT units share the same interrupt source, when installing multiple PCNT units make sure that the interrupt priority :cpp:member:`pcnt_unit_config_t::intr_priority` is the same for each unit.\\n\\nUnit allocation and initialization is done by calling a function :cpp:func:`pcnt_new_unit` with :cpp:type:`pcnt_unit_config_t` as an input parameter. The function will return a PCNT unit handle only when it runs correctly. Specifically, when there are no more free PCNT units in the pool (i.e., unit resources have been used up), then this function will return :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error. The total number of available PCNT units is recorded by :c:macro:`SOC_PCNT_UNITS_PER_GROUP` for reference.\\n\\nIf a previously created PCNT unit is no longer needed, it is recommended to recycle the resource by calling :cpp:func:`pcnt_del_unit`. Which in return allows the underlying unit hardware to be used for other purposes. Before deleting a PCNT unit, one should ensure the following prerequisites:\\n\\n- The unit is in the init state, in other words, the unit is either disabled by :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_disable` or not enabled yet.\\n- The attached PCNT channels are all removed by :cpp:func:`pcnt_del_channel`.\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    #define EXAMPLE_PCNT_HIGH_LIMIT 100\\n    #define EXAMPLE_PCNT_LOW_LIMIT  -100\\n\\n    pcnt_unit_config_t unit_config = {\\n        .high_limit = EXAMPLE_PCNT_HIGH_LIMIT,\\n        .low_limit = EXAMPLE_PCNT_LOW_LIMIT,\\n    };\\n    pcnt_unit_handle_t pcnt_unit = NULL;\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(pcnt_new_unit(&unit_config, &pcnt_unit));\\n\\nInstall PCNT Channel\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nTo install a PCNT channel, you must initialize a :cpp:type:`pcnt_chan_config_t` structure in advance, and then call :cpp:func:`pcnt_new_channel`. The configuration fields of the :cpp:type:`pcnt_chan_config_t` structure are described below:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`pcnt_chan_config_t::edge_gpio_num` and :cpp:member:`pcnt_chan_config_t::level_gpio_num` specify the GPIO numbers used by **edge** type signal and **level** type signal. Please note, either of them can be assigned to ``-1`` if it is not actually used, and thus it will become a **virtual IO**. For some simple pulse counting applications where one of the level/edge signals is fixed (i.e., never changes), you can reclaim a GPIO by setting the signal as a virtual IO on channel allocation. Setting the level/edge signal as a virtual IO causes that signal to be internally routed to a fixed High/Low logic level, thus allowing you to save a GPIO for other purposes.\\n- :cpp:member:`pcnt_chan_config_t::virt_edge_io_level` and :cpp:member:`pcnt_chan_config_t::virt_level_io_level` specify the virtual IO level for **edge** and **level** input signal, to ensure a deterministic state for such control signal. Please note, they are only valid when either :cpp:member:`pcnt_chan_config_t::edge_gpio_num` or :cpp:member:`pcnt_chan_config_t::level_gpio_num` is assigned to ``-1``.\\n- :cpp:member:`pcnt_chan_config_t::invert_edge_input` and :cpp:member:`pcnt_chan_config_t::invert_level_input` are used to decide whether to invert the input signals before they going into PCNT hardware. The invert is done by GPIO matrix instead of PCNT hardware.\\n- :cpp:member:`pcnt_chan_config_t::io_loop_back` is for debug only, which enables both the GPIO's input and output paths. This can help to simulate the pulse signals by function :cpp:func:`gpio_set_level` on the same GPIO.\\n\\nChannel allocating and initialization is done by calling a function :cpp:func:`pcnt_new_channel` with the above :cpp:type:`pcnt_chan_config_t` as an input parameter plus a PCNT unit handle returned from :cpp:func:`pcnt_new_unit`. This function will return a PCNT channel handle if it runs correctly. Specifically, when there are no more free PCNT channel within the unit (i.e., channel resources have been used up), then this function will return :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error. The total number of available PCNT channels within the unit is recorded by :c:macro:`SOC_PCNT_CHANNELS_PER_UNIT` for reference. Note that, when install a PCNT channel for a specific unit, one should ensure the unit is in the init state, otherwise this function will return :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` error.\\n\\nIf a previously created PCNT channel is no longer needed, it is recommended to recycle the resources by calling :cpp:func:`pcnt_del_channel`.

You can set different actions for edge signal and/or level signal.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`pcnt_channel_set_edge_action` function is to set specific actions for rising and falling edge of the signal attached to the :cpp:member:`pcnt_chan_config_t::edge_gpio_num`. Supported actions are listed in :cpp:type:`pcnt_channel_edge_action_t`.\\n- :cpp:func:`pcnt_channel_set_level_action` function is to set specific actions for high and low level of the signal attached to the :cpp:member:`pcnt_chan_config_t::level_gpio_num`. Supported actions are listed in :cpp:type:`pcnt_channel_level_action_t`. This function is not mandatory if the :cpp:member:`pcnt_chan_config_t::level_gpio_num` is set to ``-1`` when allocating PCNT channel by :cpp:func:`pcnt_new_channel`.\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    // decrease the counter on rising edge, increase the counter on falling edge\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(pcnt_channel_set_edge_action(pcnt_chan, PCNT_CHANNEL_EDGE_ACTION_DECREASE, PCNT_CHANNEL_EDGE_ACTION_INCREASE));\\n    // keep the counting mode when the control signal is high level, and reverse the counting mode when the control signal is low level\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(pcnt_channel_set_level_action(pcnt_chan, PCNT_CHANNEL_LEVEL_ACTION_KEEP, PCNT_CHANNEL_LEVEL_ACTION_INVERSE));\\n\\n.. _pcnt-watch-points:\\n\\nWatch Points\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nEach PCNT unit can be configured to watch several different values that you are interested in. The value to be watched is also called **Watch Point**. The watch point itself can not exceed the range set in :cpp:type:`pcnt_unit_config_t` by :cpp:member:`pcnt_unit_config_t::low_limit` and :cpp:member:`pcnt_unit_config_t::high_limit`. When the counter reaches either watch point, a watch event will be triggered and notify you by interrupt if any watch event callback has ever registered in :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_register_event_callbacks`. See :ref:`pcnt-register-event-callbacks` for how to register event callbacks.\\n\\nThe watch point can be added and removed by :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_add_watch_point` and :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_remove_watch_point`. The commonly-used watch points are: **zero cross**, **maximum/minimum count** and other threshold values. The number of available watch point is limited, :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_add_watch_point` will return error :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` if it can not find any free hardware resource to save the watch point. You can not add the same watch point for multiple times, otherwise it will return error :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE`.\\n\\nIt is recommended to remove the unused watch point by :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_remove_watch_point` to recycle the watch point resources.\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    // add zero across watch point\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(pcnt_unit_add_watch_point(pcnt_unit, 0));\\n    // add high limit watch point\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(pcnt_unit_add_watch_point(pcnt_unit, EXAMPLE_PCNT_HIGH_LIMIT));\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_PCNT_SUPPORT_RUNTIME_THRES_UPDATE\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Due to the hardware limitation, after adding a watch point, you should call :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_clear_count` to make it take effect.\\n\\n.. _pcnt-register-event-callbacks:\\n\\nRegister Event Callbacks\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen PCNT unit reaches any enabled watch point, specific event will be generated and notify the CPU by interrupt. If you have some function that want to get executed when event happens, you should hook your function to the interrupt service routine by calling :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_register_event_callbacks`. All supported event callbacks are listed in the :cpp:type:`pcnt_event_callbacks_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`pcnt_event_callbacks_t::on_reach` sets a callback function for watch point event. As this function is called within the ISR context, you must ensure that the function does not attempt to block (e.g., by making sure that only FreeRTOS APIs with ``ISR`` suffix are called from within the function). The function prototype is declared in :cpp:type:`pcnt_watch_cb_t`.\\n\\nYou can save their own context to :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_register_event_callbacks` as well, via the parameter ``user_ctx``. This user data will be directly passed to the callback functions.\\n\\nIn the callback function, the driver will fill in the event data of specific event. For example, the watch point event data is declared as :cpp:type:`pcnt_watch_event_data_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`pcnt_watch_event_data_t::watch_point_value` saves the watch point value that triggers the event.\\n- :cpp:member:`pcnt_watch_event_data_t::zero_cross_mode` saves how the PCNT unit crosses the zero point in the latest time. The possible zero cross modes are listed in the :cpp:type:`pcnt_unit_zero_cross_mode_t`. Usually different zero cross mode means different **counting direction** and **counting step size**.\\n\\nRegistering callback function results in lazy installation of interrupt service, thus this function should only be called before the unit is enabled by :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_enable`. Otherwise, it can return :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` error.\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    static bool example_pcnt_on_reach(pcnt_unit_handle_t unit, const pcnt_watch_event_data_t *edata, void *user_ctx)\\n    {\\n        BaseType_t high_task_wakeup;\\n        QueueHandle_t queue = (QueueHandle_t)user_ctx;\\n        // send watch point to queue, from this interrupt callback\\n        xQueueSendFromISR(queue, &(edata->watch_point_value), &high_task_wakeup);\\n        // return whether a high priority task has been waken up by this function\\n        return (high_task_wakeup == pdTRUE);\\n    }\\n\\n    pcnt_event_callbacks_t cbs = {\\n        .on_reach = example_pcnt_on_reach,\\n    };\\n    QueueHandle_t queue = xQueueCreate(10, sizeof(int));\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(pcnt_unit_register_event_callbacks(pcnt_unit, &cbs, queue));\\n\\n.. _pcnt-set-glitch-filter:\\n\\nSet Glitch Filter\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe PCNT unit features filters to ignore possible short glitches in the signals. The parameters that can be configured for the glitch filter are listed in :cpp:type:`pcnt_glitch_filter_config_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`pcnt_glitch_filter_config_t::max_glitch_ns` sets the maximum glitch width, in nano seconds. If a signal pulse's width is smaller than this value, then it will be treated as noise and will not increase/decrease the internal counter.\\n\\nYou can enable the glitch filter for PCNT unit by calling :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_set_glitch_filter` with the filter configuration provided above. Particularly, you can disable the glitch filter later by calling :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_set_glitch_filter` with a ``NULL`` filter configuration.\\n\\nThis function should be called when the unit is in the init state. Otherwise, it will return :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` error.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The glitch filter is clocked from APB. For the counter not to miss any pulses, the maximum glitch width should be longer than one APB_CLK cycle (usually 12.5 ns if APB equals 80 MHz). As the APB frequency would be changed after DFS (Dynamic Frequency Scaling) enabled, which means the filter does not work as expect in that case. So the driver installs a PM lock for PCNT unit during the first time you enable the glitch filter. For more information related to power management strategy used in PCNT driver, please see :ref:`pcnt-power-management`.\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    pcnt_glitch_filter_config_t filter_config = {\\n        .max_glitch_ns = 1000,\\n    };\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(pcnt_unit_set_glitch_filter(pcnt_unit, &filter_config));\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_PCNT_SUPPORT_CLEAR_SIGNAL\\n\\n    .. _pcnt-set-clear-signal:\\n\\n    Use External Clear Signal\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The PCNT unit can receive a clear signal from the GPIO. The parameters that can be configured for the clear signal are listed in :cpp:type:`pcnt_clear_signal_config_t`:\\n\\n        -  :cpp:member:`pcnt_clear_signal_config_t::clear_signal_gpio_num` specify the GPIO numbers used by **clear** signal. The default active level is high, and the input mode is pull-down enabled.\\n        -  :cpp:member:`pcnt_clear_signal_config_t::invert_clear_signal` is used to decide whether to invert the input signal before it going into PCNT hardware. The invert is done by GPIO matrix instead of PCNT hardware. The input mode is pull-up enabled when the input signal is inverted.\\n        -  :cpp:member:`pcnt_clear_signal_config_t::io_loop_back` is for debug only, which enables both the GPIO's input and output paths. This can help to simulate the clear signal by function :cpp:func:`gpio_set_level` for the same GPIO.\\n\\n    This signal acts in the same way as calling :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_clear_count`, but is not subject to software latency, and is suitable for use in situations with low latency requirements. Also please note, the flip frequency of this signal can not be too high.\\n\\n    .. code:: c\\n\\n        pcnt_clear_signal_config_t clear_signal_config = {\\n            .clear_signal_gpio_num = PCNT_CLEAR_SIGNAL_GPIO,\\n        };\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK(pcnt_unit_set_clear_signal(pcnt_unit, &clear_signal_config));\\n\\n    .. _pcnt-enable-disable-unit:\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_PCNT_SUPPORT_CLEAR_SIGNAL\\n\\n    .. _pcnt-enable-disable-unit:\\n\\nEnable and Disable Unit\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBefore doing IO control to the PCNT unit, you need to enable it first, by calling :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_enable`. Internally, this function:\\n\\n* switches the PCNT driver state from **init** to **enable**.\\n* enables the interrupt service if it has been lazy installed in :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_register_event_callbacks`.\\n* acquires a proper power management lock if it has been lazy installed in :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_set_glitch_filter`. See also :ref:`pcnt-power-management` for more information.\\n\\nOn the contrary, calling :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_disable` will do the opposite, that is, put the PCNT driver back to the **init** state, disable the interrupts service and release the power management lock.\\n\\n.. code::c\\n\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(pcnt_unit_enable(pcnt_unit));\\n\\n.. _pcnt-unit-io-control:\\n\\nUnit IO Control\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nStart/Stop and Clear\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nCalling :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_start` makes the PCNT unit start to work, increase or decrease counter according to pulse signals. On the contrary, calling :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_stop` will stop the PCNT unit but retain current count value. Instead, clearing counter can only be done by calling :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_clear_count`.\\n\\nNote, :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_start` and :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_stop` should be called when the unit has been enabled by :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_enable`. Otherwise, it will return :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` error.\\n\\n.. code::c\\n\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(pcnt_unit_clear_count(pcnt_unit));\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(pcnt_unit_start(pcnt_unit));\\n\\nGet Count Value\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nYou can read current count value at any time by calling :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_get_count`. The returned count value is a **signed** integer, where the sign can be used to reflect the direction.\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    int pulse_count = 0;\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(pcnt_unit_get_count(pcnt_unit, &pulse_count));\\n\\n.. _pcnt-compensate-overflow-loss:\\n\\nCompensate Overflow Loss\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe internal hardware counter will be cleared to zero automatically when it reaches high or low limit. If you want to compensate for that count loss and extend the counter's bit-width, you can:\\n\\n    1. Enable :cpp:member:`pcnt_unit_config_t::accum_count` when installing the PCNT unit.\\n    2. Add the high/low limit as the :ref:`pcnt-watch-points`.\\n    3. Now, the returned count value from the :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_get_count` function not only reflects the hardware's count value, but also accumulates the high/low overflow loss to it.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_clear_count` resets the accumulated count value as well.\\n\\n.. _pcnt-power-management:\\n\\nPower Management\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen power management is enabled (i.e., :ref:`CONFIG_PM_ENABLE` is on), the system will adjust the APB frequency before going into light sleep, thus potentially changing the behavior of PCNT glitch filter and leading to valid signal being treated as noise.\\n\\nHowever, the driver can prevent the system from changing APB frequency by acquiring a power management lock of type :cpp:enumerator:`ESP_PM_APB_FREQ_MAX`. Whenever you enable the glitch filter by :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_set_glitch_filter`, the driver guarantees that the power management lock is acquired after the PCNT unit is enabled by :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_enable`. Likewise, the driver releases the lock after :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_disable` is called.\\n\\n.. _pcnt-iram-safe:\\n\\nIRAM Safe\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy default, the PCNT interrupt will be deferred when the Cache is disabled for reasons like writing/erasing Flash. Thus the alarm interrupt will not get executed in time, which is not expected in a real-time application.\\n\\nThere is a Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_PCNT_ISR_IRAM_SAFE` that:\\n\\n1. Enables the interrupt being serviced even when cache is disabled\\n2. Places all functions that used by the ISR into IRAM [2]_\\n3. Places driver object into DRAM (in case it is mapped to PSRAM by accident)\\n\\nThis allows the interrupt to run while the cache is disabled but comes at the cost of increased IRAM consumption.\\n\\nThere is another Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_PCNT_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM` that can put commonly used IO control functions into IRAM as well. So that these functions can also be executable when the cache is disabled. These IO control functions are as follows:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_start`\\n- :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_stop`\\n- :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_clear_count`\\n- :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_get_count`\\n\\n.. _pcnt-thread-safe:\\n\\nThread Safety\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe factory functions :cpp:func:`pcnt_new_unit`  and :cpp:func:`pcnt_new_channel` are guaranteed to be thread safe by the driver, which means, you can call them from different RTOS tasks without protection by extra locks.\\n\\nThe following functions are allowed to run under ISR context, the driver uses a critical section to prevent them being called concurrently in both task and ISR.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_start`\\n- :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_stop`\\n- :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_clear_count`\\n- :cpp:func:`pcnt_unit_get_count`\\n\\nOther functions that take the :cpp:type:`pcnt_unit_handle_t` and :cpp:type:`pcnt_channel_handle_t` as the first positional parameter, are not treated as thread safe. This means you should avoid calling them from multiple tasks.\\n\\n.. _pcnt-kconfig-options:\\n\\nKconfig Options\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_PCNT_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM` controls where to place the PCNT control functions (IRAM or Flash), see :ref:`pcnt-iram-safe` for more information.\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_PCNT_ISR_IRAM_SAFE` controls whether the default ISR handler can work when cache is disabled, see :ref:`pcnt-iram-safe` for more information.\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_PCNT_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG` is used to enabled the debug log output. Enabling this option increases the firmware binary size.\\n\\nApplication Examples\\n--------------------\\n\\n* Decode the quadrature signals from rotary encoder: :example:`peripherals/pcnt/rotary_encoder`.\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/pulse_cnt.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/pcnt_types.inc\\n\\n..

       " 'Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)\\n=============================================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nHash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) is a secure authentication technique that verifies the authenticity and integrity of a message with a pre-shared key. This module provides hardware acceleration for SHA256-HMAC generation using a key burned into an eFuse block.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on the application workflow and the HMAC calculation process, see **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **HMAC Accelerator (HMAC)** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#hmac>`__].\\n\\nGeneralized Application Scheme\\n------------------------------\\n\\nLet there be two parties, A and B. They want to verify the authenticity and integrity of messages sent between each other. Before they can start sending messages, they need to exchange the secret key via a secure channel.\\n\\nTo verify A\\'s messages, B can do the following:\\n\\n- A calculates the HMAC of the message it wants to send.\\n- A sends the message and the HMAC to B.\\n- B calculates the HMAC of the received message itself.\\n- B checks whether the received and calculated HMACs match.\\n\\nIf they do match, the message is authentic.\\n\\nHowever, the HMAC itself is not bound to this use case. It can also be used for challenge-response protocols supporting HMAC or as a key input for further security modules (see below), etc.\\n\\nHMAC on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nOn {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, the HMAC module works with a secret key burnt into the eFuses. This eFuse key can be made completely inaccessible for any resources outside the cryptographic modules, thus avoiding key leakage.\\n\\nFurthermore, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has three different application scenarios for its HMAC module:\\n\\n#. HMAC is generated for software use\\n#. HMAC is used as a key for the Digital Signature (DS) module\\n#. HMAC is used for enabling the soft-disabled JTAG interface\\n\\nThe first mode is called **Upstream** mode, while the last two modes are called **Downstream** modes.\\n\\neFuse Keys for HMAC\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSix physical eFuse blocks can be used as keys for the HMAC module: block 4 ~ block 9. The enum :cpp:enum:`hmac_key_id_t` in the API maps them to ``HMAC_KEY0`` ~ ``HMAC_KEY5``.\\n\\nEach key has a corresponding eFuse parameter **key purpose** determining for which of the three HMAC application scenarios (see below) the key may be used:\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n   :widths: 15 70\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n\\n   * - Key Purpose\\n     - Application Scenario\\n   * - 8\\n     - HMAC generated for software use\\n   * - 7\\n     - HMAC used as a key for the Digital Signature (DS) module\\n   * - 6\\n     - HMAC used for enabling the soft-disabled JTAG interface\\n   * - 5\\n     - HMAC both as a key for the DS module and for enabling JTAG\\n\\nThis is to prevent the usage of a key for a different function than originally intended.\\n\\nTo calculate an HMAC, the software has to provide the ID of the key block containing the secret key as well as the **key purpose** (see **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **eFuse Controller (eFuse)** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#efuse>`__]).\\n\\nBefore the HMAC key calculation, the HMAC module looks up the purpose of the provided key block. The calculation only proceeds if the purpose of the provided key block matches the purpose stored in the eFuses of the key block provided by the ID.\\n\\nHMAC Generation for Software\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nKey purpose value: 8\\n\\nIn this case, the HMAC is given out to the software, e.g., to authenticate a message.\\n\\nThe API to calculate the HMAC is :cpp:func:`esp_hmac_calculate`. The input arguments for the function are the message, message length, and the eFuse key block ID which contains the secret and has the efuse key purpose set to Upstream mode.\\n\\nHMAC for Digital Signature\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nKey purpose values: 7, 5\\n\\nThe HMAC can be used as a key derivation function to decrypt private key parameters which are used by the Digital Signature module. A standard message is used by the hardware in that case. You only need to provide the eFuse key block and purpose on the HMAC side, additional parameters are required for the Digital Signature component in that case.\\n\\nNeither the key nor the actual HMAC is ever exposed outside the HMAC module and DS component. The calculation of the HMAC and its handover to the DS component happen internally.\\n\\nFor more details, see **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **Digital Signature (DS)** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#digsig>`__].\\n\\n.. _hmac_for_enabling_jtag:\\n\\nHMAC for Enabling JTAG\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nKey purpose values: 6, 5\\n\\nThe third application is using the HMAC as a key to enable JTAG if it was soft-disabled before.\\n\\nFollowing is the procedure to re-enable the JTAG:\\n\\n**Stage 1: Setup**\\n\\n1. Generate a 256-bit HMAC secret key to use for JTAG re-enable.\\n2. Write the key to an eFuse block with key purpose HMAC_DOWN_ALL (5) or HMAC_DOWN_JTAG (6). This can be done using the ``esp_efuse_write_key()`` function in the firmware or using ``espefuse.py`` from the host.\\n3. Configure the eFuse key block to be read-protected using the ``esp_efuse_set_read_protect()``, so that software cannot read back the value.\\n4. Burn the ``soft JTAG disable`` bit/bits on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. This will permanently disable JTAG unless the correct key value is provided by the software.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s2\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n      The API **esp_efuse_write_field_bit(ESP_EFUSE_SOFT_DIS_JTAG)** can be used to burn ``soft JTAG disable`` bit on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32s2\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n      The API **esp_efuse_write_field_cnt(ESP_EFUSE_SOFT_DIS_JTAG, ESP_EFUSE_SOFT_DIS_JTAG[0]->bit_count)** can be used to burn ``soft JTAG disable`` bits on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s2 or esp32s3\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n      If ``HARD_DIS_JTAG`` eFuse is set, then ``SOFT_DIS_JTAG`` functionality does not work because JTAG is permanently disabled.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32s2 and not esp32s3\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n      If ``DIS_PAD_JTAG`` eFuse is set, then ``SOFT_DIS_JTAG`` functionality does not work because JTAG is permanently disabled.\\n\\nJTAG enables\\n\\n1. The key to re-enable JTAG is the output of the HMAC-SHA256 function using the secret key in eFuse and 32 ``0x00`` bytes as the message.\\n2. Pass this key value when calling the :cpp:func:`esp_hmac_jtag_enable` function from the firmware.\\n3. To re-disable JTAG in the firmware, reset the system or call :cpp:func:`esp_hmac_jtag_disable`.\\n\\nEnd-to-end example of soft disable and re-enable JTAG workflow: :example:`security/hmac_soft_jtag`\\n\\nFor more details, see **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **HMAC Accelerator (HMAC)** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#hmac>`__].\\n\\n\\nApplication Outline\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe following code is an outline of how to set an eFuse key and then use it to calculate an HMAC for software usage.\\n\\nWe use ``esp_efuse_write_key`` to set physical key block 4 in the eFuse for the HMAC module together with its purpose. ``ESP_EFUSE_KEY_PURPOSE_HMAC_UP`` (8) means that this key can only be used for HMAC generation for software usage:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    #include \"esp_efuse.h\"\\n\\n    const uint8_t key_data[32] = { ... };\\n\\n    esp_err_t status = esp_efuse_write_key(EFUSE_BLK_KEY4,\\n                        ESP_EFUSE_KEY_PURPOSE_HMAC_UP,\\n                        key_data, sizeof(key_data));\\n\\n    if (status == ESP_OK) {\\n        // written key\\n    } else {\\n        // writing key failed, maybe written already\\n    }\\n\\nNow we can use the saved key to calculate an HMAC for software usage.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    #include \"esp_hmac.h\"\\n\\n    uint8_t hmac[32];\\n\\n    const char *message = \"Hello, HMAC!\";\\n    const size_t msg_len = 12;\\n\\n    esp_err_t result = esp_hmac_calculate(HMAC_KEY4, message, msg_len, hmac);\\n\\n    if (result == ESP_OK) {\\n        // HMAC written to hmac now\\n    } else {\\n        // failure calculating HMAC\\n    }\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_hmac.inc\\n',\n",

During ECDSA signature creation, the algorithm requires a random integer to be generated as specified in the `RFC 6090 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6090>`_ section 5.3.2.\\n\\nPlease ensure that hardware :doc:`RNG <../system/random>` is enabled before starting ECDSA computations (primarily signing) in the application.\\n\\nApplication Outline\\n-------------------\\n\\nPlease refer to the :ref:`ecdsa-peri-with-esp-tls` guide for details on how-to use ECDSA peripheral for establishing a mutually authenticated TLS connection.\\n\\nThe ECDSA peripheral in mbedTLS stack is integrated by overriding the ECDSA sign and verify APIs. Please note that, the ECDSA peripheral does not support all curves or hash algorithms and hence for cases where the requirements do not meet the hardware, implementation falls back to the software.\\n\\nFor a particular TLS context, additional APIs have been supplied to populate certain fields (e.g., private key ctx) to differentiate routing to hardware. ESP-TLS layer integrates these APIs internally and hence no additional work is required at the application layer.

       " \"Event Task Matrix (ETM)\\n=======================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nNormally, if a peripheral X needs to notify peripheral Y of a particular event, this could only be done via a CPU interrupt from peripheral X, where the CPU notifies peripheral Y on behalf of peripheral X. However, in time-critical applications, the latency introduced by CPU interrupts is non-negligible.\\n\\nWith the help of the Event Task Matrix (ETM) module, some peripherals can directly notify other peripherals of events through pre-set connections without the intervention of CPU interrupts. This allows precise and low latency synchronization between peripherals, and lessens the CPU's workload as the CPU no longer needs to handle these events.\\n\\n.. blockdiag:: /../_static/diagrams/etm/etm_channel.diag\\n    :caption: ETM channels Overview\\n    :align: center\\n\\nThe ETM module has multiple programmable channels, they are used to connect a particular **Event** to a particular **Task**. When an event is activated, the ETM channel will trigger the corresponding task automatically.\\n\\nPeripherals that support ETM functionality provide their or unique set of events and tasks to be connected by the ETM. An ETM channel can connect any event to any task, even looping back an event to a task on the same peripheral. However, an ETM channel can only connect one event to one task at a time (i.e., 1 to 1 relation). If you want to use different events to trigger the same task, you can set up more ETM channels.\\n\\nTypically, with the help of the ETM module, you can implement features like:\\n\\n-  Toggle the GPIO when a timer alarm event happens\\n-  Start an ADC conversion when a pulse edge is detected on a GPIO\\n\\nFunctional Overview\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe following sections of this document cover the typical steps to configure and use the ETM module.\\n\\n- :ref:`etm-channel-allocation` - describes how to install and uninstall the ETM channel.\\n- :ref:`etm-event` - describes how to allocate a new ETM event handle or fetch an existing handle from various peripherals.\\n- :ref:`etm-task` - describes how to allocate a new ETM task handle or fetch an existing handle from various peripherals.\\n- :ref:`etm-channel-control` - describes common ETM channel control functions.\\n- :ref:`etm-thread-safety` - lists which APIs are guaranteed to be thread-safe by the driver.\\n- :ref:`etm-kconfig-options` - lists the supported Kconfig options that can be used to make a different effect on driver behavior.\\n\\n.. _etm-channel-allocation:\\n\\nETM Channel Allocation\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThere are many identical ETM channels in {IDF_TARGET_NAME} [1]_, and each channel is represented by :cpp:type:`esp_etm_channel_handle_t` in the software. The ETM core driver manages all available hardware resources in a pool so that you do not need to care about which channel is in use and which is not. The ETM core driver will allocate a channel for you when you call :cpp:func:`esp_etm_new_channel` and delete it when you call :cpp:func:`esp_etm_del_channel`. All requirements needed for allocating a channel are provided in :cpp:type:`esp_etm_channel_config_t`.\\n\\nBefore deleting an ETM channel, please disable it by :cpp:func:`esp_etm_channel_disable` in advance or make sure it has not been enabled yet by :cpp:func:`esp_etm_channel_enable`.\\n\\n.. _etm-event:\\n\\nETM Event\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nETM Event abstracts the event source, masking the details of specific event sources, and is represented by :cpp:type:`esp_etm_event_handle_t` in the software, allowing applications to handle different types of events more easily. ETM events can be generated from a variety of peripherals, thus the way to get the event handle differs from peripherals. When an ETM event is no longer used, you should call :cpp:func:`esp_etm_channel_connect` with a ``NULL`` event handle to disconnect it and then call :cpp:func:`esp_etm_del_event` to free the event resource.\\n\\nGPIO Events\\n~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nGPIO **edge** event is the most common event type, it can be generated by any GPIO pin. You can call :cpp:func:`gpio_new_etm_event` to create a GPIO event handle, with the configurations provided in :cpp:type:`gpio_etm_event_config_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`gpio_etm_event_config_t::edge` decides which edge to trigger the event, supported edge types are listed in the :cpp:type:`gpio_etm_event_edge_t`.\\n\\nYou need to build a connection between the GPIO ETM event handle and the GPIO number. So you should call :cpp:func:`gpio_etm_event_bind_gpio` afterwards. Please note, only the ETM event handle that created by :cpp:func:`gpio_new_etm_event` can set a GPIO number. Calling this function with other kinds of ETM events returns :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG` error. Needless to say, this function does not help with the GPIO initialization, you still need to call :cpp:func:`gpio_config` to set the property like direction, pull up/down mode separately.\\n\\nOther Peripheral Events\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    :SOC_SYSTIMER_SUPPORT_ETM: - You can call :cpp:func:`esp_systick_new_etm_alarm_event` to get the ETM event from RTOS Systick, one per CPU core.\\n    :SOC_SYSTIMER_SUPPORT_ETM: - Refer to :doc:`/api-reference/system/esp_timer` for how to get the ETM event handle from esp_timer.\\n    :SOC_TIMER_SUPPORT_ETM: - Refer to :doc:`/api-reference/peripherals/gptimer` for how to get the ETM event handle from GPTimer.\\n    :SOC_GDMA_SUPPORT_ETM: - Refer to :doc:`/api-reference/system/async_memcpy` for how to get the ETM event handle from async memcpy.\\n    :SOC_MCPWM_SUPPORT_ETM: - Refer to :doc:`/api-reference/peripherals/mcpwm` for how to get the ETM event handle from MCPWM.\\n    :SOC_ANA_CMPR_SUPPORT_ETM: - Refer to :doc:`/api-reference/peripherals/ana_cmpr` for how to get the ETM event handle from analog comparator.\\n    :SOC_TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_SUPPORT_ETM: - Refer to :doc:`/api-reference/peripherals/temp_sensor` for how to get the ETM event handle from temperature sensor.\\n\\n.. _etm-task:\\n\\nETM Task\\n^^^^^^^^\\n\\nETM Task abstracts the task action and is represented by :cpp:type:`esp_etm_task_handle_t` in the software, allowing tasks to be managed and represented in the same way. ETM tasks can be assigned to a variety of peripherals, thus the way to get the task handle differs from peripherals. When an ETM task is no longer used, you should call :cpp:func:`esp_etm_channel_connect` with a ``NULL`` task handle to disconnect it and then call :cpp:func:`esp_etm_del_task` to free the task resource.\\n\\nGPIO Tasks\\n~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nGPIO task is the most common task type, one GPIO task can even manage multiple GPIOs. When the task gets activated by the ETM channel, all managed GPIOs can set/clear/toggle at the same time. You can call :cpp:func:`gpio_new_etm_task` to create a GPIO task handle, with the configurations provided in :cpp:type:`gpio_etm_task_config_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`gpio_etm_task_config_t::action` decides what GPIO action would be taken by the ETM task. Supported actions are listed in the :cpp:type:`gpio_etm_task_action_t`.\\n\\nTo build a connection between the GPIO ETM task and the GPIO number, you should call :cpp:func:`gpio_etm_task_add_gpio`. You can call this function by several times if you want the task handle to manage more GPIOs. Please note, only the ETM task handle that created by :cpp:func:`gpio_new_etm_task` can manage a GPIO. Calling this function with other kinds of ETM tasks returns :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG` error. Needless to say, this function does not help with the GPIO initialization, you still need to call :cpp:func:`gpio_config` to set the property like direction, pull up/down mode separately.\\n\\nBefore you call :cpp:func:`esp_etm_del_task` to delete the GPIO ETM task, make sure that all previously added GPIOs are removed by :cpp:func:`gpio_etm_task_rm_gpio` in advance.\\n\\nOther Peripheral Tasks\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    :SOC_TIMER_SUPPORT_ETM: - Refer to :doc:`GPTimer </api-reference/peripherals/gptimer>` for how to get the ETM task handle from GPTimer.\\n    :SOC_TEMPERATURE_SENSOR_SUPPORT_ETM: - Refer to :doc:`/api-reference/peripherals/temp_sensor` for how to get the ETM task handle from temperature sensor.\\n\\n.. _etm-channel-control:\\n\\nETM Channel Control\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nConnect Event and Task\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nAn ETM event has no association with an ETM task, until they are connected to the same ETM channel by calling :cpp:func:`esp_etm_channel_connect`. Especially, calling the function with a ``NULL`` task/event handle means disconnecting the channel from any task or event. Note that, this function can be called either before or after the channel is enabled. But calling this function at runtime to change the connection can be dangerous, because the channel may be in the middle of a cycle, and the new connection may not take effect immediately.\\n\\nEnable and Disable Channel\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nYou can call :cpp:func:`esp_etm_channel_enable` and :cpp:func:`esp_etm_channel_disable` to enable and disable the ETM channel from working.\\n\\nETM Channel Profiling\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nTo check if the ETM channels are set with proper events and tasks, you can call :cpp:func:`esp_etm_dump` to dump all working ETM channels with their associated events and tasks. The dumping format is like:\\n\\n::\\n\\n    ===========ETM Dump Start==========\\n    channel 0: event 48 ==> task 17\\n    channel 1: event 48 ==> task 90\\n    channel 2: event 48 ==> task 94\\n    ===========ETM Dump End============\\n\\nThe digital ID printed in the dump information is defined in the ``soc/soc_etm_source.h`` file.\\n\\n.. _etm-thread-safety:\\n\\nThread Safety\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe factory functions like :cpp:func:`esp_etm_new_channel` and :cpp:func:`gpio_new_etm_task` are guaranteed to be thread-safe by the driver, which means, you can call them from different RTOS tasks without protection by extra locks.\\n\\nNo functions are allowed to run within the ISR environment.\\n\\nOther functions that take :cpp:type:`esp_etm_channel_handle_t`, :cpp:type:`esp_etm_task_handle_t` and :cpp:type:`esp_etm_event_handle_t` as the first positional parameter, are not treated as thread-safe, which means you should avoid calling them from multiple tasks.\\n\\n.. _etm-kconfig-options:\\n\\nKconfig Options\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_ETM_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG` is used to enable the debug log output.

       " \"Sigma-Delta Modulation (SDM)\\n============================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} has a second-order sigma-delta modulator, which can generate independent PDM pulses to multiple channels. Please refer to the TRM to check how many hardware channels are available. [1]_\\n\\nDelta-sigma modulation converts an analog voltage signal into a pulse frequency, or pulse density, which can be understood as pulse-density modulation (PDM) (refer to |wiki_ref|_).\\n\\nThe main differences comparing to I2S PDM mode and DAC peripheral are:\\n\\n1. SDM has no clock signal, it is just like the DAC mode of PDM;\\n2. SDM has no DMA, and it can not change its output density continuously. If you have to, you can update the density in a timer's callback;\\n3. Based on the former two points, unlike the DAC peripheral, an external active or passive low-pass filter is required additionally to restore the analog wave (See :ref:`convert_to_analog_signal`).\\n\\nTypically, a Sigma-Delta modulated channel can be used in scenarios like:\\n\\n-  LED dimming\\n-  Simple DAC (8-bit), with the help of an active RC low-pass filter\\n-  Class D amplifier, with the help of a half-bridge or full-bridge circuit plus an LC low-pass filter\\n\\nFunctional Overview\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe following sections of this document cover the typical steps to install and operate an SDM channel:\\n\\n- :ref:`sdm-resource-allocation` - covers how to initialize and configure an SDM channel and how to recycle the resources when it finishes working.\\n- :ref:`sdm-enable-and-disable-channel` - covers how to enable and disable the channel.\\n- :ref:`sdm-set-equivalent-duty-cycle` - describes how to set the equivalent duty cycle of the PDM pulses.\\n- :ref:`sdm-power-management` - describes how different source clock selections can affect power consumption.\\n- :ref:`sdm-iram-safe` - lists which functions are supposed to work even when the cache is disabled.\\n- :ref:`sdm-thread-safety` - lists which APIs are guaranteed to be thread-safe by the driver.\\n- :ref:`sdm-kconfig-options` - lists the supported Kconfig options that can be used to make a different effect on driver behavior.\\n\\n.. _sdm-resource-allocation:\\n\\nResource Allocation\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn ESP-IDF, the information and attributes of SDM channels are managed and accessed through specific data structures, where the data structure is called :cpp:type:`sdm_channel_handle_t`. Each channel is capable to output the binary, hardware-generated signal with the sigma-delta modulation. The driver manages all available channels in a pool so that there is no need to manually assign a fixed channel to a GPIO.\\n\\nTo install an SDM channel, you should call :cpp:func:`sdm_new_channel` to get a channel handle. Channel-specific configurations are passed in the :cpp:type:`sdm_config_t` structure:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`sdm_config_t::gpio_num` sets the GPIO that the PDM pulses output from.\\n- :cpp:member:`sdm_config_t::clk_src` selects the source clock for the SDM module. Note that, all channels should select the same clock source.\\n- :cpp:member:`sdm_config_t::sample_rate_hz` sets the sample rate of the SDM module.\\n- :cpp:member:`sdm_config_t::invert_out` sets whether to invert the output signal.\\n- :cpp:member:`sdm_config_t::io_loop_back` is for debugging purposes only. It enables both the GPIO's input and output ability through the GPIO matrix peripheral.\\n\\nThe function :cpp:func:`sdm_new_channel` can fail due to various errors such as insufficient memory, invalid arguments, etc. Specifically, when there are no more free channels (i.e., all hardware SDM channels have been used up), :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` will be returned.\\n\\nIf a previously created SDM channel is no longer required, you should recycle it by calling :cpp:func:`sdm_del_channel`. It allows the underlying HW channel to be used for other purposes. Before deleting an SDM channel handle, you should disable it by :cpp:func:`sdm_channel_disable` in advance or make sure it has not been enabled yet by :cpp:func:`sdm_channel_enable`.\\n\\nCreating an SDM Channel with a Sample Rate of 1 MHz\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    sdm_channel_handle_t chan = NULL;\\n    sdm_config_t config = {\\n        .clk_src = SDM_CLK_SRC_DEFAULT,\\n        .sample_rate_hz = 1 * 1000 * 1000,\\n        .gpio_num = 0,\\n    };\\n   ESP_ERROR_CHECK(sdm_new_channel(&config, &chan));\\n\\n.. _sdm-enable-and-disable-channel:\\n\\nEnable and Disable Channel\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBefore doing further IO control to the SDM channel, you should enable it first, by calling :cpp:func:`sdm_channel_enable`. Internally, this function:\\n\\n* switches the channel state from **init** to **enable**\\n* acquires a proper power management lock if a specific clock source (e.g., APB clock) is selected. See also :ref:`sdm-power-management` for more information.\\n\\nOn the contrary, calling :cpp:func:`sdm_channel_disable` does the opposite, that is, put the channel back to the **init** state and releases the power management lock.\\n\\n.. _sdm-set-equivalent-duty-cycle:\\n\\nSet Pulse Density\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFor the output PDM signals, the pulse density decides the output analog voltage that is restored by a low-pass filter. The restored analog voltage from the channel is calculated by ``Vout = VDD_IO / 256 * duty + VDD_IO / 2``. The range of the quantized ``density`` input parameter of :cpp:func:`sdm_channel_set_pulse_density` is from -128 to 127 (8-bit signed integer). Depending on the value of the ``density`` parameter, the duty cycle of the output signal will be changed accordingly. For example, if a zero value is set, then the output signal's duty will be around 50%.\\n\\n.. _sdm-power-management:\\n\\nPower Management\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen power management is enabled (i.e., :ref:`CONFIG_PM_ENABLE` is on), the system will adjust the APB frequency before going into Light-sleep, thus potentially changing the sample rate of the sigma-delta modulator.\\n\\nHowever, the driver can prevent the system from changing APB frequency by acquiring a power management lock of type :cpp:enumerator:`ESP_PM_APB_FREQ_MAX`. Whenever the driver creates an SDM channel instance that has selected :cpp:enumerator:`SDM_CLK_SRC_APB` as its clock source, the driver guarantees that the power management lock is acquired when enabling the channel by :cpp:func:`sdm_channel_enable`. Likewise, the driver releases the lock when :cpp:func:`sdm_channel_disable` is called for that channel.\\n\\n.. _sdm-iram-safe:\\n\\nIRAM Safe\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThere is a Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_SDM_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM` that can put commonly-used IO control functions into IRAM as well. So that these functions can also be executable when the cache is disabled. These IO control functions are listed as follows:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`sdm_channel_set_pulse_density`\\n\\n.. _sdm-thread-safety:\\n\\nThread Safety\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe factory function :cpp:func:`sdm_new_channel` is guaranteed to be thread-safe by the driver, which means, the user can call it from different RTOS tasks without protection by extra locks.\\n\\nThe following functions are allowed to run under ISR context, the driver uses a critical section to prevent them being called concurrently in both task and ISR.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`sdm_channel_set_pulse_density`\\n\\nOther functions that take the :cpp:type:`sdm_channel_handle_t` as the first positional parameter, are not treated as thread-safe. This means the user should avoid calling them from multiple tasks.\\n\\n.. _sdm-kconfig-options:\\n\\nKconfig Options\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_SDM_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM` controls where to place the SDM channel control functions (IRAM or Flash), see :ref:`sdm-iram-safe` for more information.\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_SDM_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG` is used to enable the debug log output. Enabling this option increases the firmware binary size.\\n\\n.. _convert_to_analog_signal:\\n\\nConvert to an Analog Signal (Optional)\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nTypically, if a Sigma-Delta signal is connected to an LED to adjust the brightness, you do not have to add any filter between them, because our eyes have their own low-pass filters for changes in light intensity. However, if you want to check the real voltage or watch the analog waveform, you need to design an analog low-pass filter. Also, it is recommended to use an active filter instead of a passive filter to gain better isolation and not lose too much voltage.\\n\\nFor example, you can take the following `Sallen-Key topology Low Pass Filter`_ as a reference.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/typical_sallenkey_LP_filter.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Sallen-Key Low Pass Filter\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Sallen-Key Low Pass Filter\\n\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\n* 100 Hz sine wave that is modulated with Sigma-Delta: :example:`peripherals/sigma_delta/sdm_dac`.\\n* LED driven by a GPIO that is modulated with Sigma-Delta: :example:`peripherals/sigma_delta/sdm_led`.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/sdm.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/sdm_types.inc\\n\\n..

When the surface is touched, the capacitance variation is used to evaluate if the touch was valid.\\n\\nThe sensing pads can be arranged in different combinations (e.g., matrix, slider), so that a larger area or more points can be detected. The touch pad sensing process is under the control of a hardware-implemented finite-state machine (FSM) which is initiated by software or a dedicated hardware timer.\\n\\nFor design, operation, and control registers of a touch sensor, see **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **On-Chip Sensors and Analog Signal Processing** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#sensor>`__].\\n\\nIn-depth design details of touch sensors and firmware development guidelines for {IDF_TARGET_NAME} are available in `Touch Sensor Application Note <https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution/blob/release/v1.0/documents/touch_pad_solution/touch_sensor_design_en.md>`_.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    For more information about testing touch sensors in various configurations, please check the `Guide for ESP32-Sense-Kit <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/espressif-esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32/esp32-sense-kit/user_guide.html>`_.\\n\\nFunctionality Overview\\n----------------------\\n\\nDescription of API is broken down into groups of functions to provide a quick overview of the following features:\\n\\n- Initialization of touch pad driver\\n- Configuration of touch pad GPIO pins\\n- Taking measurements\\n- Adjusting parameters of measurements\\n- Filtering measurements\\n- Touch detection methods\\n- Setting up interrupts to report touch detection\\n- Waking up from Sleep mode on interrupt\\n\\nFor detailed description of a particular function, please go to Section :ref:`touch_pad-api-reference`.

Additionally, the response of the touch sensor will slow down if the total time of the inverval and measurement is too long.\\n\\nOptimization of Measurements\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nA touch sensor has several configurable parameters to match the characteristics of a particular touch pad design. For instance, to sense smaller capacity changes, it is possible to narrow down the reference voltage range within which the touch pads are charged/discharged. The high and low reference voltages are set using the function :cpp:func:`touch_pad_set_voltage`.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    Besides the ability to discern smaller capacity changes, a positive side effect is reduction of power consumption for low power applications. A likely negative effect is an increase in measurement noise. If the dynamic range of obtained readings is still satisfactory, then further reduction of power consumption might be done by reducing the measurement time with :cpp:func:`touch_pad_set_measurement_clock_cycles`.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s2 or esp32s3\\n\\n    Besides the ability to discern smaller capacity changes, a positive side effect is reduction of power consumption for low power applications.

Before using the filter, please start it by calling :cpp:func:`touch_pad_filter_start`.\\n\\n    The filter type is IIR (infinite impulse response), and it has a configurable period that can be set with the function :cpp:func:`touch_pad_set_filter_period`.\\n\\n    You can stop the filter with :cpp:func:`touch_pad_filter_stop`. If not required anymore, the filter can be deleted by invoking :cpp:func:`touch_pad_filter_delete`.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s2 or esp32s3\\n\\n    If measurements are noisy, you can filter them with provided API functions. The {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s touch functionality provide two sets of APIs for doing this.\\n\\n    There is an internal touch channel that is not connected to any external GPIO. The measurements from this denoise pad can be used to filters out interference introduced on all channels, such as noise introduced by the power supply and external EMI.\\n\\n    The denoise paramaters are set with the function :cpp:func:`touch_pad_denoise_set_config` and started by with :cpp:func:`touch_pad_denoise_enable`\\n\\n    There is also a configurable hardware implemented IIR-filter (infinite impulse response). This IIR-filter is configured with the function :cpp:func:`touch_pad_filter_set_config` and enabled by calling :cpp:func:`touch_pad_filter_enable`\\n\\nTouch Detection\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTouch detection is implemented in ESP32\\'s hardware based on the user-configured threshold and raw measurements executed by FSM. Use the functions :cpp:func:`touch_pad_get_status` to check which pads have been touched and :cpp:func:`touch_pad_clear_status` to clear the touch status information.\\n\\nHardware touch detection can also be wired to interrupts. This is described in the next section.\\n\\nIf measurements are noisy and capacity changes are small, hardware touch detection might be unreliable. To resolve this issue, instead of using hardware detection/provided interrupts, implement measurement filtering and perform touch detection in your own application. For sample implementation of both methods of touch detection, see :example:`peripherals/touch_sensor/touch_sensor_{IDF_TARGET_TOUCH_SENSOR_VERSION}/touch_pad_interrupt`.\\n\\nTouch Triggered Interrupts\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBefore enabling an interrupt on a touch detection, you should establish a touch detection threshold. Use the functions described in `Touch State Measurements`_ to read and display sensor measurements when a pad is touched and released. Apply a filter if measurements are noisy and relative capacity changes are small. Depending on your application and environment conditions, test the influence of temperature and power supply voltage changes on measured values.\\n\\nOnce a detection threshold is established, it can be set during initialization with :cpp:func:`touch_pad_config` or at the runtime with :cpp:func:`touch_pad_set_thresh`.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    In the next step, configure how interrupts are triggered. They can be triggered below or above the threshold, which is set with the function :cpp:func:`touch_pad_set_trigger_mode`.\\n\\nFinally, configure and manage interrupt calls using the following functions:\\n\\n* :cpp:func:`touch_pad_isr_register` / :cpp:func:`touch_pad_isr_deregister`\\n* :cpp:func:`touch_pad_intr_enable` / :cpp:func:`touch_pad_intr_disable`\\n\\nWhen interrupts are operational, you can obtain the information from which particular pad an interrupt came by invoking :cpp:func:`touch_pad_get_status` and clear the pad status with :cpp:func:`touch_pad_clear_status`.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Interrupts on touch detection operate on raw/unfiltered measurements checked against user established threshold and are implemented in hardware. Enabling the software filtering API (see :ref:`touch_pad-api-filtering-of-measurements`) does not affect this process.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    Wakeup from Sleep Mode\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    If touch pad interrupts are used to wake up the chip from a sleep mode, you can select a certain configuration of pads (SET1 or both SET1 and SET2) that should be touched to trigger the interrupt and cause the subsequent wakeup. To do so, use the function :cpp:func:`touch_pad_set_trigger_source`.\\n\\n    Configuration of required bit patterns of pads may be managed for each \\'SET\\' with:\\n\\n    * :cpp:func:`touch_pad_set_group_mask` / :cpp:func:`touch_pad_get_group_mask`\\n    * :cpp:func:`touch_pad_clear_group_mask`\\n\\n.. _touch_pad-api-examples:\\n\\nApplication Examples\\n--------------------\\n\\n- Touch sensor read example: :example:`peripherals/touch_sensor/touch_sensor_{IDF_TARGET_TOUCH_SENSOR_VERSION}/touch_pad_read`.\\n- Touch sensor interrupt example: :example:`peripherals/touch_sensor/touch_sensor_{IDF_TARGET_TOUCH_SENSOR_VERSION}/touch_pad_interrupt`.\\n\\n.. _touch_pad-api-reference:\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/touch_sensor.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/touch_sensor_common.inc\\n\\nGPIO Lookup Macros\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSome useful macros can be used to specified the GPIO number of a touch pad channel, or vice versa. e.g.,\\n\\n1. ``TOUCH_PAD_NUM5_GPIO_NUM`` is the GPIO number of channel 5 (12);\\n2. ``TOUCH_PAD_GPIO4_CHANNEL`` is the channel number of GPIO 4 (channel 0).\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/touch_sensor_channel.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/touch_sensor_types.inc\\n',\n",
       " 'SPI Slave Driver\\n================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nSPI Slave driver is a program that controls {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s General Purpose SPI (GP-SPI) peripheral(s) when it functions as a slave.\\n\\nFor more hardware information about the GP-SPI peripheral(s), see **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **SPI Controller** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#spi>`__].\\n\\nTerminology\\n-----------\\n\\nThe terms used in relation to the SPI slave driver are given in the table below.\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n   :widths: 30 70\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n\\n   * - Term\\n     - Definition\\n   * - Host\\n     - The SPI controller peripheral external to {IDF_TARGET_NAME} that initiates SPI transmissions over the bus, and acts as an SPI Master.\\n   * - Device\\n     - SPI slave device (general purpose SPI controller). Each Device shares the MOSI, MISO and SCLK signals but is only active on the bus when the Host asserts the Device\\'s individual CS line.\\n   * - Bus\\n     - A signal bus, common to all Devices connected to one Host. In general, a bus includes the following lines: MISO, MOSI, SCLK, one or more CS lines, and, optionally, QUADWP and QUADHD. So Devices are connected to the same lines, with the exception that each Device has its own CS line. Several Devices can also share one CS line if connected in the daisy-chain manner.\\n   * - MISO\\n     - Master In, Slave Out, a.k.a. Q. Data transmission from a Device to Host.\\n   * - MOSI\\n     - Master Out, Slave In, a.k.a. D. Data transmission from a Host to Device.\\n   * - SCLK\\n     - Serial Clock. Oscillating signal generated by a Host that keeps the transmission of data bits in sync.\\n   * - CS\\n     - Chip Select. Allows a Host to select individual Device(s) connected to the bus in order to send or receive data.\\n   * - QUADWP\\n     - Write Protect signal. Only used for 4-bit (qio/qout) transactions.\\n   * - QUADHD\\n     - Hold signal. Only used for 4-bit (qio/qout) transactions.\\n   * - Assertion\\n     - The action of activating a line. The opposite action of returning the line back to inactive (back to idle) is called **de-assertion**.\\n   * - Transaction\\n     - One instance of a Host asserting a CS line, transferring data to and from a Device, and de-asserting the CS line. Transactions are atomic, which means they can never be interrupted by another transaction.\\n   * - Launch Edge\\n     - Edge of the clock at which the source register **launches** the signal onto the line.\\n   * - Latch Edge\\n     - Edge of the clock at which the destination register **latches in** the signal.\\n\\n\\nDriver Features\\n---------------\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_MAX_DATA_BUF:default=\"64\", esp32s2=\"72\"}\\n\\nThe SPI slave driver allows using the SPI peripherals as full-duplex Devices. The driver can send/receive transactions up to {IDF_TARGET_MAX_DATA_BUF} bytes in length, or utilize DMA to send/receive longer transactions. However, there are some :ref:`known issues <spi_dma_known_issues>` related to DMA.\\n\\nThe SPI slave driver supports registering the SPI ISR to a certain CPU core. If multiple tasks try to access the same SPI Device simultaneously, it is recommended that your application be refactored so that each SPI peripheral is only accessed by a single task at a time. Please also use :cpp:member:`spi_bus_config_t::isr_cpu_id` to register the SPI ISR to the same core as SPI peripheral related tasks to ensure thread safety.\\n\\nSPI Transactions\\n----------------\\n\\nA full-duplex SPI transaction begins when the Host asserts the CS line and starts sending out clock pulses on the SCLK line. Every clock pulse, a data bit is shifted from the Host to the Device on the MOSI line and back on the MISO line at the same time. At the end of the transaction, the Host de-asserts the CS line.\\n\\nThe attributes of a transaction are determined by the configuration structure for an SPI peripheral acting as a slave device :cpp:type:`spi_slave_interface_config_t`, and transaction configuration structure :cpp:type:`spi_slave_transaction_t`.\\n\\nAs not every transaction requires both writing and reading data, you can choose to configure the :cpp:type:`spi_transaction_t` structure for TX only, RX only, or TX and RX transactions. If :cpp:member:`spi_slave_transaction_t::rx_buffer` is set to ``NULL``, the read phase will be skipped. Similarly, if :cpp:member:`spi_slave_transaction_t::tx_buffer` is set to ``NULL``, the write phase will be skipped.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    A Host should not start a transaction before its Device is ready for receiving data. It is recommended to use another GPIO pin for a handshake signal to sync the Devices. For more details, see :ref:`transaction_interval`.\\n\\n\\nDriver Usage\\n------------\\n\\n- Initialize an SPI peripheral as a Device by calling the function :cpp:func:`spi_slave_initialize`. Make sure to set the correct I/O pins in the struct `bus_config`. Set the unused signals to ``-1``.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    If transactions are expected to be longer than 32 bytes, set the parameter ``dma_chan`` to ``1`` or ``2`` to allow a DMA channel 1 or 2 respectively. Otherwise, set ``dma_chan`` to ``0``.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s2\\n\\n    If transactions will be longer than 32 bytes, allow a DMA channel by setting the parameter ``dma_chan`` to the host device. Otherwise, set ``dma_chan`` to ``0``.\\n\\n- Before initiating transactions, fill one or more :cpp:type:`spi_slave_transaction_t` structs with the transaction parameters required. Either queue all transactions by calling the function :cpp:func:`spi_slave_queue_trans` and, at a later time, query the result by using the function :cpp:func:`spi_slave_get_trans_result`, or handle all requests individually by feeding them into :cpp:func:`spi_slave_transmit`. The latter two functions will be blocked until the Host has initiated and finished a transaction, causing the queued data to be sent and received.\\n\\n- (Optional) To unload the SPI slave driver, call :cpp:func:`spi_slave_free`.\\n\\n\\nTransaction Data and Master/Slave Length Mismatches\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNormally, the data that needs to be transferred to or from a Device is read or written to a chunk of memory indicated by the :cpp:member:`spi_slave_transaction_t::rx_buffer` and :cpp:member:`spi_slave_transaction_t::tx_buffer`. The SPI driver can be configured to use DMA for transfers, in which case these buffers must be allocated in DMA-capable memory using ``pvPortMallocCaps(size, MALLOC_CAP_DMA)``.\\n\\nThe amount of data that the driver can read or write to the buffers is limited by :cpp:member:`spi_slave_transaction_t::length`. However, this member does not define the actual length of an SPI transaction. A transaction\\'s length is determined by the clock and CS lines driven by the Host. The actual length of the transmission can be read only after a transaction is finished from the member :cpp:member:`spi_slave_transaction_t::trans_len`.\\n\\nIf the length of the transmission is greater than the buffer length, only the initial number of bits specified in the :cpp:member:`spi_slave_transaction_t::length` member will be sent and received. In this case, :cpp:member:`spi_slave_transaction_t::trans_len` is set to :cpp:member:`spi_slave_transaction_t::length` instead of the actual transaction length. To meet the actual transaction length requirements, set :cpp:member:`spi_slave_transaction_t::length` to a value greater than the maximum :cpp:member:`spi_slave_transaction_t::trans_len` expected. If the transmission length is shorter than the buffer length, only the data equal to the length of the buffer will be transmitted.\\n\\nGPIO Matrix and IO_MUX\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    Most of {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s peripheral signals have direct connection to their dedicated IO_MUX pins. However, the signals can also be routed to any other available pins using the less direct GPIO matrix.\\n\\n    If at least one signal is routed through the GPIO matrix, then all signals will be routed through it. If the driver is configured so that all SPI signals are either routed to their dedicated IO_MUX pins or are not connected at all, the GPIO matrix will be bypassed.\\n\\n    The GPIO matrix introduces flexibility of routing but also increases the input delay of the MISO signal, which makes MISO setup time violations more likely. If SPI needs to operate at high speeds, use dedicated IO_MUX pins.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        For more details about the influence of the MISO input delay on the maximum clock frequency, see :ref:`timing_considerations`.\\n\\n    The IO_MUX pins for SPI buses are given below.\\n\\n    .. list-table::\\n       :widths: 40 30 30\\n       :header-rows: 1\\n\\n       * - Pin Name\\n         - GPIO Number (SPI2)\\n         - GPIO Number (SPI3)\\n       * - CS0\\n         - 15\\n         - 5\\n       * - SCLK\\n         - 14\\n         - 18\\n       * - MISO\\n         - 12\\n         - 19\\n       * - MOSI\\n         - 13\\n         - 23\\n       * - QUADWP\\n         - 2\\n         - 22\\n       * - QUADHD\\n         - 4\\n         - 21\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_SPI2_IOMUX_PIN_CS:default=\"N/A\",   esp32s2=\"10\", esp32s3=\"10\", esp32c2=\"10\", esp32c3=\"10\", esp32c6=\"16\", esp32h2=\"1\", esp32p4=\"7\"}\\n    {IDF_TARGET_SPI2_IOMUX_PIN_CLK:default=\"N/A\",  esp32s2=\"12\", esp32s3=\"12\", esp32c2=\"6\",  esp32c3=\"6\",  esp32c6=\"6\",  esp32h2=\"4\", esp32p4=\"9\"}\\n    {IDF_TARGET_SPI2_IOMUX_PIN_MOSI:default=\"N/A\", esp32s2=\"11\"  esp32s3=\"11\", esp32c2=\"7\"   esp32c3=\"7\",  esp32c6=\"7\",  esp32h2=\"5\", esp32p4=\"8\"}\\n    {IDF_TARGET_SPI2_IOMUX_PIN_MISO:default=\"N/A\", esp32s2=\"13\"  esp32s3=\"13\", esp32c2=\"2\"   esp32c3=\"2\",  esp32c6=\"2\",  esp32h2=\"0\", esp32p4=\"10\"}\\n    {IDF_TARGET_SPI2_IOMUX_PIN_HD:default=\"N/A\",   esp32s2=\"9\"   esp32s3=\"9\",  esp32c2=\"4\"   esp32c3=\"4\",  esp32c6=\"4\",  esp32h2=\"3\", esp32p4=\"6\"}\\n    {IDF_TARGET_SPI2_IOMUX_PIN_WP:default=\"N/A\",   esp32s2=\"14\"  esp32s3=\"14\", esp32c2=\"5\"   esp32c3=\"5\",  esp32c6=\"5\",  esp32h2=\"2\", esp32p4=\"11\"}\\n\\n    Most of chip\\'s peripheral signals have direct connection to their dedicated IO_MUX pins.

All transactions must be handled by the CPU, which means that the transfers and responses are not real-time, and there might be noticeable latency.\\n\\nAs a solution, a Device\\'s response rate can be doubled by using the functions :cpp:func:`spi_slave_queue_trans` and then :cpp:func:`spi_slave_get_trans_result` instead of using :cpp:func:`spi_slave_transmit`.\\n\\nYou can also configure a GPIO pin through which the Device will signal to the Host when it is ready for a new transaction. A code example of this can be found in :example:`peripherals/spi_slave`.\\n\\n\\nSCLK Frequency Requirements\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_MAX_FREQ:default=\"60\", esp32=\"10\", esp32s2=\"40\", esp32c6=\"40\", esp32h2=\"32\"}\\n\\nThe SPI slaves are designed to operate at up to {IDF_TARGET_MAX_FREQ} MHz.

Although it is usually the case for most masters.\\n\\n    - Write (MISO):\\n        The output delay of the MISO signal needs to be shorter than half of a clock cycle period so that the MISO line is stable before the next latch edge.

The output delay is measured under ideal circumstances (no load). If the MISO pin is heavily loaded, the output delay will be longer, and the maximum allowed frequency will be lower.\\n\\n        Exception: The frequency is allowed to be higher if the master has more tolerance for the MISO setup time, e.g., latch data at the next edge, or configurable latching time.\\n\\n\\n.. _spi_dma_known_issues:\\n\\nRestrictions and Known Issues\\n-----------------------------\\n\\n1. If DMA is enabled, the rx buffer should be word-aligned (starting from a 32-bit boundary and having a length of multiples of 4 bytes).

For SPI modes 0 and 2, the MISO signal has to be launched half a clock cycle earlier to meet the timing. The new timing is as follows:\\n\\n    .. wavedrom:: /../_static/diagrams/spi/spi_slave_miso_dma.json\\n\\n    If DMA is enabled, a Device\\'s launch edge is half of an SPI clock cycle ahead of the normal time, shifting to the Master\\'s actual latch edge. In this case, if the GPIO matrix is bypassed, the hold time for data sampling is 68.75 ns and no longer a half of an SPI clock cycle. If the GPIO matrix is used, the hold time will increase to 93.75 ns. The Host should sample the data immediately at the latch edge or communicate in SPI modes 1 or 3. If your Host cannot meet these timing requirements, initialize your Device without DMA.\\n\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe code example for Device/Host communication can be found in the :example:`peripherals/spi_slave` directory of ESP-IDF examples.\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/spi_slave.inc\\n',\n",
       " 'Remote Control Transceiver (RMT)\\n================================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nThe RMT (Remote Control Transceiver) peripheral was designed to act as an infrared transceiver. However, due to the flexibility of its data format, RMT can be extended to a versatile and general-purpose transceiver, transmitting or receiving many other types of signals. From the perspective of network layering, the RMT hardware contains both physical and data link layers. The physical layer defines the communication media and bit signal representation. The data link layer defines the format of an RMT frame. The minimal data unit in the frame is called the **RMT symbol**, which is represented by :cpp:type:`rmt_symbol_word_t` in the driver.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} contains multiple channels in the RMT peripheral [1]_. Each channel can be independently configured as either transmitter or receiver.\\n\\nTypically, the RMT peripheral can be used in the following scenarios:\\n\\n- Transmit or receive infrared signals, with any IR protocols, e.g., NEC\\n- General-purpose sequence generator\\n- Transmit signals in a hardware-controlled loop, with a finite or infinite number of times\\n- Multi-channel simultaneous transmission\\n- Modulate the carrier to the output signal or demodulate the carrier from the input signal\\n\\nLayout of RMT Symbols\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe RMT hardware defines data in its own pattern -- the **RMT symbol**. The diagram below illustrates the bit fields of an RMT symbol. Each symbol consists of two pairs of two values. The first value in the pair is a 15-bit value representing the signal\\'s duration in units of RMT ticks. The second in the pair is a 1-bit value representing the signal\\'s logic level, i.e., high or low.\\n\\n.. packetdiag:: /../_static/diagrams/rmt/rmt_symbols.diag\\n    :caption: Structure of RMT symbols (L - signal level)\\n    :align: center\\n\\nRMT Transmitter Overview\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe data path and control path of an RMT TX channel is illustrated in the figure below:\\n\\n.. blockdiag:: /../_static/diagrams/rmt/rmt_tx.diag\\n    :caption: RMT Transmitter Overview\\n    :align: center\\n\\nThe driver encodes the user\\'s data into RMT data format, then the RMT transmitter can generate the waveforms according to the encoding artifacts. It is also possible to modulate a high-frequency carrier signal before being routed to a GPIO pad.\\n\\nRMT Receiver Overview\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe data path and control path of an RMT RX channel is illustrated in the figure below:\\n\\n.. blockdiag:: /../_static/diagrams/rmt/rmt_rx.diag\\n    :caption: RMT Receiver Overview\\n    :align: center\\n\\nThe RMT receiver can sample incoming signals into RMT data format, and store the data in memory. It is also possible to tell the receiver the basic characteristics of the incoming signal, so that the signal\\'s stop condition can be recognized, and signal glitches and noise can be filtered out. The RMT peripheral also supports demodulating the high-frequency carrier from the base signal.\\n\\nFunctional Overview\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe description of the RMT functionality is divided into the following sections:\\n\\n- :ref:`rmt-resource-allocation` - covers how to allocate and properly configure RMT channels. It also covers how to recycle channels and other resources when they are no longer used.\\n- :ref:`rmt-carrier-modulation-and demodulation` - describes how to modulate and demodulate the carrier signals for TX and RX channels respectively.\\n- :ref:`rmt-register-event-callbacks` - covers how to register user-provided event callbacks to receive RMT channel events.\\n- :ref:`rmt-enable-and-disable-channel` - shows how to enable and disable the RMT channel.\\n- :ref:`rmt-initiate-tx-transaction` - describes the steps to initiate a transaction for a TX channel.\\n- :ref:`rmt-initiate-rx-transaction` - describes the steps to initiate a transaction for an RX channel.\\n- :ref:`rmt-multiple-channels-simultaneous-transmission` - describes how to collect multiple channels into a sync group so that their transmissions can be started simultaneously.\\n- :ref:`rmt-rmt-encoder` - focuses on how to write a customized encoder by combining multiple primitive encoders that are provided by the driver.\\n- :ref:`rmt-power-management` - describes how different clock sources affects power consumption.\\n- :ref:`rmt-iram-safe` - describes how disabling the cache affects the RMT driver, and tips to mitigate it.\\n- :ref:`rmt-thread-safety` - lists which APIs are guaranteed to be thread-safe by the driver.\\n- :ref:`rmt-kconfig-options` - describes the various Kconfig options supported by the RMT driver.\\n\\n.. _rmt-resource-allocation:\\n\\nResource Allocation\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBoth RMT TX and RX channels are represented by :cpp:type:`rmt_channel_handle_t` in the driver. The driver internally manages which channels are available and hands out a free channel on request.\\n\\nInstall RMT TX Channel\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nTo install an RMT TX channel, there is a configuration structure that needs to be given in advance :cpp:type:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t`. The following list describes each member of the configuration structure.\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::gpio_num` sets the GPIO number used by the transmitter.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::clk_src` selects the source clock for the RMT channel. The available clocks are listed in :cpp:type:`rmt_clock_source_t`. Note that, the selected clock is also used by other channels, which means the user should ensure this configuration is the same when allocating other channels, regardless of TX or RX. For the effect on the power consumption of different clock sources, please refer to the :ref:`rmt-power-management` section.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::resolution_hz` sets the resolution of the internal tick counter. The timing parameter of the RMT signal is calculated based on this **tick**.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::mem_block_symbols` has a slightly different meaning based on if the DMA backend is enabled or not.\\n\\n    - If the DMA is enabled via :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::with_dma`, then this field controls the size of the internal DMA buffer. To achieve a better throughput and smaller CPU overhead, you can set a larger value, e.g., ``1024``.\\n    - If DMA is not used, this field controls the size of the dedicated memory block owned by the channel, which should be at least {IDF_TARGET_SOC_RMT_MEM_WORDS_PER_CHANNEL}.\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::trans_queue_depth` sets the depth of the internal transaction queue, the deeper the queue, the more transactions can be prepared in the backlog.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::invert_out` is used to decide whether to invert the RMT signal before sending it to the GPIO pad.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::with_dma` enables the DMA backend for the channel. Using the DMA allows a significant amount of the channel\\'s workload to be offloaded from the CPU. However, the DMA backend is not available on all ESP chips, please refer to [`TRM <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#rmt>`__] before you enable this option. Or you might encounter a :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED` error.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::io_loop_back` enables both input and output capabilities on the channel\\'s assigned GPIO. Thus, by binding a TX and RX channel to the same GPIO, loopback can be achieved.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::io_od_mode` configures the channel\\'s assigned GPIO as open-drain. When combined with :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::io_loop_back`, a bi-directional bus (e.g., 1-wire) can be achieved.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::intr_priority` Set the priority of the interrupt. If set to ``0`` , then the driver will use a interrupt with low or medium priority (priority level may be one of 1,2 or 3), otherwise use the priority indicated by :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::intr_priority`. Please use the number form (1,2,3) , not the bitmask form ((1<<1),(1<<2),(1<<3)). Please pay attention that once the interrupt priority is set, it cannot be changed until :cpp:func:`rmt_del_channel` is called.\\n\\nOnce the :cpp:type:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t` structure is populated with mandatory parameters, users can call :cpp:func:`rmt_new_tx_channel` to allocate and initialize a TX channel. This function returns an RMT channel handle if it runs correctly. Specifically, when there are no more free channels in the RMT resource pool, this function returns :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error.

If the TX Channel was set up first, then during the RX Channel setup, the previous RMT TX Channel signal will be overridden by the GPIO control signal.\\n\\nUninstall RMT Channel\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIf a previously installed RMT channel is no longer needed, it is recommended to recycle the resources by calling :cpp:func:`rmt_del_channel`, which in return allows the underlying software and hardware resources to be reused for other purposes.\\n\\n.. _rmt-carrier-modulation-and demodulation:\\n\\nCarrier Modulation and Demodulation\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe RMT transmitter can generate a carrier wave and modulate it onto the message signal. Compared to the message signal, the carrier signal\\'s frequency is significantly higher. In addition, the user can only set the frequency and duty cycle for the carrier signal. The RMT receiver can demodulate the carrier signal from the incoming signal. Note that, carrier modulation and demodulation are not supported on all ESP chips, please refer to [`TRM <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#rmt>`__] before configuring the carrier, or you might encounter a :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED` error.\\n\\nCarrier-related configurations lie in :cpp:type:`rmt_carrier_config_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_carrier_config_t::frequency_hz` sets the carrier frequency, in Hz.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_carrier_config_t::duty_cycle` sets the carrier duty cycle.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_carrier_config_t::polarity_active_low` sets the carrier polarity, i.e., on which level the carrier is applied.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_carrier_config_t::always_on` sets whether to output the carrier even when the data transmission has finished. This configuration is only valid for the TX channel.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    For the RX channel, we should not set the carrier frequency exactly to the theoretical value. It is recommended to leave a tolerance for the carrier frequency. For example, in the snippet below, we set the frequency to 25 KHz, instead of the 38 KHz configured on the TX side. The reason is that reflection and refraction occur when a signal travels through the air, leading to distortion on the receiver side.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    rmt_carrier_config_t tx_carrier_cfg = {\\n        .duty_cycle = 0.33,                 // duty cycle 33%\\n        .frequency_hz = 38000,              // 38 KHz\\n        .flags.polarity_active_low = false, // carrier should be modulated to high level\\n    };\\n    // modulate carrier to TX channel\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(rmt_apply_carrier(tx_chan, &tx_carrier_cfg));\\n\\n    rmt_carrier_config_t rx_carrier_cfg = {\\n        .duty_cycle = 0.33,                 // duty cycle 33%\\n        .frequency_hz = 25000,              // 25 KHz carrier, should be smaller than the transmitter\\'s carrier frequency\\n        .flags.polarity_active_low = false, // the carrier is modulated to high level\\n    };\\n    // demodulate carrier from RX channel\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(rmt_apply_carrier(rx_chan, &rx_carrier_cfg));\\n\\n.. _rmt-register-event-callbacks:\\n\\nRegister Event Callbacks\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen an event occurs on an RMT channel (e.g., transmission or receiving is completed), the CPU is notified of this event via an interrupt. If you have some function that needs to be called when a particular events occur, you can register a callback for that event to the RMT driver\\'s ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) by calling :cpp:func:`rmt_tx_register_event_callbacks` and :cpp:func:`rmt_rx_register_event_callbacks` for TX and RX channel respectively. Since the registered callback functions are called in the interrupt context, the user should ensure the callback function does not block, e.g., by making sure that only FreeRTOS APIs with the ``FromISR`` suffix are called from within the function. The callback function has a boolean return value used to indicate whether a higher priority task has been unblocked by the callback.\\n\\nThe TX channel-supported event callbacks are listed in the :cpp:type:`rmt_tx_event_callbacks_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_event_callbacks_t::on_trans_done` sets a callback function for the \"trans-done\" event. The function prototype is declared in :cpp:type:`rmt_tx_done_callback_t`.\\n\\nThe RX channel-supported event callbacks are listed in the :cpp:type:`rmt_rx_event_callbacks_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_rx_event_callbacks_t::on_recv_done` sets a callback function for \"receive-done\" event. The function prototype is declared in :cpp:type:`rmt_rx_done_callback_t`.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The \"receive-done\" is not equivalent to \"receive-finished\". This callback can also be called at a \"partial-receive-done\" time, for many times during one receive transaction.\\n\\nUsers can save their own context in :cpp:func:`rmt_tx_register_event_callbacks` and :cpp:func:`rmt_rx_register_event_callbacks` as well, via the parameter ``user_data``. The user data is directly passed to each callback function.\\n\\nIn the callback function, users can fetch the event-specific data that is filled by the driver in the ``edata``. Note that the ``edata`` pointer is **only** valid during the callback, please do not try to save this pointer and use that outside of the callback function.\\n\\nThe TX-done event data is defined in :cpp:type:`rmt_tx_done_event_data_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_done_event_data_t::num_symbols` indicates the number of transmitted RMT symbols. This also reflects the size of the encoding artifacts. Please note, this value accounts for the ``EOF`` symbol as well, which is appended by the driver to mark the end of one transaction.\\n\\nThe RX-complete event data is defined in :cpp:type:`rmt_rx_done_event_data_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_rx_done_event_data_t::received_symbols` points to the received RMT symbols. These symbols are saved in the ``buffer`` parameter of the :cpp:func:`rmt_receive` function. Users should not free this receive buffer before the callback returns. If you also enabled the partial receive feature, then the user buffer will be used as a \"second level buffer\", where its content can be overwritten by data comes in afterwards. In this case, you should copy the received data to another place if you want to keep it or process it later.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_rx_done_event_data_t::num_symbols` indicates the number of received RMT symbols. This value is not larger than the ``buffer_size`` parameter of :cpp:func:`rmt_receive` function. If the ``buffer_size`` is not sufficient to accommodate all the received RMT symbols, the driver only keeps the maximum number of symbols that the buffer can hold, and excess symbols are discarded or ignored.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_rx_done_event_data_t::is_last` indicates whether the current received buffer is the last one in the transaction. This is useful when you enable the partial reception feature by :cpp:member:`rmt_receive_config_t::extra_flags::en_partial_rx`.\\n\\n.. _rmt-enable-and-disable-channel:\\n\\nEnable and Disable Channel\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n:cpp:func:`rmt_enable` must be called in advance before transmitting or receiving RMT symbols. For TX channels, enabling a channel enables a specific interrupt and prepares the hardware to dispatch transactions. For RX channels, enabling a channel enables an interrupt, but the receiver is not started during this time, as the characteristics of the incoming signal have yet to be specified. The receiver is started in :cpp:func:`rmt_receive`.\\n\\n:cpp:func:`rmt_disable` does the opposite by disabling the interrupt and clearing any pending interrupts. The transmitter and receiver are disabled as well.\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(rmt_enable(tx_chan));\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(rmt_enable(rx_chan));\\n\\n.. _rmt-initiate-tx-transaction:\\n\\nInitiate TX Transaction\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nRMT is a special communication peripheral, as it is unable to transmit raw byte streams like SPI and I2C. RMT can only send data in its own format :cpp:type:`rmt_symbol_word_t`. However, the hardware does not help to convert the user data into RMT symbols, this can only be done in software by the so-called **RMT Encoder**. The encoder is responsible for encoding user data into RMT symbols and then writing to the RMT memory block or the DMA buffer. For how to create an RMT encoder, please refer to :ref:`rmt-rmt-encoder`.\\n\\nOnce you created an encoder, you can initiate a TX transaction by calling :cpp:func:`rmt_transmit`. This function takes several positional parameters like channel handle, encoder handle, and payload buffer. Besides, you also need to provide a transmission-specific configuration in :cpp:type:`rmt_transmit_config_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_transmit_config_t::loop_count` sets the number of transmission loops. After the transmitter has finished one round of transmission, it can restart the same transmission again if this value is not set to zero. As the loop is controlled by hardware, the RMT channel can be used to generate many periodic sequences with minimal CPU intervention.\\n\\n    - Setting :cpp:member:`rmt_transmit_config_t::loop_count` to `-1` means an infinite loop transmission. In this case, the channel does not stop until :cpp:func:`rmt_disable` is called. The \"trans-done\" event is not generated as well.\\n    - Setting :cpp:member:`rmt_transmit_config_t::loop_count` to a positive number means finite number of iterations. In this case, the \"trans-done\" event is when the specified number of iterations have completed.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        The **loop transmit** feature is not supported on all ESP chips, please refer to [`TRM <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#rmt>`__] before you configure this option, or you might encounter :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED` error.\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_transmit_config_t::eot_level` sets the output level when the transmitter finishes working or stops working by calling :cpp:func:`rmt_disable`.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_transmit_config_t::queue_nonblocking` sets whether to wait for a free slot in the transaction queue when it is full. If this value is set to ``true``, then the function will return with an error code :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` when the queue is full. Otherwise, the function will block until a free slot is available in the queue.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    There is a limitation in the transmission size if the :cpp:member:`rmt_transmit_config_t::loop_count` is set to non-zero, i.e., to enable the loop feature. The encoded RMT symbols should not exceed the capacity of the RMT hardware memory block size, or you might see an error message like ``encoding artifacts can\\'t exceed hw memory block for loop transmission``. If you have to start a large transaction by loop, you can try either of the following methods.\\n\\n    - Increase the :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::mem_block_symbols`. This approach does not work if the DMA backend is also enabled.\\n    - Customize an encoder and construct an infinite loop in the encoding function. See also :ref:`rmt-rmt-encoder`.\\n\\nInternally, :cpp:func:`rmt_transmit` constructs a transaction descriptor and sends it to a job queue, which is dispatched in the ISR. So it is possible that the transaction is not started yet when :cpp:func:`rmt_transmit` returns. To ensure all pending transactions to complete, the user can use :cpp:func:`rmt_tx_wait_all_done`.\\n\\n.. _rmt-multiple-channels-simultaneous-transmission:\\n\\nMultiple Channels Simultaneous Transmission\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn some real-time control applications (e.g., to make two robotic arms move simultaneously), you do not want any time drift between different channels. The RMT driver can help to manage this by creating a so-called **Sync Manager**. The sync manager is represented by :cpp:type:`rmt_sync_manager_handle_t` in the driver. The procedure of RMT sync transmission is shown as follows:\\n\\n.. figure:: /../_static/rmt_tx_sync.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: RMT TX Sync\\n\\n    RMT TX Sync\\n\\nInstall RMT Sync Manager\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nTo create a sync manager, the user needs to tell which channels are going to be managed in the :cpp:type:`rmt_sync_manager_config_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_sync_manager_config_t::tx_channel_array` points to the array of TX channels to be managed.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_sync_manager_config_t::array_size` sets the number of channels to be managed.\\n\\n:cpp:func:`rmt_new_sync_manager` can return a manager handle on success. This function could also fail due to various errors such as invalid arguments, etc. Especially, when the sync manager has been installed before, and there are no hardware resources to create another manager, this function reports :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error. In addition, if the sync manager is not supported by the hardware, it reports a :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED` error. Please refer to [`TRM <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#rmt>`__] before using the sync manager feature.\\n\\nStart Transmission Simultaneously\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nFor any managed TX channel, it does not start the machine until :cpp:func:`rmt_transmit` has been called on all channels in :cpp:member:`rmt_sync_manager_config_t::tx_channel_array`. Before that, the channel is just put in a waiting state. TX channels will usually complete their transactions at different times due to differing transactions, thus resulting in a loss of sync. So before restarting a simultaneous transmission, the user needs to call :cpp:func:`rmt_sync_reset` to synchronize all channels again.\\n\\nCalling :cpp:func:`rmt_del_sync_manager` can recycle the sync manager and enable the channels to initiate transactions independently afterward.\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    rmt_channel_handle_t tx_channels[2] = {NULL}; // declare two channels\\n    int tx_gpio_number[2] = {0, 2};\\n    // install channels one by one\\n    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {\\n        rmt_tx_channel_config_t tx_chan_config = {\\n            .clk_src = RMT_CLK_SRC_DEFAULT,       // select source clock\\n            .gpio_num = tx_gpio_number[i],    // GPIO number\\n            .mem_block_symbols = 64,          // memory block size, 64 * 4 = 256 Bytes\\n            .resolution_hz = 1 * 1000 * 1000, // 1 MHz resolution\\n            .trans_queue_depth = 1,           // set the number of transactions that can pend in the background\\n        };\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK(rmt_new_tx_channel(&tx_chan_config, &tx_channels[i]));\\n    }\\n    // install sync manager\\n    rmt_sync_manager_handle_t synchro = NULL;\\n    rmt_sync_manager_config_t synchro_config = {\\n        .tx_channel_array = tx_channels,\\n        .array_size = sizeof(tx_channels) / sizeof(tx_channels[0]),\\n    };\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(rmt_new_sync_manager(&synchro_config, &synchro));\\n\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(rmt_transmit(tx_channels[0], led_strip_encoders[0], led_data, led_num * 3, &transmit_config));\\n    // tx_channels[0] does not start transmission until call of `rmt_transmit()` for tx_channels[1] returns\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(rmt_transmit(tx_channels[1], led_strip_encoders[1], led_data, led_num * 3, &transmit_config));\\n\\n.. _rmt-initiate-rx-transaction:\\n\\nInitiate RX Transaction\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAs also discussed in the :ref:`rmt-enable-and-disable-channel`, calling :cpp:func:`rmt_enable` does not prepare an RX to receive RMT symbols. The user needs to specify the basic characteristics of the incoming signals in :cpp:type:`rmt_receive_config_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_receive_config_t::signal_range_min_ns` specifies the minimal valid pulse duration in either high or low logic levels. A pulse width that is smaller than this value is treated as a glitch, and ignored by the hardware.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_receive_config_t::signal_range_max_ns` specifies the maximum valid pulse duration in either high or low logic levels. A pulse width that is bigger than this value is treated as **Stop Signal**, and the receiver generates receive-complete event immediately.\\n- If the incoming packet is long, that they cannot be stored in the user buffer at once, you can enable the partial reception feature by setting :cpp:member:`rmt_receive_config_t::extra_flags::en_partial_rx` to ``true``. In this case, the driver invokes :cpp:member:`rmt_rx_event_callbacks_t::on_recv_done` callback multiple times during one transaction, when the user buffer is **almost full**. You can check the value of :cpp:member::`rmt_rx_done_event_data_t::is_last` to know if the transaction is about to finish.\\n\\nThe RMT receiver starts the RX machine after the user calls :cpp:func:`rmt_receive` with the provided configuration above. Note that, this configuration is transaction specific, which means, to start a new round of reception, the user needs to set the :cpp:type:`rmt_receive_config_t` again. The receiver saves the incoming signals into its internal memory block or DMA buffer, in the format of :cpp:type:`rmt_symbol_word_t`.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_RMT_SUPPORT_RX_PINGPONG\\n\\n    Due to the limited size of the memory block, the RMT receiver notifies the driver to copy away the accumulated symbols in a ping-pong way.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_RMT_SUPPORT_RX_PINGPONG\\n\\n    Due to the limited size of the memory block, the RMT receiver can only save short frames whose length is not longer than the memory block capacity. Long frames are truncated by the hardware, and the driver reports an error message: ``hw buffer too small, received symbols truncated``.\\n\\nThe copy destination should be provided in the ``buffer`` parameter of :cpp:func:`rmt_receive` function. If this buffer overflows due to an insufficient buffer size, the receiver can continue to work, but overflowed symbols are dropped and the following error message is reported: ``user buffer too small, received symbols truncated``. Please take care of the lifecycle of the ``buffer`` parameter, ensuring that the buffer is not recycled before the receiver is finished or stopped.\\n\\nThe receiver is stopped by the driver when it finishes working, i.e., receive a signal whose duration is bigger than :cpp:member:`rmt_receive_config_t::signal_range_max_ns`. The user needs to call :cpp:func:`rmt_receive` again to restart the receiver, if necessary. The user can get the received data in the :cpp:member:`rmt_rx_event_callbacks_t::on_recv_done` callback. See also :ref:`rmt-register-event-callbacks` for more information.\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    static bool example_rmt_rx_done_callback(rmt_channel_handle_t channel, const rmt_rx_done_event_data_t *edata, void *user_data)\\n    {\\n        BaseType_t high_task_wakeup = pdFALSE;\\n        QueueHandle_t receive_queue = (QueueHandle_t)user_data;\\n        // send the received RMT symbols to the parser task\\n        xQueueSendFromISR(receive_queue, edata, &high_task_wakeup);\\n        // return whether any task is woken up\\n        return high_task_wakeup == pdTRUE;\\n    }\\n\\n    QueueHandle_t receive_queue = xQueueCreate(1, sizeof(rmt_rx_done_event_data_t));\\n    rmt_rx_event_callbacks_t cbs = {\\n        .on_recv_done = example_rmt_rx_done_callback,\\n    };\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(rmt_rx_register_event_callbacks(rx_channel, &cbs, receive_queue));\\n\\n    // the following timing requirement is based on NEC protocol\\n    rmt_receive_config_t receive_config = {\\n        .signal_range_min_ns = 1250,     // the shortest duration for NEC signal is 560 µs, 1250 ns < 560 µs, valid signal is not treated as noise\\n        .signal_range_max_ns = 12000000, // the longest duration for NEC signal is 9000 µs, 12000000 ns > 9000 µs, the receive does not stop early\\n    };\\n\\n    rmt_symbol_word_t raw_symbols[64]; // 64 symbols should be sufficient for a standard NEC frame\\n    // ready to receive\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(rmt_receive(rx_channel, raw_symbols, sizeof(raw_symbols), &receive_config));\\n    // wait for the RX-done signal\\n    rmt_rx_done_event_data_t rx_data;\\n    xQueueReceive(receive_queue, &rx_data, portMAX_DELAY);\\n    // parse the received symbols\\n    example_parse_nec_frame(rx_data.received_symbols, rx_data.num_symbols);\\n\\n.. _rmt-rmt-encoder:\\n\\nRMT Encoder\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAn RMT encoder is part of the RMT TX transaction, whose responsibility is to generate and write the correct RMT symbols into hardware memory or DMA buffer at a specific time. There are some special restrictions for an encoding function:\\n\\n- During a single transaction, the encoding function may be called multiple times. This is necessary because the target RMT memory block cannot hold all the artifacts at once. To overcome this limitation, the driver utilizes a **ping-pong** approach, where the encoding session is divided into multiple parts. This means that the encoder needs to **keep track of its state** to continue encoding from where it left off in the previous part.\\n- The encoding function is running in the ISR context. To speed up the encoding session, it is highly recommended to put the encoding function into IRAM. This can also avoid the cache miss during encoding.\\n\\nTo help get started with the RMT driver faster, some commonly used encoders are provided out-of-the-box. They can either work alone or be chained together into a new encoder. See also `Composite Pattern <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern>`__ for the principle behind it. The driver has defined the encoder interface in :cpp:type:`rmt_encoder_t`, it contains the following functions:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_encoder_t::encode` is the fundamental function of an encoder. This is where the encoding session happens.\\n\\n    - The function might be called multiple times within a single transaction. The encode function should return the state of the current encoding session.\\n    - The supported states are listed in the :cpp:type:`rmt_encode_state_t`. If the result contains :cpp:enumerator:`RMT_ENCODING_COMPLETE`, it means the current encoder has finished work.\\n    - If the result contains :cpp:enumerator:`RMT_ENCODING_MEM_FULL`, the program needs to yield from the current session, as there is no space to save more encoding artifacts.\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_encoder_t::reset` should reset the encoder state back to the initial state (the RMT encoder is stateful).\\n\\n    - If the RMT transmitter is manually stopped without resetting its corresponding encoder, subsequent encoding session can be erroneous.\\n    - This function is also called implicitly in :cpp:func:`rmt_disable`.\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_encoder_t::del` should free the resources allocated by the encoder.\\n\\nCopy Encoder\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nA copy encoder is created by calling :cpp:func:`rmt_new_copy_encoder`. A copy encoder\\'s main functionality is to copy the RMT symbols from user space into the driver layer. It is usually used to encode ``const`` data, i.e., data does not change at runtime after initialization such as the leading code in the IR protocol.\\n\\nA configuration structure :cpp:type:`rmt_copy_encoder_config_t` should be provided in advance before calling :cpp:func:`rmt_new_copy_encoder`. Currently, this configuration is reserved for future expansion, and has no specific use or setting items for now.\\n\\nBytes Encoder\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nA bytes encoder is created by calling :cpp:func:`rmt_new_bytes_encoder`. The bytes encoder\\'s main functionality is to convert the user space byte stream into RMT symbols dynamically. It is usually used to encode dynamic data, e.g., the address and command fields in the IR protocol.\\n\\nA configuration structure :cpp:type:`rmt_bytes_encoder_config_t` should be provided in advance before calling :cpp:func:`rmt_new_bytes_encoder`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_bytes_encoder_config_t::bit0` and :cpp:member:`rmt_bytes_encoder_config_t::bit1` are necessary to specify the encoder how to represent bit zero and bit one in the format of :cpp:type:`rmt_symbol_word_t`.\\n- :cpp:member:`rmt_bytes_encoder_config_t::msb_first` sets the bit endianess of each byte. If it is set to true, the encoder encodes the **Most Significant Bit** first. Otherwise, it encodes the **Least Significant Bit** first.\\n\\nBesides the primitive encoders provided by the driver, the user can implement his own encoder by chaining the existing encoders together. A common encoder chain is shown as follows:\\n\\n.. blockdiag:: /../_static/diagrams/rmt/rmt_encoder_chain.diag\\n    :caption: RMT Encoder Chain\\n    :align: center\\n\\nCustomize RMT Encoder for NEC Protocol\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThis section demonstrates how to write an NEC encoder. The NEC IR protocol uses pulse distance encoding of the message bits. Each pulse burst is ``562.5 µs`` in length, logical bits are transmitted as follows. It is worth mentioning that the least significant bit of each byte is sent first.\\n\\n- Logical ``0``: a ``562.5 µs`` pulse burst followed by a ``562.5 µs`` space, with a total transmit time of ``1.125 ms``\\n- Logical ``1``: a ``562.5 µs`` pulse burst followed by a ``1.6875 ms`` space, with a total transmit time of ``2.25 ms``\\n\\nWhen a key is pressed on the remote controller, the transmitted message includes the following elements in the specified order:\\n\\n.. figure:: /../_static/ir_nec.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: IR NEC Frame\\n\\n    IR NEC Frame\\n\\n- ``9 ms`` leading pulse burst, also called the \"AGC pulse\"\\n- ``4.5 ms`` space\\n- 8-bit address for the receiving device\\n- 8-bit logical inverse of the address\\n- 8-bit command\\n- 8-bit logical inverse of the command\\n- a final ``562.5 µs`` pulse burst to signify the end of message transmission\\n\\nThen you can construct the NEC :cpp:member:`rmt_encoder_t::encode` function in the same order, for example:\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    // IR NEC scan code representation\\n    typedef struct {\\n        uint16_t address;\\n        uint16_t command;\\n    } ir_nec_scan_code_t;\\n\\n    // construct an encoder by combining primitive encoders\\n    typedef struct {\\n        rmt_encoder_t base;

In the above snippet, we use a ``switch-case`` and several ``goto`` statements to implement a `Finite-state machine <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine>`__ . With this pattern, users can construct much more complex IR protocols.\\n\\n.. _rmt-power-management:\\n\\nPower Management\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen power management is enabled, i.e., :ref:`CONFIG_PM_ENABLE` is on, the system adjusts the APB frequency before going into Light-sleep, thus potentially changing the resolution of the RMT internal counter.\\n\\nHowever, the driver can prevent the system from changing APB frequency by acquiring a power management lock of type :cpp:enumerator:`ESP_PM_APB_FREQ_MAX`. Whenever the user creates an RMT channel that has selected :cpp:enumerator:`RMT_CLK_SRC_APB` as the clock source, the driver guarantees that the power management lock is acquired after the channel enabled by :cpp:func:`rmt_enable`. Likewise, the driver releases the lock after :cpp:func:`rmt_disable` is called for the same channel. This also reveals that the :cpp:func:`rmt_enable` and :cpp:func:`rmt_disable` should appear in pairs.\\n\\nIf the channel clock source is selected to others like :cpp:enumerator:`RMT_CLK_SRC_XTAL`, then the driver does not install a power management lock for it, which is more suitable for a low-power application as long as the source clock can still provide sufficient resolution.\\n\\n.. _rmt-iram-safe:\\n\\nIRAM Safe\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy default, the RMT interrupt is deferred when the Cache is disabled for reasons like writing or erasing the main Flash. Thus the transaction-done interrupt does not get handled in time, which is not acceptable in a real-time application. What is worse, when the RMT transaction relies on **ping-pong** interrupt to successively encode or copy RMT symbols, a delayed interrupt can lead to an unpredictable result.\\n\\nThere is a Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_RMT_ISR_IRAM_SAFE` that has the following features:\\n\\n1. Enable the interrupt being serviced even when the cache is disabled\\n2. Place all functions used by the ISR into IRAM [2]_\\n3. Place the driver object into DRAM in case it is mapped to PSRAM by accident\\n\\nThis Kconfig option allows the interrupt handler to run while the cache is disabled but comes at the cost of increased IRAM consumption.\\n\\nAnother Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_RMT_RECV_FUNC_IN_IRAM` can place :cpp:func:`rmt_receive` into the IRAM as well. So that the receive function can be used even when the flash cache is disabled.\\n\\n.. _rmt-thread-safety:\\n\\nThread Safety\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe factory function :cpp:func:`rmt_new_tx_channel`, :cpp:func:`rmt_new_rx_channel` and :cpp:func:`rmt_new_sync_manager` are guaranteed to be thread-safe by the driver, which means, user can call them from different RTOS tasks without protection by extra locks.\\nOther functions that take the :cpp:type:`rmt_channel_handle_t` and :cpp:type:`rmt_sync_manager_handle_t` as the first positional parameter, are not thread-safe. which means the user should avoid calling them from multiple tasks.\\n\\nThe following functions are allowed to use under ISR context as well.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`rmt_receive`\\n\\n.. _rmt-kconfig-options:\\n\\nKconfig Options\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_RMT_ISR_IRAM_SAFE` controls whether the default ISR handler can work when cache is disabled, see also :ref:`rmt-iram-safe` for more information.\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_RMT_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG` is used to enable the debug log at the cost of increased firmware binary size.\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_RMT_RECV_FUNC_IN_IRAM` controls where to place the RMT receive function (IRAM or Flash), see :ref:`rmt-iram-safe` for more information.\\n\\nApplication Examples\\n--------------------\\n\\n* RMT-based RGB LED strip customized encoder: :example:`peripherals/rmt/led_strip`\\n* RMT IR NEC protocol encoding and decoding: :example:`peripherals/rmt/ir_nec_transceiver`\\n* RMT transactions in queue: :example:`peripherals/rmt/musical_buzzer`\\n* RMT-based stepper motor with S-curve algorithm: : :example:`peripherals/rmt/stepper_motor`\\n* RMT infinite loop for driving DShot ESC: :example:`peripherals/rmt/dshot_esc`\\n* RMT simulate 1-wire protocol (take DS18B20 as example): :example:`peripherals/rmt/onewire`\\n\\nFAQ\\n---\\n\\n* Why the RMT encoder results in more data than expected?\\n\\nThe RMT encoding takes place in the ISR context. If your RMT encoding session takes a long time (e.g., by logging debug information) or the encoding session is deferred somehow because of interrupt latency, then it is possible the transmitting becomes **faster** than the encoding. As a result, the encoder can not prepare the next data in time, leading to the transmitter sending the previous data again. There is no way to ask the transmitter to stop and wait. You can mitigate the issue by combining the following ways:\\n\\n    - Increase the :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::mem_block_symbols`, in steps of {IDF_TARGET_SOC_RMT_MEM_WORDS_PER_CHANNEL}.\\n    - Place the encoding function in the IRAM.\\n    - Enables the :cpp:member:`rmt_tx_channel_config_t::with_dma` if it is available for your chip.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/rmt_tx.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/rmt_rx.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/rmt_common.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/rmt_encoder.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/components/esp_driver_rmt/include/driver/rmt_types.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/components/hal/include/hal/rmt_types.inc\\n\\n\\n..

       " 'Two-Wire Automotive Interface (TWAI)\\n====================================\\n\\n.. -------------------------------- Overview -----------------------------------\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nThe Two-Wire Automotive Interface (TWAI) is a real-time serial communication protocol suited for automotive and industrial applications. It is compatible with ISO11898-1 Classical frames, thus can support Standard Frame Format (11-bit ID) and Extended Frame Format (29-bit ID). The {IDF_TARGET_NAME} contains {IDF_TARGET_CONFIG_SOC_TWAI_CONTROLLER_NUM} TWAI controller(s) that can be configured to communicate on a TWAI bus via an external transceiver.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    The TWAI controller is not compatible with ISO11898-1 FD Format frames, and will interpret such frames as errors.\\n\\nThis programming guide is split into the following sections:\\n\\n.. contents:: Sections\\n  :depth: 2\\n\\n.. --------------------------- Basic TWAI Concepts -----------------------------\\n\\nTWAI Protocol Summary\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe TWAI is a multi-master, multi-cast, asynchronous, serial communication protocol. TWAI also supports error detection and signalling, and inbuilt message prioritization.\\n\\n**Multi-master:** Any node on the bus can initiate the transfer of a message.\\n\\n**Multi-cast:** When a node transmits a message, all nodes on the bus will receive the message (i.e., broadcast) thus ensuring data consistency across all nodes. However, some nodes can selectively choose which messages to accept via the use of acceptance filtering (multi-cast).\\n\\n**Asynchronous:** The bus does not contain a clock signal. All nodes on the bus operate at the same bit rate and synchronize using the edges of the bits transmitted on the bus.\\n\\n**Error Detection and Signaling:** Every node constantly monitors the bus. When any node detects an error, it signals the detection by transmitting an error frame. Other nodes will receive the error frame and transmit their own error frames in response. This results in an error detection being propagated to all nodes on the bus.\\n\\n**Message Priorities:** Messages contain an ID field. If two or more nodes attempt to transmit simultaneously, the node transmitting the message with the lower ID value will win arbitration of the bus. All other nodes will become receivers ensuring that there is at most one transmitter at any time.\\n\\nTWAI Messages\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTWAI Messages are split into Data Frames and Remote Frames. Data Frames are used to deliver a data payload to other nodes, whereas a Remote Frame is used to request a Data Frame from other nodes (other nodes can optionally respond with a Data Frame). Data and Remote Frames have two frame formats known as **Extended Frame** and **Standard Frame** which contain a 29-bit ID and an 11-bit ID respectively. A TWAI message consists of the following fields:\\n\\n    - 29-bit or 11-bit ID: Determines the priority of the message (lower value has higher priority).\\n    - Data Length Code (DLC) between 0 to 8: Indicates the size (in bytes) of the data payload for a Data Frame, or the amount of data to request for a Remote Frame.\\n    - Up to 8 bytes of data for a Data Frame (should match DLC).\\n\\nError States and Counters\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe TWAI protocol implements a feature known as \"fault confinement\" where a persistently erroneous node will eventually eliminate itself from the bus. This is implemented by requiring every node to maintain two internal error counters known as the **Transmit Error Counter (TEC)** and the **Receive Error Counter (REC)**. The two error counters are incremented and decremented according to a set of rules (where the counters increase on an error, and decrease on a successful message transmission/reception). The values of the counters are used to determine a node\\'s **error state**, namely **Error Active**, **Error Passive**, and **Bus-Off**.\\n\\n**Error Active:** A node is Error Active when **both TEC and REC are less than 128** and indicates that the node is operating normally. Error Active nodes are allowed to participate in bus communications, and will actively signal the detection of any errors by automatically transmitting an **Active Error Flag** over the bus.\\n\\n**Error Passive:** A node is Error Passive when **either the TEC or REC becomes greater than or equal to 128**. Error Passive nodes are still able to take part in bus communications, but will instead transmit a **Passive Error Flag** upon detection of an error.\\n\\n**Bus-Off:** A node becomes Bus-Off when the **TEC becomes greater than or equal to 256**. A Bus-Off node is unable influence the bus in any manner (essentially disconnected from the bus) thus eliminating itself from the bus. A node will remain in the Bus-Off state until it undergoes bus-off recovery.\\n\\n.. ---------------------- Signal Lines and Transceiver -------------------------\\n\\nSignals Lines and Transceiver\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nThe TWAI controller does not contain a integrated transceiver. Therefore, to connect the TWAI controller to a TWAI bus, **an external transceiver is required**. The type of external transceiver used should depend on the application\\'s physical layer specification (e.g., using SN65HVD23x transceivers for ISO 11898-2 compatibility).\\n\\nThe TWAI controller\\'s interface consists of 4 signal lines known as **TX, RX, BUS-OFF, and CLKOUT**. These four signal lines can be routed through the GPIO Matrix to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s GPIO pads.\\n\\n.. blockdiag:: ../../../_static/diagrams/twai/controller_signals.diag\\n    :caption: Signal lines of the TWAI controller\\n    :align: center\\n\\n**TX and RX:** The TX and RX signal lines are required to interface with an external transceiver. Both signal lines represent/interpret a dominant bit as a low logic level (0 V), and a recessive bit as a high logic level (3.3 V).\\n\\n**BUS-OFF:** The BUS-OFF signal line is **optional** and is set to a low logic level (0 V) whenever the TWAI controller reaches a bus-off state. The BUS-OFF signal line is set to a high logic level (3.3 V) otherwise.\\n\\n**CLKOUT:** The CLKOUT signal line is **optional** and outputs a prescaled version of the controller\\'s source clock.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    An external transceiver **must internally loopback the TX to RX** such that a change in logic level to the TX signal line can be observed on the RX line. Failing to do so will cause the TWAI controller to interpret differences in logic levels between the two signal lines as a loss in arbitration or a bit error.\\n\\n\\n.. ------------------------------ Configuration --------------------------------\\n\\nAPI Naming Conventions\\n----------------------\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  The TWAI driver provides two sets of API. One is handle-free and is widely used in IDF versions earlier than v5.2, but it can only support one TWAI hardware controller. The other set is with handles, and the function name is usually suffixed with \"v2\", which can support any number of TWAI controllers. These two sets of API can be used at the same time, but it is recommended to use the \"v2\" version in your new projects.\\n\\nDriver Configuration\\n--------------------\\n\\nThis section covers how to configure the TWAI driver.\\n\\nOperating Modes\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe TWAI driver supports the following modes of operations:\\n\\n**Normal Mode:** The normal operating mode allows the TWAI controller to take part in bus activities such as transmitting and receiving messages/error frames. Acknowledgement from another node is required when transmitting a message.\\n\\n**No Ack Mode:** The No Acknowledgement mode is similar to normal mode, however acknowledgements are not required for a message transmission to be considered successful. This mode is useful when self testing the TWAI controller (loopback of transmissions).\\n\\n**Listen Only Mode:** This mode prevents the TWAI controller from influencing the bus. Therefore, transmission of messages/acknowledgement/error frames will be disabled. However the TWAI controller is still able to receive messages but will not acknowledge the message. This mode is suited for bus monitor applications.\\n\\nAlerts\\n^^^^^^\\n\\nThe TWAI driver contains an alert feature that is used to notify the application layer of certain TWAI controller or TWAI bus events. Alerts are selectively enabled when the TWAI driver is installed, but can be reconfigured during runtime by calling :cpp:func:`twai_reconfigure_alerts`. The application can then wait for any enabled alerts to occur by calling :cpp:func:`twai_read_alerts`. The TWAI driver supports the following alerts:\\n\\n.. list-table:: TWAI Driver Alerts\\n    :widths: 40 60\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Alert Flag\\n      - Description\\n    * - ``TWAI_ALERT_TX_IDLE``\\n      - No more messages queued for transmission\\n    * - ``TWAI_ALERT_TX_SUCCESS``\\n      - The previous transmission was successful\\n    * - ``TWAI_ALERT_RX_DATA``\\n      - A frame has been received and added to the RX queue\\n    * - ``TWAI_ALERT_BELOW_ERR_WARN``\\n      - Both error counters have dropped below error warning limit\\n    * - ``TWAI_ALERT_ERR_ACTIVE``\\n      - TWAI controller has become error active\\n    * - ``TWAI_ALERT_RECOVERY_IN_PROGRESS``\\n      - TWAI controller is undergoing bus recovery\\n    * - ``TWAI_ALERT_BUS_RECOVERED``\\n      - TWAI controller has successfully completed bus recovery\\n    * - ``TWAI_ALERT_ARB_LOST``\\n      - The previous transmission lost arbitration\\n    * - ``TWAI_ALERT_ABOVE_ERR_WARN``\\n      - One of the error counters have exceeded the error warning limit\\n    * - ``TWAI_ALERT_BUS_ERROR``\\n      - A (Bit, Stuff, CRC, Form, ACK) error has occurred on the bus\\n    * - ``TWAI_ALERT_TX_FAILED``\\n      - The previous transmission has failed\\n    * - ``TWAI_ALERT_RX_QUEUE_FULL``\\n      - The RX queue is full causing a received frame to be lost\\n    * - ``TWAI_ALERT_ERR_PASS``\\n      - TWAI controller has become error passive\\n    * - ``TWAI_ALERT_BUS_OFF``\\n      - Bus-off condition occurred. TWAI controller can no longer influence bus\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The TWAI controller\\'s **error warning limit** is used to preemptively warn the application of bus errors before the error passive state is reached. By default, the TWAI driver sets the **error warning limit** to **96**. The ``TWAI_ALERT_ABOVE_ERR_WARN`` is raised when the TEC or REC becomes larger then or equal to the error warning limit. The ``TWAI_ALERT_BELOW_ERR_WARN`` is raised when both TEC and REC return back to values below **96**.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    When enabling alerts, the ``TWAI_ALERT_AND_LOG`` flag can be used to cause the TWAI driver to log any raised alerts to UART. However, alert logging is disabled and ``TWAI_ALERT_AND_LOG`` if the :ref:`CONFIG_TWAI_ISR_IN_IRAM` option is enabled (see :ref:`placing-isr-into-iram`).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The ``TWAI_ALERT_ALL`` and ``TWAI_ALERT_NONE`` macros can also be used to enable/disable all alerts during configuration/reconfiguration.\\n\\nBit Timing\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe operating bit rate of the TWAI driver is configured using the :cpp:type:`twai_timing_config_t` structure. The period of each bit is made up of multiple **time quanta**, and the period of a **time quantum** is determined by a pre-scaled version of the TWAI controller\\'s source clock. A single bit contains the following segments in the following order:\\n\\n    1. The **Synchronization Segment** consists of a single time quantum\\n    2. **Timing Segment 1** consists of 1 to 16 time quanta before sample point\\n    3. **Timing Segment 2** consists of 1 to 8 time quanta after sample point\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_MAX_BRP:default=\"32768\", esp32=\"128\", esp32s3=\"16384\", esp32c3=\"16384\"}\\n\\nThe **Baudrate Prescaler** is used to determine the period of each time quantum by dividing the TWAI controller\\'s source clock. On the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, the ``brp`` can be **any even number from 2 to {IDF_TARGET_MAX_BRP}**. Alternatively, you can decide the resolution of each quantum, by setting :cpp:member:`twai_timing_config_t::quanta_resolution_hz` to a non-zero value. In this way, the driver can calculate the underlying ``brp`` value for you. It is useful when you set different clock sources but want the bitrate to keep the same.\\n\\nSupported clock source for a TWAI controller is listed in the :cpp:type:`twai_clock_source_t` and can be specified in :cpp:member:`twai_timing_config_t::clk_src`.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    If the ESP32 is a revision 2 or later chip, the ``brp`` will **also support any multiple of 4 from 132 to 256**, and can be enabled by setting the :ref:`CONFIG_ESP32_REV_MIN` to revision 2 or higher.\\n\\n.. packetdiag:: ../../../_static/diagrams/twai/bit_timing.diag\\n    :caption: Bit timing configuration for 500kbit/s given BRP = 8, clock source frequency is 80MHz\\n    :align: center\\n\\nThe sample point of a bit is located on the intersection of Timing Segment 1 and 2. Enabling **Triple Sampling** causes 3 time quanta to be sampled per bit instead of 1 (extra samples are located at the tail end of Timing Segment 1).\\n\\nThe **Synchronization Jump Width** is used to determine the maximum number of time quanta a single bit time can be lengthened/shortened for synchronization purposes. ``sjw`` can **range from 1 to 4**.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Multiple combinations of ``brp``, ``tseg_1``, ``tseg_2``, and ``sjw`` can achieve the same bit rate. Users should tune these values to the physical characteristics of their bus by taking into account factors such as **propagation delay, node information processing time, and phase errors**.\\n\\nBit timing **macro initializers** are also available for commonly used bit rates. The following macro initializers are provided by the TWAI driver.\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_1MBITS`\\n    - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_800KBITS`\\n    - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_500KBITS`\\n    - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_250KBITS`\\n    - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_125KBITS`\\n    - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_100KBITS`\\n    - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_50KBITS`\\n    - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_25KBITS`\\n    :not esp32: - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_20KBITS`\\n    :not esp32: - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_16KBITS`\\n    :not esp32: - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_12_5KBITS`\\n    :not esp32: - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_10KBITS`\\n    :not esp32: - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_5KBITS`\\n    :not esp32: - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_1KBITS`\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    Revision 2 or later of the ESP32 also supports the following bit rates:\\n\\n    - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_20KBITS`\\n    - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_16KBITS`\\n    - :c:macro:`TWAI_TIMING_CONFIG_12_5KBITS`\\n\\nAcceptance Filter\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe TWAI controller contains a hardware acceptance filter which can be used to filter messages of a particular ID. A node that filters out a message **does not receive the message, but will still acknowledge it**. Acceptance filters can make a node more efficient by filtering out messages sent over the bus that are irrelevant to the node. The acceptance filter is configured using two 32-bit values within :cpp:type:`twai_filter_config_t` known as the **acceptance code** and the **acceptance mask**.\\n\\nThe **acceptance code** specifies the bit sequence which a message\\'s ID, RTR, and data bytes must match in order for the message to be received by the TWAI controller. The **acceptance mask** is a bit sequence specifying which bits of the acceptance code can be ignored. This allows for a messages of different IDs to be accepted by a single acceptance code.\\n\\nThe acceptance filter can be used under **Single or Dual Filter Mode**. Single Filter Mode uses the acceptance code and mask to define a single filter. This allows for the first two data bytes of a standard frame to be filtered, or the entirety of an extended frame\\'s 29-bit ID. The following diagram illustrates how the 32-bit acceptance code and mask are interpreted under Single Filter Mode (Note: The yellow and blue fields represent standard and extended frame formats respectively).\\n\\n.. packetdiag:: ../../../_static/diagrams/twai/acceptance_filter_single.diag\\n    :caption: Bit layout of single filter mode (Right side MSBit)\\n    :align: center\\n\\n**Dual Filter Mode** uses the acceptance code and mask to define two separate filters allowing for increased flexibility of ID\\'s to accept, but does not allow for all 29-bits of an extended ID to be filtered. The following diagram illustrates how the 32-bit acceptance code and mask are interpreted under **Dual Filter Mode** (Note: The yellow and blue fields represent standard and extended frame formats respectively).\\n\\n.. packetdiag:: ../../../_static/diagrams/twai/acceptance_filter_dual.diag\\n    :caption: Bit layout of dual filter mode (Right side MSBit)\\n    :align: center\\n\\nDisabling TX Queue\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe TX queue can be disabled during configuration by setting the ``tx_queue_len`` member of :cpp:type:`twai_general_config_t` to ``0``. This allows applications that do not require message transmission to save a small amount of memory when using the TWAI driver.\\n\\n.. _placing-isr-into-iram:\\n\\nPlacing ISR into IRAM\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe TWAI driver\\'s ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) can be placed into IRAM so that the ISR can still run whilst the cache is disabled. Placing the ISR into IRAM may be necessary to maintain the TWAI driver\\'s functionality during lengthy cache disabling operations (such as SPI Flash writes, OTA updates etc). Whilst the cache is disabled, the ISR continues to:\\n\\n- Read received messages from the RX buffer and place them into the driver\\'s RX queue.\\n- Load messages pending transmission from the driver\\'s TX queue and write them into the TX buffer.\\n\\nTo place the TWAI driver\\'s ISR, users must do the following:\\n\\n- Enable the :ref:`CONFIG_TWAI_ISR_IN_IRAM` option using ``idf.py menuconfig``.\\n- When calling :cpp:func:`twai_driver_install`, the ``intr_flags`` member of :cpp:type:`twai_general_config_t` should set the :c:macro:`ESP_INTR_FLAG_IRAM` set.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    When the :ref:`CONFIG_TWAI_ISR_IN_IRAM` option is enabled, the TWAI driver will no longer log any alerts (i.e., the ``TWAI_ALERT_AND_LOG`` flag will not have any effect).\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    ESP32 Errata Workarounds\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The ESP32\\'s TWAI controller contains multiple hardware errata (more details about the errata can be found in the `ESP32\\'s ECO document <https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/eco_and_workarounds_for_bugs_in_esp32_en.pdf>`_). Some of these errata are critical, and under specific circumstances, can place the TWAI controller into an unrecoverable state (i.e., the controller gets stuck until it is reset by the CPU).\\n\\n    The TWAI driver contains software workarounds for these critical errata. With these workarounds, the ESP32 TWAI driver can operate normally, albeit with degraded performance. The degraded performance will affect users in the following ways depending on what particular errata conditions are encountered:\\n\\n    - The TWAI driver can occasionally drop some received messages.\\n    - The TWAI driver can be unresponsive for a short period of time (i.e., will not transmit or ACK for 11 bit times or longer).\\n    - If :ref:`CONFIG_TWAI_ISR_IN_IRAM` is enabled, the workarounds will increase IRAM usage by approximately 1 KB.\\n\\n    The software workarounds are enabled by default and it is recommended that users keep this workarounds enabled.\\n\\n.. ------------------------------- TWAI Driver ---------------------------------\\n\\nDriver Operation\\n----------------\\n\\nThe TWAI driver is designed with distinct states and strict rules regarding the functions or conditions that trigger a state transition. The following diagram illustrates the various states and their transitions.\\n\\n.. blockdiag:: ../../../_static/diagrams/twai/state_transition.diag\\n    :caption: State transition diagram of the TWAI driver (see table below)\\n    :align: center\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :widths: 20 40 40\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Label\\n      - Transition\\n      - Action/Condition\\n    * - A\\n      - Uninstalled > Stopped\\n      - :cpp:func:`twai_driver_install`\\n    * - B\\n      - Stopped > Uninstalled\\n      - :cpp:func:`twai_driver_uninstall`\\n    * - C\\n      - Stopped > Running\\n      - :cpp:func:`twai_start`\\n    * - D\\n      - Running > Stopped\\n      - :cpp:func:`twai_stop`\\n    * - E\\n      - Running > Bus-Off\\n      - Transmit Error Counter >= 256\\n    * - F\\n      - Bus-Off > Uninstalled\\n      - :cpp:func:`twai_driver_uninstall`\\n    * - G\\n      - Bus-Off > Recovering\\n      - :cpp:func:`twai_initiate_recovery`\\n    * - H\\n      - Recovering > Stopped\\n      - 128 occurrences of 11 consecutive recessive bits.\\n\\n\\nDriver States\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n**Uninstalled**: In the uninstalled state, no memory is allocated for the driver and the TWAI controller is powered OFF.\\n\\n**Stopped**: In this state, the TWAI controller is powered ON and the TWAI driver has been installed. However the TWAI controller is unable to take part in any bus activities such as transmitting, receiving, or acknowledging messages.\\n\\n**Running**: In the running state, the TWAI controller is able to take part in bus activities. Therefore messages can be transmitted/received/acknowledged. Furthermore, the TWAI controller is able to transmit error frames upon detection of errors on the bus.\\n\\n**Bus-Off**: The bus-off state is automatically entered when the TWAI controller\\'s Transmit Error Counter becomes greater than or equal to 256. The bus-off state indicates the occurrence of severe errors on the bus or in the TWAI controller. Whilst in the bus-off state, the TWAI controller is unable to take part in any bus activities. To exit the bus-off state, the TWAI controller must undergo the bus recovery process.\\n\\n**Recovering**: The recovering state is entered when the TWAI controller undergoes bus recovery. The TWAI controller/TWAI driver remains in the recovering state until the 128 occurrences of 11 consecutive recessive bits is observed on the bus.\\n\\nMessage Fields and Flags\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe TWAI driver distinguishes different types of messages by using the various bit field members of the :cpp:type:`twai_message_t` structure. These bit field members determine whether a message is in standard or extended format, a remote frame, and the type of transmission to use when transmitting such a message.\\n\\nThese bit field members can also be toggled using the ``flags`` member of :cpp:type:`twai_message_t` and the following message flags:\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :widths: 30 70\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Message Flag\\n      - Description\\n    * - ``TWAI_MSG_FLAG_EXTD``\\n      - Message is in Extended Frame Format (29bit ID)\\n    * - ``TWAI_MSG_FLAG_RTR``\\n      - Message is a Remote Frame (Remote Transmission Request)\\n    * - ``TWAI_MSG_FLAG_SS``\\n      - Transmit message using Single Shot Transmission (Message will not be retransmitted upon error or loss of arbitration). Unused for received message.\\n    * - ``TWAI_MSG_FLAG_SELF``\\n      - Transmit message using Self Reception Request (Transmitted message will also received by the same node). Unused for received message.\\n    * - ``TWAI_MSG_FLAG_DLC_NON_COMP``\\n      - Message\\'s Data length code is larger than 8. This will break compliance with TWAI\\n    * - ``TWAI_MSG_FLAG_NONE``\\n      - Clears all bit fields. Equivalent to a Standard Frame Format (11bit ID) Data Frame.\\n\\n.. -------------------------------- Examples -----------------------------------\\n\\nExamples\\n--------\\n\\nConfiguration &

       " 'Motor Control Pulse Width Modulator (MCPWM)\\n===========================================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\n\\nThe MCPWM peripheral is a versatile PWM generator, which contains various submodules to make it a key element in power electronic applications like motor control, digital power, and so on. Typically, the MCPWM peripheral can be used in the following scenarios:\\n\\n- Digital motor control, e.g., brushed/brushless DC motor, RC servo motor\\n- Switch mode-based digital power conversion\\n- Power DAC, where the duty cycle is equivalent to a DAC analog value\\n- Calculate external pulse width, and convert it into other analog values like speed, distance\\n- Generate Space Vector PWM (SVPWM) signals for Field Oriented Control (FOC)\\n\\nThe main submodules are listed in the following diagram:\\n\\n.. blockdiag:: /../_static/diagrams/mcpwm/mcpwm_overview.diag\\n    :caption: MCPWM Overview\\n    :align: center\\n\\n- **MCPWM Timer**: The time base of the final PWM signal. It also determines the event timing of other submodules.\\n- **MCPWM Operator**: The key module that is responsible for generating the PWM waveforms. It consists of other submodules, like comparator, PWM generator, dead time, and carrier modulator.\\n- **MCPWM Comparator**: The compare module takes the time-base count value as input, and continuously compares it to the threshold value configured. When the timer is equal to any of the threshold values, a compare event will be generated and the MCPWM generator can update its level accordingly.\\n- **MCPWM Generator**: One MCPWM generator can generate a pair of PWM waves, complementarily or independently, based on various events triggered by other submodules like MCPWM Timer and MCPWM Comparator.\\n- **MCPWM Fault**: The fault module is used to detect the fault condition from outside, mainly via the GPIO matrix. Once the fault signal is active, MCPWM Operator will force all the generators into a predefined state to protect the system from damage.\\n- **MCPWM Sync**: The sync module is used to synchronize the MCPWM timers, so that the final PWM signals generated by different MCPWM generators can have a fixed phase difference. The sync signal can be routed from the GPIO matrix or from an MCPWM Timer event.\\n- **Dead Time**: This submodule is used to insert extra delay to the existing PWM edges generated in the previous steps.\\n- **Carrier Modulation**: The carrier submodule can modulate a high-frequency carrier signal into PWM waveforms by the generator and dead time submodules. This capability is mandatory for controlling the power-switching elements.\\n- **Brake**: MCPWM operator can set how to brake the generators when a particular fault is detected. You can shut down the PWM output immediately or regulate the PWM output cycle by cycle, depending on how critical the fault is.\\n- **MCPWM Capture**: This is a standalone submodule that can work even without the above MCPWM operators. The capture consists one dedicated timer and several independent channels, with each channel connected to the GPIO. A pulse on the GPIO triggers the capture timer to store the time-base count value and then notify you by an interrupt. Using this feature, you can measure a pulse width precisely. What is more, the capture timer can also be synchronized by the MCPWM Sync submodule.\\n\\nFunctional Overview\\n-------------------\\n\\nDescription of the MCPWM functionality is divided into the following sections:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - :ref:`mcpwm-resource-allocation-and-initialization` - covers how to allocate various MCPWM objects, like timers, operators, comparators, generators and so on.

Otherwise, it will return an error code. Specifically, if a sync source has been allocated from the same timer before, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` error.\\n\\nLast but not least, to allocate a software sync source, you can call the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_soft_sync_src` function, with configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_soft_sync_config_t` as the parameter. Currently, this configuration structure is left for future purposes.\\n\\n:cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_soft_sync_src` will return a pointer to the allocated sync source object if the allocation succeeds. Otherwise, it will return an error code. Specifically, when there is no memory left for the sync source object, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NO_MEM` error. Please note, to make a software sync source take effect, do not forget to call :cpp:func:`mcpwm_soft_sync_activate`.\\n\\nOn the contrary, calling the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_del_sync_src` function will free the allocated sync source object. This function works for all types of sync sources.\\n\\nMCPWM Capture Timer and Channels\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe MCPWM group has a dedicated timer which is used to capture the timestamp when a specific event occurred. The capture timer is connected to several independent channels, each channel is assigned a GPIO.\\n\\nTo allocate a capture timer, you can call the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_capture_timer` function, with configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_capture_timer_config_t` as the parameter. The configuration structure is defined as:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_timer_config_t::group_id` sets the MCPWM group ID. The ID should belong to [0, :c:macro:`SOC_MCPWM_GROUPS` - 1] range.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_timer_config_t::clk_src` sets the clock source of the capture timer.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_timer_config_t::resolution_hz` The driver internally will set a proper divider based on the clock source and the resolution. If it is set to ``0``, the driver will pick an appropriate resolution on its own, and you can subsequently view the current timer resolution via :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_get_resolution`.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_MCPWM_CAPTURE_CLK_FROM_GROUP\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        In {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_timer_config_t::resolution_hz` parameter is invalid, the capture timer resolution is always equal to the :cpp:enumerator:`MCPWM_CAPTURE_CLK_SRC_APB`.\\n\\nThe :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_capture_timer` will return a pointer to the allocated capture timer object if the allocation succeeds. Otherwise, it will return an error code. Specifically, when there is no free capture timer left in the MCPWM group, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error. [1]_\\n\\nNext, to allocate a capture channel, you can call the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_capture_channel` function, with a capture timer handle and configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t` as the parameter. The configuration structure is defined as:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::intr_priority` sets the priority of the interrupt. If it is set to ``0``, the driver will allocate an interrupt with a default priority. Otherwise, the driver will use the given priority.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::gpio_num` sets the GPIO number used by the capture channel.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::prescale` sets the prescaler of the input signal.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::extra_flags::pos_edge` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::extra_flags::neg_edge` set whether to capture on the positive and/or falling edge of the input signal.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::extra_flags::pull_up` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::extra_flags::pull_down` set whether to pull up and/or pull down the GPIO internally.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::extra_flags::invert_cap_signal` sets whether to invert the capture signal.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::extra_flags::io_loop_back` sets whether to enable the Loop-back mode. It is for debugging purposes only. It enables both the GPIO\\'s input and output ability through the GPIO matrix peripheral.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_channel_config_t::extra_flags::keep_io_conf_at_exit` sets whether to keep the GPIO configuration when the capture channel is deleted.\\n\\nThe :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_capture_channel` will return a pointer to the allocated capture channel object if the allocation succeeds. Otherwise, it will return an error code. Specifically, when there is no free capture channel left in the capture timer, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error.\\n\\nOn the contrary, calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_del_capture_channel` and :cpp:func:`mcpwm_del_capture_timer` will free the allocated capture channel and timer object accordingly.\\n\\nMCPWM Interrupt Priority\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nMCPWM allows configuring interrupts separately for timer, operator, comparator, fault, and capture events. The interrupt priority is determined by the respective ``config_t::intr_priority``. Additionally, events within the same MCPWM group share a common interrupt source. When registering multiple interrupt events, the interrupt priorities need to remain consistent.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    When registering multiple interrupt events within an MCPWM group, the driver will use the interrupt priority of the first registered event as the MCPWM group\\'s interrupt priority.\\n\\n\\n.. _mcpwm-timer-operations-and-events:\\n\\nTimer Operations and Events\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nUpdate Period\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe timer period is initialized by the :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::period_ticks` parameter in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_config_t`. You can update the period at runtime by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_set_period` function. The new period will take effect based on how you set the :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::update_period_on_empty` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_config_t::update_period_on_sync` parameters in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_config_t`. If none of them are set, the timer period will take effect immediately.\\n\\nRegister Timer Event Callbacks\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe MCPWM timer can generate different events at runtime. If you have some function that should be called when a particular event happens, you should hook your function to the interrupt service routine by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_register_event_callbacks`. The callback function prototype is declared in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_event_cb_t`. All supported event callbacks are listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_event_callbacks_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_event_callbacks_t::on_full` sets the callback function for the timer when it counts to peak value.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_event_callbacks_t::on_empty` sets the callback function for the timer when it counts to zero.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_event_callbacks_t::on_stop` sets the callback function for the timer when it is stopped.\\n\\nThe callback functions above are called within the ISR context, so they should **not** attempt to block. For example, you may make sure that only FreeRTOS APIs with the ``ISR`` suffix are called within the function.\\n\\nThe parameter ``user_data`` of the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_register_event_callbacks` function is used to save your own context. It is passed to each callback function directly.\\n\\nThis function will lazy the install interrupt service for the MCPWM timer without enabling it. It is only allowed to be called before :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_enable`, otherwise the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` error will be returned. See also `Enable and Disable timer <#enable-and-disable-timer>`__ for more information.\\n\\nEnable and Disable Timer\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nBefore doing IO control to the timer, you need to enable the timer first, by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_enable`.  This function:\\n\\n* switches the timer state from **init** to **enable**.\\n* enables the interrupt service if it has been lazy installed by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_register_event_callbacks`.\\n* acquire a proper power management lock if a specific clock source (e.g., PLL_160M clock) is selected. See also `Power management <#power-management>`__ for more information.\\n\\nOn the contrary, calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_disable` will put the timer driver back to the **init** state, disable the interrupt service and release the power management lock.\\n\\nStart and Stop Timer\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe basic IO operation of a timer is to start and stop. Calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_start_stop` with different :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_start_stop_cmd_t` commands can start the timer immediately or stop the timer at a specific event. What is more, you can even start the timer for only one round, which means, the timer will count to peak value or zero, and then stop itself.\\n\\nConnect Timer with Operator\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe allocated MCPWM timer should be connected with an MCPWM operator by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_connect_timer`, so that the operator can take that timer as its time base, and generate the required PWM waves. Please make sure the MCPWM timer and operator are in the same group. Otherwise, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG` error.\\n\\n\\n.. _mcpwm-comparator-operations-and-events:\\n\\nComparator Operations and Events\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nRegister Comparator Event Callbacks\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe MCPWM comparator can inform you when the timer counter equals the compare value. If you have some function that should be called when this event happens, you should hook your function to the interrupt service routine by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_comparator_register_event_callbacks`. The callback function prototype is declared in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_compare_event_cb_t`. All supported event callbacks are listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_comparator_event_callbacks_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_comparator_event_callbacks_t::on_reach` sets the callback function for the comparator when the timer counter equals the compare value.\\n\\nThe callback function provides event-specific data of type :cpp:type:`mcpwm_compare_event_data_t` to you. The callback function is called within the ISR context, so it should **not** attempt to block. For example, you may make sure that only FreeRTOS APIs with the ``ISR`` suffix are called within the function.\\n\\nThe parameter ``user_data`` of :cpp:func:`mcpwm_comparator_register_event_callbacks` function is used to save your own context. It is passed to the callback function directly.\\n\\nThis function will lazy the installation of interrupt service for the MCPWM comparator, whereas the service can only be removed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_del_comparator`.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_MCPWM_SUPPORT_EVENT_COMPARATOR\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        It is not supported to register event callbacks for an **Event Comparator** because it can not generate any interrupt.\\n\\nSet Compare Value\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nYou can set the compare value for the MCPWM comparator at runtime by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_comparator_set_compare_value`. There are a few points to note:\\n\\n- A new compare value might not take effect immediately. The update time for the compare value is set by :cpp:member:`mcpwm_comparator_config_t::update_cmp_on_tez` or :cpp:member:`mcpwm_comparator_config_t::update_cmp_on_tep` or :cpp:member:`mcpwm_comparator_config_t::update_cmp_on_sync`.\\n- Make sure the operator has connected to one MCPWM timer already by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_connect_timer`. Otherwise, it will return the error code :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE`.\\n- The compare value should not exceed the timer\\'s count peak, otherwise, the compare event will never get triggered.\\n\\n\\n.. _mcpwm-generator-actions-on-events:\\n\\nGenerator Actions on Events\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSet Generator Action on Timer Event\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nOne generator can set multiple actions on different timer events, by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_timer_event` with a variable number of action configurations. The action configuration is defined in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_gen_timer_event_action_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_timer_event_action_t::direction` specifies the timer direction.

The action configuration is defined in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_gen_compare_event_action_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_compare_event_action_t::direction` specifies the timer direction.

The action configuration is defined in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_gen_fault_event_action_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_fault_event_action_t::direction` specifies the timer direction. The supported directions are listed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_direction_t`.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_fault_event_action_t::fault` specifies the fault used for the trigger. See `MCPWM Faults <#mcpwm-faults>`__ for how to allocate a fault.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_fault_event_action_t::action` specifies the generator action to be taken. The supported actions are listed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_generator_action_t`.\\n\\nWhen no free trigger slot is left in the operator to which the generator belongs, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error. [1]_\\n\\nThe trigger only support GPIO fault. when the input is not a GPIO fault, this function will return the :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED` error.\\n\\nThere is a helper macro :c:macro:`MCPWM_GEN_FAULT_EVENT_ACTION` to simplify the construction of a trigger event action entry.\\n\\nPlease note, fault event does not have variadic function like :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_fault_event`.\\n\\nSet Generator Action on Sync Event\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nOne generator can set action on sync based trigger events, by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_action_on_sync_event` with an action configurations. The action configuration is defined in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_gen_sync_event_action_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_sync_event_action_t::direction` specifies the timer direction.

The code snippet that is used to generate the waveforms is also provided below the diagram. Some general summary:\\n\\n- The **Symmetric** or **Asymmetric** of the waveforms is determined by the count mode of the MCPWM timer.\\n- The **active level** of the waveform pair is determined by the level of the PWM with a smaller duty cycle.\\n- The period of the PWM waveform is determined by the timer\\'s period and count mode.\\n- The duty cycle of the PWM waveform is determined by the generator\\'s various action combinations.\\n\\nSingle Edge Asymmetric Waveform -

This requires the use of a rectifier bridge and an inverter bridge. Each bridge arm has two power electronic devices, such as MOSFET, IGBT, etc. The two MOSFETs on the same arm can not conduct at the same time, otherwise there will be a short circuit. The fact is that, although the PWM wave shows it is turning off the switch, the MOSFET still needs a small time window to make that happen. This requires an extra delay to be added to the existing PWM wave generated by setting `Generator Actions on Events <#generator-actions-on-events>`__.\\n\\nThe dead time driver works like a **decorator**. This is also reflected in the function parameters of :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_dead_time`, where it takes the primary generator handle (``in_generator``), and returns a new generator (``out_generator``) after applying the dead time. Please note, if the ``out_generator`` and ``in_generator`` are the same, it means you are adding the time delay to the PWM waveform in an \"in-place\" fashion. In turn, if the ``out_generator`` and ``in_generator`` are different, it means you are deriving a new PWM waveform from the existing ``in_generator``.\\n\\nDead time specific configuration is listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_dead_time_config_t` structure:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_dead_time_config_t::posedge_delay_ticks` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_dead_time_config_t::negedge_delay_ticks` set the number of ticks to delay the PWM waveform on the rising and falling edge. Specifically, setting both of them to zero means bypassing the dead time module. The resolution of the dead time tick is the same as the timer that is connected with the operator by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_connect_timer`.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_dead_time_config_t::invert_output` sets whether to invert the signal after applying the dead time, which can be used to control the delay edge polarity.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    Due to the hardware limitation, one delay module (either ``posedge delay`` or ``negedge delay``) can not be applied to multiple MCPWM generators at the same time. e.g., the following configuration is **invalid**:\\n\\n    .. code:: c\\n\\n        mcpwm_dead_time_config_t dt_config = {\\n            .posedge_delay_ticks = 10,\\n        };\\n        // Set posedge delay to generator A\\n        mcpwm_generator_set_dead_time(mcpwm_gen_a, mcpwm_gen_a, &dt_config);\\n        // NOTE: This is invalid, you can not apply the posedge delay to another generator\\n        mcpwm_generator_set_dead_time(mcpwm_gen_b, mcpwm_gen_b, &dt_config);\\n\\n    However, you can apply ``posedge delay`` to generator A and ``negedge delay`` to generator B. You can also set both ``posedge delay`` and ``negedge delay`` for generator A, while letting generator B bypass the dead time module.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    It is also possible to generate the required dead time by setting `Generator Actions on Events <#generator-actions-on-events>`__, especially by controlling edge placement using different comparators. However, if the more classical edge delay-based dead time with polarity control is required, then the dead time submodule should be used.\\n\\n\\n.. _mcpwm-classical-pwm-waveforms-and-dead-time-configurations:\\n\\nDead Time Configurations for Classical PWM Waveforms\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThis section demonstrates the classical PWM waveforms that can be generated by the dead time submodule.

required (e.g., isolated digital power application) by passing the PWM output signals through transformers. Any of the PWM output signals may be at 100% duty and not changing whenever a motor is required to run steadily at the full load. Coupling with non-alternating signals with a transformer is problematic, so the signals are modulated by the carrier submodule to create an AC waveform, to make the coupling possible.\\n\\nTo configure the carrier submodule, you can call :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_apply_carrier`, and provide configuration structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::clk_src` sets the clock source of the carrier.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::frequency_hz` indicates carrier frequency in Hz.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::duty_cycle` indicates the duty cycle of the carrier. Note that, the supported choices of the duty cycle are discrete, the driver searches for the nearest one based on your configuration.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::first_pulse_duration_us` indicates the duration of the first pulse in microseconds. The resolution of the first pulse duration is determined by the carrier frequency you set in the :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::frequency_hz`. The first pulse duration can not be zero, and it has to be at least one period of the carrier. A longer pulse width can help conduct the inductance quicker.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::invert_before_modulate` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_carrier_config_t::invert_after_modulate` set whether to invert the carrier output before and after modulation.\\n\\nSpecifically, the carrier submodule can be disabled by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_apply_carrier` with a ``NULL`` configuration.\\n\\n\\n.. _mcpwm-faults-and-brake-actions:\\n\\nFaults and Brake Actions\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe MCPWM operator is able to sense external signals with information about the failure of the motor, the power driver or any other device connected. These failure signals are encapsulated into MCPWM fault objects.\\n\\nYou should determine possible failure modes of the motor and what action should be performed on detection of a particular fault, e.g., drive all outputs low for a brushed motor, lock current state for a stepper motor, etc. Because of this action, the motor should be put into a safe state to reduce the likelihood of damage caused by the fault.\\n\\nSet Operator Brake Mode on Fault\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe way that MCPWM operator reacts to the fault is called **Brake**. The MCPWM operator can be configured to perform different brake modes for each fault object by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_set_brake_on_fault`. Specific brake configuration is passed as a structure :cpp:type:`mcpwm_brake_config_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_brake_config_t::fault` sets which fault the operator should react to.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_brake_config_t::brake_mode` sets the brake mode that should be used for the fault. The supported brake modes are listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_operator_brake_mode_t`. For :cpp:enumerator:`MCPWM_OPER_BRAKE_MODE_CBC` mode, the operator recovers itself automatically as long as the fault disappears. You can specify the recovery time in :cpp:member:`mcpwm_brake_config_t::cbc_recover_on_tez` and :cpp:member:`mcpwm_brake_config_t::cbc_recover_on_tep`. For :cpp:enumerator:`MCPWM_OPER_BRAKE_MODE_OST` mode, the operator can not recover even though the fault disappears. You have to call :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_recover_from_fault` to manually recover it.\\n\\nSet Generator Action on Brake Event\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nOne generator can set multiple actions on different brake events, by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_brake_event` with a variable number of action configurations. The action configuration is defined in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_gen_brake_event_action_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_brake_event_action_t::direction` specifies the timer direction. The supported directions are listed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_direction_t`.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_brake_event_action_t::brake_mode` specifies the brake mode. The supported brake modes are listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_operator_brake_mode_t`.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_gen_brake_event_action_t::action` specifies the generator action to be taken. The supported actions are listed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_generator_action_t`.\\n\\nThere is a helper macro :c:macro:`MCPWM_GEN_BRAKE_EVENT_ACTION` to simplify the construction of a brake event action entry.\\n\\nPlease note, the argument list of :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_brake_event` **must** be terminated by :c:macro:`MCPWM_GEN_BRAKE_EVENT_ACTION_END`.\\n\\nYou can also set the brake action one by one by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_action_on_brake_event` without varargs.\\n\\nRegister Fault Event Callbacks\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe MCPWM fault detector can inform you when it detects a valid fault or a fault signal disappears. If you have some function that should be called when such an event happens, you should hook your function to the interrupt service routine by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_fault_register_event_callbacks`. The callback function prototype is declared in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_fault_event_cb_t`. All supported event callbacks are listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_fault_event_callbacks_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_fault_event_callbacks_t::on_fault_enter` sets the callback function that will be called when a fault is detected.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_fault_event_callbacks_t::on_fault_exit` sets the callback function that will be called when a fault is cleared.\\n\\nThe callback function is called within the ISR context, so it should **not** attempt to block. For example, you may make sure that only FreeRTOS APIs with the ``ISR`` suffix are called within the function.\\n\\nThe parameter ``user_data`` of :cpp:func:`mcpwm_fault_register_event_callbacks` function is used to save your own context. It is passed to the callback function directly.\\n\\nThis function will lazy the install interrupt service for the MCPWM fault, whereas the service can only be removed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_del_fault`.\\n\\nRegister Brake Event Callbacks\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe MCPWM operator can inform you when it is going to take a brake action. If you have some function that should be called when this event happens, you should hook your function to the interrupt service routine by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_register_event_callbacks`. The callback function prototype is declared in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_brake_event_cb_t`. All supported event callbacks are listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_operator_event_callbacks_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_operator_event_callbacks_t::on_brake_cbc` sets the callback function that will be called when the operator is going to take a **CBC** action.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_operator_event_callbacks_t::on_brake_ost` sets the callback function that will be called when the operator is going to take an **OST** action.\\n\\nThe callback function is called within the ISR context, so it should **not** attempt to block. For example, you may make sure that only FreeRTOS APIs with the ``ISR`` suffix are called within the function.\\n\\nThe parameter ``user_data`` of the :cpp:func:`mcpwm_operator_register_event_callbacks` function is used to save your own context. It will be passed to the callback function directly.\\n\\nThis function will lazy the install interrupt service for the MCPWM operator, whereas the service can only be removed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_del_operator`.\\n\\n\\n.. _mcpwm-generator-force-actions:\\n\\nGenerator Force Actions\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSoftware can override generator output level at runtime, by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_force_level`. The software force level always has a higher priority than other event actions set in e.g., :cpp:func:`mcpwm_generator_set_actions_on_timer_event`.\\n\\n- Set the ``level`` to -1 means to disable the force action, and the generator\\'s output level will be controlled by the event actions again.\\n- Set the ``hold_on`` to true, and the force output level will keep alive until it is removed by assigning ``level`` to -1.\\n- Set the ``hole_on`` to false, the force output level will only be active for a short time, and any upcoming event can override it.\\n\\n\\n.. _mcpwm-synchronization:\\n\\nSynchronization\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen a sync signal is taken by the MCPWM timer, the timer will be forced into a predefined **phase**, where the phase is determined by count value and count direction. You can set the sync phase by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_set_phase_on_sync`. The sync phase configuration is defined in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_timer_sync_phase_config_t` structure:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_sync_phase_config_t::sync_src` sets the sync signal source. See `MCPWM Sync Sources <#mcpwm-sync-sources>`__ for how to create a sync source object. Specifically, if this is set to ``NULL``, the driver will disable the sync feature for the MCPWM timer.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_sync_phase_config_t::count_value` sets the count value to load when the sync signal is taken.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_sync_phase_config_t::direction` sets the count direction when the sync signal is taken.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    When the MCPWM timer is working in :cpp:enumerator:`MCPWM_TIMER_COUNT_MODE_UP_DOWN` mode, special attention needs to be taken. In this mode, counter range ``[0 -> peak-1]`` belongs to the **increment** phase, and counter range ``[peak -> 1]`` belongs to the **decrement** phase. Thus if you set the :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_sync_phase_config_t::count_value` to zero, you may also want to set the :cpp:member:`mcpwm_timer_sync_phase_config_t::direction` to :cpp:enumerator:`MCPWM_TIMER_DIRECTION_UP`. Otherwise, the timer will be continue with the decrement phase, and the count value underflows to ``peak``.\\n\\nLikewise, the `MCPWM Capture Timer <#mcpwm-capture-timer-and-channels>`__ can be synced as well. You can set the sync phase for the capture timer by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_set_phase_on_sync`. The sync phase configuration is defined in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_capture_timer_sync_phase_config_t` structure:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_timer_sync_phase_config_t::sync_src` sets the sync signal source. See `MCPWM Sync Sources <#mcpwm-sync-sources>`__ for how to create a sync source object. Specifically, if this is set to ``NULL``, the driver will disable the sync feature for the MCPWM capture timer.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_timer_sync_phase_config_t::count_value` sets the count value to load when the sync signal is taken.\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_timer_sync_phase_config_t::direction` sets the count direction when the sync signal is taken. Note that, different from MCPWM Timer, the capture timer can only support one count direction: :cpp:enumerator:`MCPWM_TIMER_DIRECTION_UP`.\\n\\nSync Timers by GPIO\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n.. blockdiag::\\n    :caption: GPIO Sync All MCPWM Timers\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    blockdiag {\\n        GPIO -> Timer0, Timer1, Timer2;\\n    }\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    static void example_setup_sync_strategy(mcpwm_timer_handle_t timers[])\\n    {\\n        mcpwm_sync_handle_t gpio_sync_source = NULL;\\n        mcpwm_gpio_sync_src_config_t gpio_sync_config = {\\n            .group_id = 0,              // GPIO fault should be in the same group of the above timers\\n            .gpio_num = EXAMPLE_SYNC_GPIO,\\n            .flags.pull_down = true,\\n            .flags.active_neg = false,  // By default, a posedge pulse can trigger a sync event\\n        };\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK(mcpwm_new_gpio_sync_src(&gpio_sync_config, &gpio_sync_source));\\n\\n        mcpwm_timer_sync_phase_config_t sync_phase_config = {\\n            .count_value = 0,                      // sync phase: target count value\\n            .direction = MCPWM_TIMER_DIRECTION_UP, // sync phase: count direction\\n            .sync_src = gpio_sync_source,          // sync source\\n        };\\n        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\\n            ESP_ERROR_CHECK(mcpwm_timer_set_phase_on_sync(timers[i], &sync_phase_config));\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n\\n.. _mcpwm-capture:\\n\\nCapture\\n^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe basic functionality of MCPWM capture is to record the time when any pulse edge of the capture signal turns active. Then you can get the pulse width and convert it into other physical quantities like distance or speed in the capture callback function. For example, in the BLDC (Brushless DC, see figure below) scenario, you can use the capture submodule to sense the rotor position from the Hall sensor.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/mcpwm-bldc-control.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: MCPWM BLDC with Hall Sensor\\n\\n    MCPWM BLDC with Hall Sensor\\n\\nThe capture timer is usually connected to several capture channels. Please refer to `MCPWM Capture Timer and Channels <#mcpwm-capture-timer-and-channels>`__ for more information about resource allocation.\\n\\nRegister Capture Event Callbacks\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe MCPWM capture channel can inform you when there is a valid edge detected on the signal. You have to register a callback function to get the timer count value of the captured moment, by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_register_event_callbacks`. The callback function prototype is declared in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_capture_event_cb_t`. All supported capture callbacks are listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_capture_event_callbacks_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_event_callbacks_t::on_cap` sets the callback function for the capture channel when a valid edge is detected.\\n\\nThe callback function provides event-specific data of type :cpp:type:`mcpwm_capture_event_data_t`, so that you can get the edge of the capture signal in :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_event_data_t::cap_edge` and the count value of that moment in :cpp:member:`mcpwm_capture_event_data_t::cap_value`. To convert the capture count into a timestamp, you need to know the resolution of the capture timer by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_get_resolution`.\\n\\nThe callback function is called within the ISR context, so it should **not** attempt to block. For example, you may make sure that only FreeRTOS APIs with the ``ISR`` suffix are called within the function.\\n\\nThe parameter ``user_data`` of :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_register_event_callbacks` function is used to save your context. It is passed to the callback function directly.\\n\\nThis function will lazy install interrupt service for the MCPWM capture channel, whereas the service can only be removed in :cpp:type:`mcpwm_del_capture_channel`.\\n\\nEnable and Disable Capture Channel\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe capture channel is not enabled after allocation by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_capture_channel`. You should call :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_enable` and :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_disable` accordingly to enable or disable the channel. If the interrupt service is lazy installed during registering event callbacks for the channel in :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_register_event_callbacks`, :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_enable` will enable the interrupt service as well.\\n\\nEnable and Disable Capture Timer\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nBefore doing IO control to the capture timer, you need to enable the timer first, by calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_enable`. Internally, this function:\\n\\n* switches the capture timer state from **init** to **enable**.\\n* acquires a proper power management lock if a specific clock source (e.g., APB clock) is selected. See also `Power management <#power-management>`__ for more information.\\n\\nOn the contrary, calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_disable` will put the timer driver back to **init** state, and release the power management lock.\\n\\nStart and Stop Capture Timer\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe basic IO operation of a capture timer is to start and stop. Calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_start` can start the timer and calling :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_stop` can stop the timer immediately.\\n\\nTrigger a Software Capture Event\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nSometimes, the software also wants to trigger a \"fake\" capture event. The :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_channel_trigger_soft_catch` is provided for that purpose. Please note that, even though it is a \"fake\" capture event, it can still cause an interrupt, thus your capture event callback function gets invoked as well.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_MCPWM_SUPPORT_ETM\\n\\n    .. _mcpwm-etm-event-and-task:\\n\\n    ETM Event and Task\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    MCPWM comparator is able to generate events that can interact with the :doc:`ETM </api-reference/peripherals/etm>` module. The supported events are listed in the :cpp:type:`mcpwm_comparator_etm_event_type_t`. You can call :cpp:func:`mcpwm_comparator_new_etm_event` to get the corresponding ETM event handle.\\n\\n    For how to connect the event and task to an ETM channel, please refer to the :doc:`ETM </api-reference/peripherals/etm>` documentation.\\n\\n    .. _mcpwm-power-management:\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_MCPWM_SUPPORT_ETM\\n\\n    .. _mcpwm-power-management:\\n\\nPower Management\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen power management is enabled (i.e., :ref:`CONFIG_PM_ENABLE` is on), the system will adjust the PLL and APB frequency before going into Light-sleep, thus potentially changing the period of an MCPWM timers\\' counting step and leading to inaccurate time-keeping.\\n\\nHowever, the driver can prevent the system from changing APB frequency by acquiring a power management lock of type :cpp:enumerator:`ESP_PM_APB_FREQ_MAX`. Whenever the driver creates an MCPWM timer instance that has selected :cpp:enumerator:`MCPWM_TIMER_CLK_SRC_PLL160M` as its clock source, the driver guarantees that the power management lock is acquired when enabling the timer by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_enable`. On the contrary, the driver releases the lock when :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_disable` is called for that timer.\\n\\nLikewise, whenever the driver creates an MCPWM capture timer instance that has selected :cpp:enumerator:`MCPWM_CAPTURE_CLK_SRC_APB` as its clock source, the driver guarantees that the power management lock is acquired when enabling the timer by :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_enable`. And releases the lock in  :cpp:func:`mcpwm_capture_timer_disable`.\\n\\n\\n.. _mcpwm-iram-safe:\\n\\nIRAM Safe\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy default, the MCPWM interrupt will be deferred when the Cache is disabled for reasons like writing/erasing Flash. Thus the event callback functions will not get executed in time, which is not expected in a real-time application.\\n\\nThere is a Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_MCPWM_ISR_IRAM_SAFE` that:\\n\\n* enables the interrupt to be serviced even when the cache is disabled\\n* places all functions used by the ISR into IRAM [2]_\\n* places the driver object into DRAM (in case it is mapped to PSRAM by accident)\\n\\nThis allows the interrupt to run while the cache is disabled but comes at the cost of increased IRAM consumption.\\n\\nThere is another Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_MCPWM_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM` that can put commonly used IO control functions into IRAM as well. So, these functions can also be executable when the cache is disabled. The IO control function is as follows:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`mcpwm_comparator_set_compare_value`\\n- :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_set_period`\\n\\n\\n.. _mcpwm-thread-safety:\\n\\nThread Safety\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe factory functions like :cpp:func:`mcpwm_new_timer` are guaranteed to be thread-safe by the driver, which means, you can call it from different RTOS tasks without protection by extra locks.\\n\\nThe following function is allowed to run under the ISR context, as the driver uses a critical section to prevent them from being called concurrently in the task and ISR.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`mcpwm_comparator_set_compare_value`\\n- :cpp:func:`mcpwm_timer_set_period`\\n\\nOther functions that are not related to `Resource Allocation and Initialization  <#resource-allocation-and-initialization>`__, are not thread-safe. Thus, you should avoid calling them in different tasks without mutex protection.\\n\\n\\n.. _mcpwm-kconfig-options:\\n\\nKconfig Options\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_MCPWM_ISR_IRAM_SAFE` controls whether the default ISR handler can work when the cache is disabled, see :ref:`mcpwm-iram-safe` for more information.\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_MCPWM_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM` controls where to place the MCPWM control functions (IRAM or flash), see :ref:`mcpwm-iram-safe` for more information.\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_MCPWM_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG` is used to enable the debug log output.

       " 'Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) Calibration Driver\\n====================================================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nIn {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, the digital-to-analog converter (ADC) compares the input analog voltage to the reference, and determines each bit of the output digital result. By design, the ADC reference voltage for {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is 1100 mV. However, the true reference voltage can range from 1000 mV to 1200 mV among different chips. This guide introduces the ADC calibration driver to minimize the effect of different reference voltages, and get more accurate output results.\\n\\n\\nFunctional Overview\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe following sections of this document cover the typical steps to install and use the ADC calibration driver:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n - :ref:`adc-calibration-scheme-creation` - covers how to create a calibration scheme handle and delete the calibration scheme handle.\\n - :ref:`adc-result-conversion` - covers how to convert ADC raw result to calibrated result.\\n - :ref:`adc-thread-safety` - lists which APIs are guaranteed to be thread-safe by the driver.\\n - :ref:`Minimize Noise <adc-minimize-noise>` - describes a general way to minimize the noise.\\n :esp32: - :ref:`adc-kconfig-options` - lists the supported Kconfig options that can be used to make a different effect on driver behavior.\\n\\n\\n.. _adc-calibration-scheme-creation:\\n\\nCalibration Scheme Creation\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe ADC calibration driver provides ADC calibration scheme(s). From the calibration driver\\'s point of view, an ADC calibration scheme is created for an ADC calibration handle :cpp:type:`adc_cali_handle_t`.\\n\\n:cpp:func:`adc_cali_check_scheme` can be used to know which calibration scheme is supported on the chip. If you already know the supported schemes, this step can be skipped. Just call the corresponding function to create the scheme handle.\\n\\nIf you use your custom ADC calibration schemes, you could either modify this function :cpp:func:`adc_cali_check_scheme`, or just skip this step and call your custom creation function.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32s2 or esp32c2\\n\\n    ADC Calibration Line Fitting Scheme\\n    ```````````````````````````````````\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports :c:macro:`ADC_CALI_SCHEME_VER_LINE_FITTING` scheme. To create this scheme, set up :cpp:type:`adc_cali_line_fitting_config_t` first.\\n\\n    - :cpp:member:`adc_cali_line_fitting_config_t::unit_id`, the ADC that your ADC raw results are from.\\n    - :cpp:member:`adc_cali_line_fitting_config_t::atten`, ADC attenuation that your ADC raw results use.\\n    - :cpp:member:`adc_cali_line_fitting_config_t::bitwidth`, bit width of ADC raw result.\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32\\n\\n        There is also a configuration :cpp:member:`adc_cali_line_fitting_config_t::default_vref`. Normally this can be simply set to 0. Line Fitting scheme does not rely on this value. However, if the Line Fitting scheme required eFuse bits are not burned on your board, the driver will rely on this value to do the calibration.\\n\\n        You can use :cpp:func:`adc_cali_scheme_line_fitting_check_efuse` to check the eFuse bits. Normally the Line Fitting scheme eFuse value is :c:macro:`ADC_CALI_LINE_FITTING_EFUSE_VAL_EFUSE_TP` or :c:macro:`ADC_CALI_LINE_FITTING_EFUSE_VAL_EFUSE_VREF`. This means the Line Fitting scheme uses calibration parameters burned in the eFuse to do the calibration.\\n\\n        When the Line Fitting scheme eFuse value is :c:macro:`ADC_CALI_LINE_FITTING_EFUSE_VAL_DEFAULT_VREF`, you need to set the :cpp:member:`esp_adc_cali_line_fitting_init::default_vref`. Default vref is an estimate of the ADC reference voltage provided as a parameter during calibration.\\n\\n    After setting up the configuration structure, call :cpp:func:`adc_cali_create_scheme_line_fitting` to create a Line Fitting calibration scheme handle.\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32s2\\n\\n        This function may fail due to reasons such as :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG` or :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NO_MEM`.

       " 'Digital Signature (DS)\\n======================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThe Digital Signature (DS) module provides hardware acceleration of signing messages based on RSA. It uses pre-encrypted parameters to calculate a signature. The parameters are encrypted using HMAC as a key-derivation function. In turn, the HMAC uses eFuses as the input key. The whole process happens in hardware so that neither the decryption key for the RSA parameters nor the input key for the HMAC key derivation function can be seen by the software while calculating the signature.\\n\\nFor more detailed information on the hardware involved in the signature calculation and the registers used, see **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **Digital Signature (DS)** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#digsig>`__].\\n\\n\\nPrivate Key Parameters\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe private key parameters for the RSA signature are stored in flash. To prevent unauthorized access, they are AES-encrypted. The HMAC module is used as a key-derivation function to calculate the AES encryption key for the private key parameters. In turn, the HMAC module uses a key from the eFuses key block which can be read-protected to prevent unauthorized access as well.\\n\\nUpon signature calculation invocation, the software only specifies which eFuse key to use, the corresponding eFuse key purpose, the location of the encrypted RSA parameters, and the message.\\n\\nKey Generation\\n--------------\\n\\nBoth the HMAC key and the RSA private key have to be created and stored before the DS peripheral can be used. This needs to be done in software on the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} or alternatively on a host. For this context, ESP-IDF provides :cpp:func:`esp_efuse_write_block` to set the HMAC key and :cpp:func:`esp_hmac_calculate` to encrypt the private RSA key parameters.\\n\\nYou can find instructions on how to calculate and assemble the private key parameters in **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **Digital Signature (DS)** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#digsig>`__].\\n\\nSignature Calculation with ESP-IDF\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nFor more detailed information on the workflow and the registers used, see **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **Digital Signature (DS)** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#digsig>`__].\\n\\nThree parameters need to be prepared to calculate the digital signature:\\n\\n#. The eFuse key block ID which is used as the key for the HMAC\\n#. The location of the encrypted private key parameters\\n#. The message to be signed\\n\\nSince the signature calculation takes some time, there are two possible API versions to use in ESP-IDF. The first one is :cpp:func:`esp_ds_sign` and simply blocks until the calculation is finished. If software needs to do something else during the calculation, :cpp:func:`esp_ds_start_sign` can be called, followed by periodic calls to :cpp:func:`esp_ds_is_busy` to check when the calculation has finished. Once the calculation has finished, :cpp:func:`esp_ds_finish_sign` can be called to get the resulting signature.\\n\\nThe APIs :cpp:func:`esp_ds_sign` and :cpp:func:`esp_ds_start_sign` calculate a plain RSA signature with the help of the DS peripheral. This signature needs to be converted to an appropriate format for further use. For example, the MbedTLS SSL stack supports PKCS#1 format. The API :cpp:func:`esp_ds_rsa_sign` can be used to obtain the signature directly in the PKCS#1 v1.5 format. It internally uses :cpp:func:`esp_ds_start_sign` and converts the signature into PKCS#1 v1.5 format.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    This is only the basic DS building block, the message length is fixed. To create signatures of arbitrary messages, the input is normally a hash of the actual message, padded up to the required length. An API to do this is planned in the future.\\n\\n.. _configure-the-ds-peripheral:\\n\\nConfigure the DS Peripheral for a TLS Connection\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe DS peripheral on {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip must be configured before it can be used for a TLS connection. The configuration involves the following steps:\\n\\n1) Randomly generate a 256-bit value called the ``Initialization Vector`` (IV).\\n2) Randomly generate a 256-bit value called the ``HMAC_KEY``.\\n3) Calculate the encrypted private key parameters from the client private key (RSA) and the parameters generated in the above steps.\\n4) Then burn the 256-bit ``HMAC_KEY`` on the eFuse, which can only be read by the DS peripheral.\\n\\nFor more details, see **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **Digital Signature (DS)** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#digsig>`__].\\n\\nTo configure the DS peripheral for development purposes, you can use the `esp-secure-cert-tool <https://pypi.org/project/esp-secure-cert-tool>`_.\\n\\nThe encrypted private key parameters obtained after the DS peripheral configuration are then to be kept in flash. Furthermore, they are to be passed to the DS peripheral which makes use of those parameters for the Digital Signature operation. The application then needs to read the DS data from the flash, which has been done through the APIs provided by the `esp_secure_cert_mgr <https://github.com/espressif/esp_secure_cert_mgr>`_ component. Please refer to the `component/README <https://github.com/espressif/esp_secure_cert_mgr#readme>`_ for more details.\\n\\nThe process of initializing the DS peripheral and then performing the Digital Signature operation is done internally with the help of `ESP-TLS`. Please refer to :ref:`digital-signature-with-esp-tls` for more details.\\n\\nAs mentioned in the `ESP-TLS` documentation, the application only needs to provide the encrypted private key parameters to the esp_tls context (as `ds_data`), which internally performs all necessary operations for initializing the DS peripheral and then performing the DS operation.\\n\\nExample for SSL Mutual Authentication Using DS\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe example :example:`protocols/mqtt/ssl_ds` shows how to use the DS peripheral for mutual authentication. The example uses `mqtt_client` (Implemented through `ESP-MQTT`) to connect to broker ``test.mosquitto.org`` using SSL transport with mutual authentication. The SSL part is internally performed with `ESP-TLS`.

       " 'Touch Element\\n=============\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nThe Touch Element Library is a highly abstracted element library designed on the basis of the touch sensor driver. The library provides a unified and user-friendly software interface to quickly build capacitive touch sensor applications. For more information about the touch sensor driver API, see :doc:`../peripherals/touch_pad`.\\n\\nArchitecture\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe Touch Element library configures touch sensor peripherals via the touch sensor driver. However, some necessary hardware parameters should be passed to :cpp:func:`touch_element_install` and will be configured automatically only after calling :cpp:func:`touch_element_start`. This sequential order is essential because configuring these parameters has a significant impact on the run-time system. Therefore, they must be configured after calling the start function to ensure the system functions properly.\\n\\nThese parameters include touch channel threshold, driver-level of waterproof shield sensor, etc. The Touch Element library sets the touch sensor interrupt and the esp_timer routine up, and the hardware information of the touch sensor (channel state, channel number) will be obtained in the touch sensor interrupt service routine. When the specified channel event occurs, the hardware information is passed to the esp_timer callback routine, which then dispatches the touch sensor channel information to the touch elements (such as button, slider, etc.). The library then runs a specified algorithm to update the touch element\\'s state or calculate its position and dispatches the result accordingly.\\n\\nSo when using the Touch Element library, you are relieved from the implementation details of the touch sensor peripheral. The library handles most of the hardware information and passes the more meaningful messages to the event handler routine.\\n\\nThe workflow of the Touch Element library is illustrated in the picture below.\\n\\n.. figure:: /../_static/touch_element/te_architecture.svg\\n    :scale: 100 %\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    Touch Element architecture\\n\\n\\nThe features in relation to the Touch Element library in {IDF_TARGET_NAME} are given in the table below.\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n    :widths: 70 30\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    * -

When the difference between the Smooth signal and the Benchmark signal becomes greater than the threshold value (i.e., ``(smooth - benchmark) > threshold``), the touch channel\\'s state will be changed and a touch interrupt will be triggered simultaneously.\\n\\n.. figure:: /../_static/touch_element/te_threshold.svg\\n    :scale: 40 %\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    Touch sensor signal threshold\\n\\n\\nSensitivity\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nImportant performance parameter of the touch sensor, the larger it is, the better touch the sensor performs. It could be calculated by the format below:\\n\\n.. math::\\n\\n    Sensitivity = \\\\frac{Signal_{press} - Signal_{release}}{Signal_{release}} = \\\\frac{Signal_{delta}}{Signal_{benchmark}}\\n\\n\\nWaterproof\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWaterproof is the hardware feature of a touch sensor which has a guard sensor and shield sensor (always connect to Channel 14) that has the ability to resist a degree of influence of water drop and detect the water stream.\\n\\n\\nTouch Button\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe touch button consumes one channel of the touch sensor, and it looks like as the picture below:\\n\\n\\n.. figure:: /../_static/touch_element/te_button.svg\\n    :scale: 100 %\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    Touch button\\n\\n\\nTouch Slider\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe touch slider consumes several channels (at least three channels) of the touch sensor, the more channels consumed, the higher resolution and accuracy position it performs. The touch slider looks like as the picture below:\\n\\n.. figure:: /../_static/touch_element/te_slider.svg\\n    :scale: 100 %\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    Touch slider\\n\\n\\nTouch Matrix\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe touch matrix button consumes several channels (at least 2 + 2 = 4 channels), and it gives a solution to use fewer channels and get more buttons. {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports up to 49 buttons. The touch matrix button looks like as the picture below:\\n\\n.. figure:: /../_static/touch_element/te_matrix.svg\\n    :scale: 100 %\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    Touch matrix\\n\\n\\nTouch Element Library Usage\\n---------------------------\\n\\nUsing this library should follow the initialization flow below:\\n\\n1. To initialize the Touch Element library by calling :cpp:func:`touch_element_install`.\\n2. To initialize touch elements (button/slider etc) by calling :cpp:func:`touch_xxxx_install`.\\n3. To create a new element instance by calling :cpp:func:`touch_xxxx_create`.\\n4. To subscribe events by calling :cpp:func:`touch_xxxx_subscribe_event`.\\n5. To choose a dispatch method by calling :cpp:func:`touch_xxxx_set_dispatch_method` that tells the library how to notify you while the subscribed event occurs.\\n6. If dispatch by callback, call :cpp:func:`touch_xxxx_set_callback` to set the event handler function.\\n7. To start the Touch Element library by calling :cpp:func:`touch_element_start`.\\n8. If dispatch by callback, the callback will be called by the driver core when an event happens, no need to do anything; If dispatch by event task, create an event task and call :cpp:func:`touch_element_message_receive` to obtain messages in a loop.\\n9. (Optional) If you want to suspend the Touch Element run-time system or for some reason that could not obtain the touch element message, :cpp:func:`touch_element_stop` should be called to suspend the Touch Element system and then resume it by calling :cpp:func:`touch_element_start` again.\\n\\nIn code, the flow above may look like as follows:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    static touch_xxx_handle_t element_handle; //Declare a touch element handle\\n\\n    //Define the subscribed event handler\\n    void event_handler(touch_xxx_handle_t out_handle, touch_xxx_message_t out_message, void *arg)\\n    {\\n        //Event handler logic\\n    }\\n\\n    void app_main()\\n    {\\n        //Using the default initializer to config Touch Element library\\n        touch_elem_global_config_t global_config = TOUCH_ELEM_GLOBAL_DEFAULT_CONFIG();\\n        touch_element_install(&global_config);\\n\\n        //Using the default initializer to config Touch elements\\n        touch_xxx_global_config_t elem_global_config = TOUCH_XXXX_GLOBAL_DEFAULT_CONFIG();\\n        touch_xxx_install(&elem_global_config);\\n\\n        //Create a new instance\\n        touch_xxx_config_t element_config = {\\n            ...\\n            ...\\n        };\\n        touch_xxx_create(&element_config, &element_handle);\\n\\n        //Subscribe the specified events by using the event mask\\n        touch_xxx_subscribe_event(element_handle, TOUCH_ELEM_EVENT_ON_PRESS | TOUCH_ELEM_EVENT_ON_RELEASE, NULL);\\n\\n        //Choose CALLBACK as the dispatch method\\n        touch_xxx_set_dispatch_method(element_handle, TOUCH_ELEM_DISP_CALLBACK);\\n\\n        //Register the callback routine\\n        touch_xxx_set_callback(element_handle, event_handler);\\n\\n        //Start Touch Element library processing\\n        touch_element_start();\\n    }\\n\\n\\nInitialization\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n1. To initialize the Touch Element library, you have to configure the touch sensor peripheral and Touch Element library by calling :cpp:func:`touch_element_install` with :cpp:type:`touch_elem_global_config_t`, the default initializer is available in :cpp:func:`TOUCH_ELEM_GLOBAL_DEFAULT_CONFIG` and this default configuration is suitable for the most general application scene, and it is suggested not to change the default configuration before fully understanding Touch Sensor peripheral because some changes might bring several impacts to the system.\\n\\n2. To initialize the specified element, all the elements will not work before its constructor :cpp:func:`touch_xxxx_install` is called so as to save memory, so you have to call the constructor of each used touch element respectively, to set up the specified element.\\n\\n\\nTouch Element Instance Startup\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n1. To create a new touch element instance, call :cpp:func:`touch_xxxx_create`, select a channel, and provide its `Sensitivity`_ value for the new element instance.\\n\\n2. To subscribe to events, call :cpp:func:`touch_xxxx_subscribe_event`. The Touch Element library offers several events, and the event mask is available in :idf_file:`components/touch_element/include/touch_element/touch_element.h`. You can use these event masks to subscribe to specific events individually or combine them to subscribe to multiple events.\\n\\n3. To configure the dispatch method, use :cpp:func:`touch_xxxx_set_dispatch_method`. The Touch Element library provides two dispatch methods: :cpp:enumerator:`TOUCH_ELEM_DISP_EVENT` and :cpp:enumerator:`TOUCH_ELEM_DISP_CALLBACK`. These methods allow you to obtain the touch element message and handle it using different approaches.\\n\\nEvents Processing\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf :cpp:enumerator:`TOUCH_ELEM_DISP_EVENT` dispatch method is configured, you need to start up an event handler task to obtain the touch element message, all the elements\\' raw message could be obtained by calling :cpp:func:`touch_element_message_receive`, then extract the element-class-specific message by calling the corresponding message decoder with :cpp:func:`touch_xxxx_get_message` to get the touch element\\'s extracted message; If :cpp:enumerator:`TOUCH_ELEM_DISP_CALLBACK` dispatch method is configured, you need to pass an event handler by calling :cpp:func:`touch_xxxx_set_callback` before the touch element starts working, all the element\\'s extracted message will be passed to the event handler function.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    Since the event handler function runs on the core of the element library, i.e., in the esp_timer callback routine, please avoid performing operations that may cause blocking or delays, such as calling :cpp:func:`vTaskDelay`.\\n\\n\\nIn code, the events handle procedure may look like as follows:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    /* ---------------------------------------------- TOUCH_ELEM_DISP_EVENT ----------------------------------------------- */\\n    void element_handler_task(void *arg)\\n    {\\n        touch_elem_message_t element_message;\\n        while(1) {\\n            if (touch_element_message_receive(&element_message, Timeout) == ESP_OK) {\\n                const touch_xxxx_message_t *extracted_message = touch_xxxx_get_message(&element_message); //Decode message\\n                ... //Event handler logic\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n    void app_main()\\n    {\\n        ...\\n\\n        touch_xxxx_set_dispatch_method(element_handle, TOUCH_ELEM_DISP_EVENT);  //Set TOUCH_ELEM_DISP_EVENT as the dispatch method\\n        xTaskCreate(&element_handler_task, \"element_handler_task\", 2048, NULL, 5, NULL);  //Create a handler task\\n\\n        ...\\n    }\\n    /* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */\\n\\n    ...\\n    /* ---------------------------------------------- TOUCH_ELEM_DISP_CALLBACK ----------------------------------------------- */\\n    void element_handler(touch_xxxx_handle_t out_handle, touch_xxxx_message_t out_message, void *arg)\\n    {\\n        //Event handler logic\\n    }\\n\\n    void app_main()\\n    {\\n        ...\\n\\n        touch_xxxx_set_dispatch_method(element_handle, TOUCH_ELEM_DISP_CALLBACK);  //Set TOUCH_ELEM_DISP_CALLBACK as the dispatch method\\n        touch_xxxx_set_callback(element_handle, element_handler);  //Register an event handler function\\n\\n        ...\\n    }\\n    /* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- */\\n\\n\\nWaterproof Usage\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n1. The waterproof shield sensor is always-on after Touch Element waterproof is initialized, however, the waterproof guard sensor is optional, hence if the you do not need the guard sensor, ``TOUCH_WATERPROOF_GUARD_NOUSE`` has to be passed to :cpp:func:`touch_element_waterproof_install` by the configuration struct.\\n\\n2. To associate the touch element with the guard sensor, pass the touch element\\'s handle to the Touch Element waterproof\\'s masked list by calling :cpp:func:`touch_element_waterproof_add`. By associating a touch element with the Guard sensor, the touch element will be disabled when the guard sensor is triggered by a stream of water so as to protect the touch element.\\n\\nThe Touch Element Waterproof example is available in :example:`peripherals/touch_sensor/touch_element/touch_element_waterproof` directory.\\n\\nIn code, the waterproof configuration may look as follows:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    void app_main()\\n    {\\n        ...\\n\\n        touch_xxxx_install();                 //Initialize instance (button, slider, etc)\\n        touch_xxxx_create(&element_handle);  //Create a new Touch element\\n\\n        ...\\n\\n        touch_element_waterproof_install();              //Initialize Touch Element waterproof\\n        touch_element_waterproof_add(element_handle);   //Let an element associate with the guard sensor\\n\\n        ...\\n    }\\n\\nWakeup from Light/Deep-sleep Mode\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nOnly Touch Button can be configured as a wake-up source.\\n\\nLight- or Deep-sleep modes are both supported to be wakened up by a touch sensor. For the Light-sleep mode, any installed touch button can wake it up. But only the sleep button can wake up from Deep-sleep mode, and the touch sensor will do a calibration immediately, the reference value will be calibrated to a wrong value if our finger does not remove timely. Though the wrong reference value recovers after the finger removes away and has no effect on the driver logic, if you do not want to see a wrong reference value while waking up from Deep-sleep mode, you can call :cpp:func:`touch_element_sleep_enable_wakeup_calibration` to disable the wakeup calibration.\\n\\nThe Touch Element Wakeup example is available in `system/light_sleep` directory.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    void app_main()\\n    {\\n        ...\\n        touch_element_install();\\n        touch_button_install();                 //Initialize the touch button\\n        touch_button_create(&element_handle);  //Create a new Touch element\\n\\n        ...\\n\\n        // ESP_ERROR_CHECK(touch_element_enable_light_sleep(&sleep_config));\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK(touch_element_enable_deep_sleep(button_handle[0], &sleep_config));\\n        // ESP_ERROR_CHECK(touch_element_sleep_enable_wakeup_calibration(button_handle[0], false)); // (optional) Disable wakeup calibration to prevent updating the baseline to a wrong value\\n\\n        touch_element_start();\\n\\n        ...\\n    }\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\nAll the Touch Element library examples could be found in the :example:`peripherals/touch_sensor/touch_element` directory of ESP-IDF examples.\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference - Touch Element Core\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/touch_element.inc\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference - Touch Button\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/touch_button.inc\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference - Touch Slider\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/touch_slider.inc\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference - Touch Matrix\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/touch_matrix.inc\\n',\n",

Then it covers the clock tree APIs that can be called to monitor the status of the module clocks at runtime.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nThis section lists definitions of {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s supported root clocks and module clocks. These definitions are commonly used in the driver configuration, to help select a proper source clock for the peripheral.\\n\\nRoot Clocks\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nRoot clocks generate reliable clock signals. These clock signals then pass through various gates, muxes, dividers, or multipliers to become the clock sources for every functional module: the CPU core(s), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, the RTC, and the peripherals.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s root clocks are listed in :cpp:type:`soc_root_clk_t`:\\n\\n    .. list::\\n\\n        - Internal {IDF_TARGET_RC_FAST_VAGUE_FREQ} MHz RC Oscillator (RC_FAST)\\n\\n            This RC oscillator generates a about {IDF_TARGET_RC_FAST_ADJUSTED_FREQ} MHz clock signal output as the ``RC_FAST_CLK``.\\n\\n            .. only:: SOC_CLK_RC_FAST_D256_SUPPORTED\\n\\n                The about {IDF_TARGET_RC_FAST_ADJUSTED_FREQ} MHz signal output is also passed into a configurable divider, which by default divides the input clock frequency by 256, to generate a ``RC_FAST_D256_CLK``.\\n\\n                The exact frequency of ``RC_FAST_CLK`` can be computed in runtime through calibration on the ``RC_FAST_D256_CLK``.\\n\\n            .. only:: not SOC_CLK_RC_FAST_D256_SUPPORTED and SOC_CLK_RC_FAST_SUPPORT_CALIBRATION\\n\\n                The exact frequency of ``RC_FAST_CLK`` can be computed in runtime through calibration.\\n\\n            .. only:: not SOC_CLK_RC_FAST_SUPPORT_CALIBRATION\\n\\n                The exact frequency of ``RC_FAST_CLK`` cannot be computed in runtime through calibration, but it is still possible to get its frequency through an oscilloscope or a logic analyzer by routing the clock signal to a GPIO pin.\\n\\n        - External {IDF_TARGET_XTAL_FREQ} MHz Crystal (XTAL)\\n\\n        - Internal {IDF_TARGET_RC_SLOW_VAGUE_FREQ} kHz RC Oscillator (RC_SLOW)\\n\\n            This RC oscillator generates a about {IDF_TARGET_RC_SLOW_VAGUE_FREQ}kHz clock signal output as the ``RC_SLOW_CLK``.

The external signal must be connected to the ``32K_XN`` pin. Additionally, a 1 nF capacitor must be placed between the ``32K_XP`` pin and ground. In this case, the ``32K_XP`` pin cannot be used as a GPIO pin.\\n\\n                .. only:: esp32p4\\n\\n                    The clock source for this ``XTAL32K_CLK`` is a 32 kHz crystal connecting to the ``XTAL_32K_P`` and ``XTAL_32K_N`` pins.\\n\\n                .. only:: not esp32 and not esp32p4\\n\\n                     The clock source for this ``XTAL32K_CLK`` can be either a 32 kHz crystal connecting to the ``XTAL_32K_P`` and ``XTAL_32K_N`` pins or a 32 kHz clock signal generated by an external circuit.

       " 'Digital To Analog Converter (DAC)\\n=================================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_DAC_CH_1: default = \"Not Updated!\", esp32 = \"GPIO25\", esp32s2 = \"GPIO17\"}\\n{IDF_TARGET_DAC_CH_2: default = \"Not Updated!\", esp32 = \"GPIO26\", esp32s2 = \"GPIO18\"}\\n{IDF_TARGET_DAC_REF_PIN: default = \"Not Updated!\", esp32 = \"VDD3P3_RTC\", esp32s2 = \"VDD3P3_RTC_IO\"}\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} has two 8-bit DAC (digital to analog converter) channels respectively connected to {IDF_TARGET_DAC_CH_1} (Channel 1) and {IDF_TARGET_DAC_CH_2} (Channel 2). Each DAC channel can convert the digital value 0~255 to the analog voltage 0~Vref (The reference voltage \\'Vref\\' here is input from the pin {IDF_TARGET_DAC_REF_PIN}, which ideally equals to the power supply VDD). The output voltage can be calculated as the following::\\n\\n    out_voltage = Vref * digi_val / 255\\n\\nThe DAC peripheral supports outputting analog signal in the following ways:\\n\\n1. Outputting a voltage directly. The DAC channel keeps outputting a specified voltage.\\n2. Outputting continuous analog signal by DMA. The DAC converts the data in a buffer at a specified frequency.\\n3. Outputting a cosine wave by the cosine wave generator. The DAC channel can output a cosine wave with specified frequency and amplitude.\\n\\nFor other analog output options, see :doc:`Sigma-Delta Modulation <sdm>` and :doc:`LED Control <ledc>`. Both modules produce high-frequency PWM/PDM output, which can be hardware low-pass filtered in order to generate a lower frequency analog output.\\n\\nDAC File Structure\\n------------------\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/diagrams/dac/dac_file_structure.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: DAC file structure\\n\\n    DAC File Structure\\n\\n\\n**Public headers that need to be included in the DAC application are listed as follows:**\\n\\n- ``dac.h``: The top header file of the legacy DAC driver, which should be only included in the apps which use the legacy driver API.\\n- ``dac_oneshot.h``: The top header file of the new DAC driver, which should be included in the apps which use the new driver API with one-shot mode.\\n- ``dac_cosine.h``: The top header file of the new DAC driver, which should be included in the apps which use the new driver API with cosine mode.\\n- ``dac_continuous.h``: The top header file of the new DAC driver, which should be included in the apps which use the new driver API with continuous mode.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The legacy driver cannot coexist with the new driver. Include ``dac.h`` to use the legacy driver or ``dac_oneshot.h``, ``dac_cosine.h``, and ``dac_continuous.h`` to use the new driver. The legacy driver might be removed in the future.\\n\\nFunctional Overview\\n-------------------\\n\\nResources Management\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe DAC on {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has two channels. The channels have separate software resources and can be managed by :cpp:type:`dac_oneshot_handle_t`, :cpp:type:`dac_cosine_handle_t`, or :cpp:type:`dac_continuous_handle_t` according to the usage. Registering different modes on a same DAC channel is not allowed.\\n\\nDirect Voltage Output (One-shot/Direct Mode)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe DAC channels in the group can convert an 8-bit digital value into the analog when :cpp:func:`dac_oneshot_output_voltage` is called (it can be called in ISR). The analog voltage is kept on the DAC channel until the next conversion starts. To start the voltage conversion, the DAC channels need to be enabled first through registering by :cpp:func:`dac_oneshot_new_channel`.\\n\\nContinuous Wave Output (Continuous/DMA Mode)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nDAC channels can convert digital data continuously via the DMA. There are three ways to write the DAC data:\\n\\n    1. Normal writing (synchronous): Data can be transmitted at one time and kept blocked until all the data has been loaded into the DMA buffer, and the voltage is kept as the last conversion value while no more data is inputted. It is usually used to transport a long signal like an audio. To convert data continuously, the continuous channel handle need to be allocated by calling :cpp:func:`dac_continuous_new_channels` and the DMA conversion should be enabled by calling :cpp:func:`dac_continuous_enable`. Then data can be written by :cpp:func:`dac_continuous_write` synchronously. Refer to :example:`peripherals/dac/dac_continuous/dac_audio` for examples.\\n    2. Cyclical writing: A piece of data can be converted cyclically without blocking, and no more operation is needed after the data are loaded into the DMA buffer. But note that the inputted buffer size is limited by the number of descriptors and the DMA buffer size. It is usually used to transport short signals that need to be repeated, e.g., a sine wave. To achieve cyclical writing, call :cpp:func:`dac_continuous_write_cyclically` after the DAC continuous mode is enabled. Refer to :example:`peripherals/dac/dac_continuous/signal_generator` for examples.\\n    3. Asynchronous writing: Data can be transmitted asynchronously based on the event callback. :cpp:member:`dac_event_callbacks_t::on_convert_done` must be registered to use asynchronous mode. Users can get the :cpp:type:`dac_event_data_t` in the callback which contains the DMA buffer address and length, allowing them to load the data into the buffer directly. To use the asynchronous writing, call :cpp:func:`dac_continuous_register_event_callback` to register the :cpp:member:`dac_event_callbacks_t::on_convert_done` before enabling, and then :cpp:func:`dac_continuous_start_async_writing` to start the asynchronous writing. Note that once the asynchronous writing is started, the callback function will be triggered continuously. Call :cpp:func:`dac_continuous_write_asynchronously` to load the data either in a separate task or in the callback directly. Refer to :example:`peripherals/dac/dac_continuous/dac_audio` for examples.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    On ESP32, the DAC digital controller can be connected internally to the I2S0 and use its DMA for continuous conversion. Although the DAC only needs 8-bit data for conversion, it has to be the left-shifted 8 bits (i.e., the high 8 bits in a 16-bit slot) to satisfy the I2S communication format. By default, the driver helps to expand the data to 16-bit wide automatically. To expand manually, please disable :ref:`CONFIG_DAC_DMA_AUTO_16BIT_ALIGN` in the menuconfig.\\n\\n    The clock of the DAC digital controller comes from I2S0 as well, so there are two clock sources for selection:\\n\\n    - :cpp:enumerator:`dac_continuous_digi_clk_src_t::DAC_DIGI_CLK_SRC_PLL_D2` supports frequency between 19.6 KHz to several MHz. It is the default clock which can also be selected by :cpp:enumerator:`dac_continuous_digi_clk_src_t::DAC_DIGI_CLK_SRC_DEFAULT`.\\n    - :cpp:enumerator:`dac_continuous_digi_clk_src_t::DAC_DIGI_CLK_SRC_APLL` supports frequency between 648 Hz to several MHz. However, it might be occupied by other peripherals, thus not providing the required frequency. In such case, this clock source is available only if APLL still can be correctly divided into the target DAC DMA frequency.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s2\\n\\n    On ESP32-S2, the DAC digital controller can be connected internally to the SPI3 and use its DMA for continuous conversion.\\n\\n    The clock sources of the DAC digital controller include:\\n\\n    - :cpp:enumerator:`dac_continuous_digi_clk_src_t::DAC_DIGI_CLK_SRC_APB` supports frequency between 77 Hz to several MHz. It is the default clock which can also be selected by :cpp:enumerator:`dac_continuous_digi_clk_src_t::DAC_DIGI_CLK_SRC_DEFAULT`.\\n    - :cpp:enumerator:`dac_continuous_digi_clk_src_t::DAC_DIGI_CLK_SRC_APLL` supports frequency between 6 Hz to several MHz. However, it might be occupied by other peripherals, thus not providing the required frequency. In such case, this clock source is available only if APLL still can be correctly divided into the target DAC DMA frequency.\\n\\n\\nCosine Wave Output (Cosine Mode)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe DAC peripheral has a cosine wave generator, which can generate cosine wave on the channels. Users can specify the frequency, amplitude, and phase of the cosine wave. To output the cosine wave, please acquire the DAC to cosine mode using :cpp:func:`dac_cosine_new_channel`, and then start the cosine wave generator by :cpp:func:`dac_cosine_start`.\\n\\nCurrently, the clock source of the cosine wave generator only comes from ``RTC_FAST`` which can be selected by :cpp:enumerator:`dac_cosine_clk_src_t::DAC_COSINE_CLK_SRC_RTC_FAST`. It is also the default clock source which is the same as :cpp:enumerator:`dac_cosine_clk_src_t::DAC_COSINE_CLK_SRC_RTC_DEFAULT`.\\n\\nPower Management\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen the power management is enabled (i.e., :ref:`CONFIG_PM_ENABLE` is on), the system will adjust or stop the clock source of DAC before entering Light-sleep mode, thus potential influence to the DAC signals may lead to false data conversion.\\n\\nWhen using DAC driver in continuous mode, it can prevent the system from changing or stopping the clock source in DMA or cosine mode by acquiring a power management lock. When the clock source is generated from APB, the lock type will be set to :cpp:enumerator:`esp_pm_lock_type_t::ESP_PM_APB_FREQ_MAX`. When the clock source is APLL (only in DMA mode), it will be set to :cpp:enumerator:`esp_pm_lock_type_t::ESP_PM_NO_LIGHT_SLEEP`. Whenever the DAC is converting (i.e., DMA or cosine wave generator is working), the driver guarantees that the power management lock is acquired after calling :cpp:func:`dac_continuous_enable`. Likewise, the driver will release the lock when :cpp:func:`dac_continuous_disable` is called.\\n\\nIRAM Safe\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy default, the DAC DMA interrupt will be deferred when the cache is disabled for reasons like writing/erasing Flash. Thus the DMA EOF interrupt will not get executed in time.\\n\\nTo avoid such case in real-time applications, you can enable the Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_DAC_ISR_IRAM_SAFE` which:\\n\\n1. Enables the interrupt being serviced even when cache is disabled;\\n\\n2. Places driver object into DRAM (in case it is linked to PSRAM by accident).\\n\\nThis allows the interrupt to run while the cache is disabled but comes at the cost of increased IRAM consumption.\\n\\nThread Safety\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAll the public DAC APIs are guaranteed to be thread safe by the driver, which means users can call them from different RTOS tasks without protection by extra locks. Notice that the DAC driver uses mutex lock to ensure the thread safety, thus the APIs except :cpp:func:`dac_oneshot_output_voltage` are not allowed to be used in ISR.\\n\\nKconfig Options\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_DAC_ISR_IRAM_SAFE` controls whether the default ISR handler can work when cache is disabled. See `IRAM Safe <#iram-safe>`__ for more information.\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_DAC_SUPPRESS_DEPRECATE_WARN` controls whether to suppress the warning message compilation while using the legacy DAC driver.\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_DAC_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG` is used to enable the debug log output. Enable this option increases the firmware binary size.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    - :ref:`CONFIG_DAC_DMA_AUTO_16BIT_ALIGN` auto expands the 8-bit data to 16-bit data in the driver to satisfy the I2S DMA format.\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe basic examples for the ``One-shot Mode``, ``Continuous Mode``, and ``Cosine Mode`` can be found in:\\n\\n- :example:`peripherals/dac/dac_oneshot`\\n- :example:`peripherals/dac/dac_continuous`\\n- :example:`peripherals/dac/dac_cosine_wave`\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/dac_oneshot.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/dac_cosine.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/dac_continuous.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/components/esp_driver_dac/include/driver/dac_types.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/components/hal/include/hal/dac_types.inc\\n',\n",

Drivers can attach their devices to the bus with the arbitration of the lock.\\n\\nEach bus lock is initialized with a BG (background) service registered. All devices that request transactions on the bus should wait until the BG is successfully disabled.\\n\\n- For the SPI1 bus, the BG is the cache. The bus lock disables the cache before device operations start, and enables it again after the device releases the lock. No devices on SPI1 are allowed to use ISR, since it is meaningless for the task to yield to other tasks when the cache is disabled.\\n\\n  .. only:: esp32\\n\\n      There are quite a few limitations when using the SPI Master driver on the SPI1 bus. See :ref:`spi_master_on_spi1_bus`.\\n\\n  .. only:: not esp32\\n\\n      The SPI Master driver has not supported SPI1 bus. Only the SPI Flash driver can attach to the bus.\\n\\n- For other buses, the driver can register the ISR as a BG. If a device task requests exclusive bus access, the bus lock will block the task, disable the ISR, and then unblock the task. After the task releases the lock, the lock will try to re-enable the ISR if there are still pending transactions in the ISR.\\n',\n",

These peripherals can be configured to input and output sample data via the I2S driver.\\n\\nAn I2S bus that communicates in standard or TDM mode consists of the following lines:\\n\\n- **MCLK:** Master clock line. It is an optional signal depending on the slave side, mainly used for offering a reference clock to the I2S slave device.\\n- **BCLK:** Bit clock line. The bit clock for data line.\\n- **WS:** Word (Slot) select line. It is usually used to identify the vocal tract except PDM mode.\\n- **DIN/DOUT:** Serial data input/output line.

As RX and TX channels share a clock, they can only be combined with the same configuration to establish a full-duplex communication.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_I2S_HW_VERSION_2\\n\\n    Each controller has separate RX and TX channels. That means they are able to work under different clocks and slot configurations with separate GPIO pins. Note that although the internal MCLKs of TX channel and RX channel are separate on a controller, the output MCLK signal can only be attached to one channel. If independent MCLK output is required for each channel, they must be allocated on different I2S controllers.\\n\\nI2S File Structure\\n------------------\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/diagrams/i2s/i2s_file_structure.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: I2S file structure\\n\\n    I2S File Structure\\n\\n**Public headers that need to be included in the I2S application are as follows:**\\n\\n- ``i2s.h``: The header file that provides legacy I2S APIs (for apps using legacy driver).\\n- ``i2s_std.h``: The header file that provides standard communication mode specific APIs (for apps using new driver with standard mode).\\n- ``i2s_pdm.h``: The header file that provides PDM communication mode specific APIs (for apps using new driver with PDM mode).\\n- ``i2s_tdm.h``: The header file that provides TDM communication mode specific APIs (for apps using new driver with TDM mode).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The legacy driver cannot coexist with the new driver. Include ``i2s.h`` to use the legacy driver, or include the other three headers to use the new driver.

Its frequency is configurable according to the sample rate. However, if APLL has been occupied by EMAC or other channels, the APLL frequency cannot be changed, and the driver will try to work under this APLL frequency. If this frequency cannot meet the requirements of I2S, the clock configuration will fail.\\n\\nClock Terminology\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- **Sample rate**: The number of sampled data in one second per slot.\\n- **SCLK**: Source clock frequency. It is the frequency of the clock source.\\n- **MCLK**: Master clock frequency. BCLK is generated from this clock. The MCLK signal usually serves as a reference clock and is mostly needed to synchronize BCLK and WS between I2S master and slave roles.\\n- **BCLK**: Bit clock frequency. Every tick of this clock stands for one data bit on data pin. The slot bit width configured in :cpp:member:`i2s_std_slot_config_t::slot_bit_width` is equal to the number of BCLK ticks, which means there will be 8/16/24/32 BCLK ticks in one slot.\\n- **LRCK** / **WS**: Left/right clock or word select clock. For non-PDM mode, its frequency is equal to the sample rate.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Normally, MCLK should be the multiple of ``sample rate`` and BCLK at the same time. The field :cpp:member:`i2s_std_clk_config_t::mclk_multiple` indicates the multiple of MCLK to the ``sample rate``. In most cases, ``I2S_MCLK_MULTIPLE_256`` should be enough. However, if ``slot_bit_width`` is set to ``I2S_SLOT_BIT_WIDTH_24BIT``, to keep MCLK a multiple to the BCLK, :cpp:member:`i2s_std_clk_config_t::mclk_multiple` should be set to multiples that are divisible by 3 such as ``I2S_MCLK_MULTIPLE_384``. Otherwise, WS will be inaccurate.\\n\\n.. _i2s-communication-mode:\\n\\nI2S Communication Mode\\n----------------------\\n\\nOverview of All Modes\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n=========  ========  ========  ========  ========  ========  ==========\\n Target    Standard   PDM TX    PDM RX     TDM     ADC/DAC   LCD/Camera\\n=========  ========  ========  ========  ========  ========  ==========\\nESP32      I2S 0/1    I2S 0     I2S 0      none     I2S 0      I2S 0\\nESP32-S2    I2S 0     none      none       none     none       I2S 0\\nESP32-C3    I2S 0     I2S 0     none      I2S 0     none       none\\nESP32-C6    I2S 0     I2S 0     none      I2S 0     none       none\\nESP32-S3   I2S 0/1    I2S 0     I2S 0    I2S 0/1    none       none\\nESP32-H2    I2S 0     I2S 0     none      I2S 0     none       none\\nESP32-P4   I2S 0~2    I2S 0     I2S 0    I2S 0~2    none       none\\n=========  ========  ========  ========  ========  ========  ==========\\n\\nStandard Mode\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn standard mode, there are always two sound channels, i.e., the left and right channels, which are called \"slots\". These slots support 8/16/24/32-bit width sample data. The communication format for the slots mainly includes the followings:\\n\\n- **Philips Format**: Data signal has one-bit shift comparing to the WS signal, and the duty of WS signal is 50%.\\n\\n.. wavedrom:: /../_static/diagrams/i2s/std_philips.json\\n\\n- **MSB Format**: Basically the same as Philips format, but without data shift.\\n\\n.. wavedrom:: /../_static/diagrams/i2s/std_msb.json\\n\\n- **PCM Short Format**: Data has one-bit shift and meanwhile the WS signal becomes a pulse lasting for one BCLK cycle.\\n\\n.. wavedrom:: /../_static/diagrams/i2s/std_pcm.json\\n\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_I2S_SUPPORTS_PDM_TX\\n\\n    PDM Mode (TX)\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    PDM (Pulse-density Modulation) mode for the TX channel can convert PCM data into PDM format which always has left and right slots. PDM TX is only supported on I2S0 and it only supports 16-bit width sample data. It needs at least a CLK pin for clock signal and a DOUT pin for data signal (i.e., the WS and SD signal in the following figure; the BCK signal is an internal bit sampling clock, which is not needed between PDM devices). This mode allows users to configure the up-sampling parameters :cpp:member:`i2s_pdm_tx_clk_config_t::up_sample_fp` and :cpp:member:`i2s_pdm_tx_clk_config_t::up_sample_fs`. The up-sampling rate can be calculated by ``up_sample_rate = i2s_pdm_tx_clk_config_t::up_sample_fp / i2s_pdm_tx_clk_config_t::up_sample_fs``. There are two up-sampling modes in PDM TX:\\n\\n    - **Fixed Clock Frequency**: In this mode, the up-sampling rate changes according to the sample rate. Setting ``fp = 960`` and ``fs = sample_rate / 100``, then the clock frequency (Fpdm) on CLK pin will be fixed to ``128 * 48 KHz = 6.144 MHz``. Note that this frequency is not equal to the sample rate (Fpcm).\\n    - **Fixed Up-sampling Rate**: In this mode, the up-sampling rate is fixed to 2. Setting ``fp = 960`` and ``fs = 480``, then the clock frequency (Fpdm) on CLK pin will be ``128 * sample_rate``.\\n\\n    .. wavedrom:: /../_static/diagrams/i2s/pdm.json\\n\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_I2S_SUPPORTS_PDM_RX\\n\\n    PDM Mode (RX)\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    PDM (Pulse-density Modulation) mode for RX channel can receive PDM-format data and convert the data into PCM format. PDM RX is only supported on I2S0, and it only supports 16-bit width sample data. PDM RX needs at least a CLK pin for clock signal and a DIN pin for data signal. This mode allows users to configure the down-sampling parameter :cpp:member:`i2s_pdm_rx_clk_config_t::dn_sample_mode`. There are two down-sampling modes in PDM RX:\\n\\n    - :cpp:enumerator:`i2s_pdm_dsr_t::I2S_PDM_DSR_8S`: In this mode, the clock frequency (Fpdm) on the WS pin is ``sample_rate (Fpcm) * 64``.\\n    - :cpp:enumerator:`i2s_pdm_dsr_t::I2S_PDM_DSR_16S`: In this mode, the clock frequency (Fpdm) on the WS pin is ``sample_rate (Fpcm) * 128``.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_I2S_SUPPORTS_TDM\\n\\n    TDM Mode\\n    ^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    TDM (Time Division Multiplexing) mode supports up to 16 slots. These slots can be enabled by :cpp:member:`i2s_tdm_slot_config_t::slot_mask`.\\n\\n    .. only:: SOC_I2S_TDM_FULL_DATA_WIDTH\\n\\n        Any data bit-width is supported no matter how many slots are enabled, which means there can be up to ``32 bit-width * 16 slots = 512 bit`` data in one frame.\\n\\n    .. only:: not SOC_I2S_TDM_FULL_DATA_WIDTH\\n\\n        But due to the hardware limitation, only up to 4 slots are supported while the slot is set to 32 bit-width, and 8 slots for 16 bit-width, 16 slots for 8 bit-width. The slot communication format of TDM is almost the same as the standard mode, yet with some small differences.\\n\\n    - **Philips Format**: Data signal has one-bit shift comparing to the WS signal. And no matter how many slots are contained in one frame, the duty of WS signal always keeps 50%.\\n\\n    .. wavedrom:: /../_static/diagrams/i2s/tdm_philips.json\\n\\n    - **MSB Format**: Basically the same as the Philips format, but without data shift.\\n\\n    .. wavedrom:: /../_static/diagrams/i2s/tdm_msb.json\\n\\n    - **PCM Short Format**: Data has one-bit shift and the WS signal becomes a pulse lasting one BCLK cycle for every frame.\\n\\n    .. wavedrom:: /../_static/diagrams/i2s/tdm_pcm_short.json\\n\\n    - **PCM Long Format**: Data has one-bit shift and the WS signal lasts one-slot bit width for every frame. For example, the duty of WS will be 25% if there are four slots enabled, and 20% if there are five slots.\\n\\n    .. wavedrom:: /../_static/diagrams/i2s/tdm_pcm_long.json\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_I2S_SUPPORTS_LCD_CAMERA\\n\\n    LCD/Camera Mode\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    LCD/Camera mode is only supported on I2S0 over a parallel bus. For LCD mode, I2S0 should work at master TX mode. For camera mode, I2S0 should work at slave RX mode. These two modes are not implemented by the I2S driver. Please refer to :doc:`/api-reference/peripherals/lcd` for details about the LCD implementation. For more information, see **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **I2S Controller (I2S)** > LCD Mode [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#camlcdctrl>`__].\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_I2S_SUPPORTS_ADC_DAC\\n\\n    ADC/DAC Mode\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    ADC and DAC modes only exist on ESP32 and are only supported on I2S0. Actually, they are two sub-modes of LCD/Camera mode. I2S0 can be routed directly to the internal analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). In other words, ADC and DAC peripherals can read or write continuously via I2S0 DMA. As they are not actual communication modes, the I2S driver does not implement them.\\n\\nFunctional Overview\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe I2S driver offers the following services:\\n\\nResource Management\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThere are three levels of resources in the I2S driver:\\n\\n- ``platform level``: Resources of all I2S controllers in the current target.\\n- ``controller level``: Resources in one I2S controller.\\n- ``channel level``: Resources of TX or RX channel in one I2S controller.\\n\\nThe public APIs are all channel-level APIs. The channel handle :cpp:type:`i2s_chan_handle_t` can help users to manage the resources under a specific channel without considering the other two levels. The other two upper levels\\' resources are private and are managed by the driver automatically. Users can call :cpp:func:`i2s_new_channel` to allocate a channel handle and call :cpp:func:`i2s_del_channel` to delete it.\\n\\nPower Management\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen the power management is enabled (i.e., :ref:`CONFIG_PM_ENABLE` is on), the system will adjust or stop the source clock of I2S before entering Light-sleep, thus potentially changing the I2S signals and leading to transmitting or receiving invalid data.\\n\\nThe I2S driver can prevent the system from changing or stopping the source clock by acquiring a power management lock. When the source clock is generated from APB, the lock type will be set to :cpp:enumerator:`esp_pm_lock_type_t::ESP_PM_APB_FREQ_MAX` and when the source clock is APLL (if supported), it will be set to :cpp:enumerator:`esp_pm_lock_type_t::ESP_PM_NO_LIGHT_SLEEP`. Whenever the user is reading or writing via I2S (i.e., calling :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_read` or :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_write`), the driver guarantees that the power management lock is acquired. Likewise, the driver releases the lock after the reading or writing finishes.\\n\\nFinite State Machine\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThere are three states for an I2S channel, namely, ``registered``, ``ready``, and ``running``. Their relationship is shown in the following diagram:\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/diagrams/i2s/i2s_state_machine.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: I2S Finite State Machine\\n\\n    I2S Finite State Machine\\n\\nThe ``<mode>`` in the diagram can be replaced by corresponding I2S communication modes, e.g., ``std`` for standard two-slot mode. For more information about communication modes, please refer to the :ref:`i2s-communication-mode` section.\\n\\nData Transport\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe data transport of the I2S peripheral, including sending and receiving, is realized by DMA. Before transporting data, please call :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_enable` to enable the specific channel. When the sent or received data reaches the size of one DMA buffer, the ``I2S_OUT_EOF`` or ``I2S_IN_SUC_EOF`` interrupt will be triggered. Note that the DMA buffer size is not equal to :cpp:member:`i2s_chan_config_t::dma_frame_num`. One frame here refers to all the sampled data in one WS circle. Therefore, ``dma_buffer_size = dma_frame_num * slot_num * slot_bit_width / 8``. For the data transmitting, users can input the data by calling :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_write`. This function helps users to copy the data from the source buffer to the DMA TX buffer and wait for the transmission to finish. Then it will repeat until the sent bytes reach the given size. For the data receiving, the function :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_read` waits to receive the message queue which contains the DMA buffer address. It helps users copy the data from the DMA RX buffer to the destination buffer.\\n\\nBoth :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_write` and :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_read` are blocking functions. They keeps waiting until the whole source buffer is sent or the whole destination buffer is loaded, unless they exceed the max blocking time, where the error code ``ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT`` returns. To send or receive data asynchronously, callbacks can be registered by  :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_register_event_callback`. Users are able to access the DMA buffer directly in the callback function instead of transmitting or receiving by the two blocking functions. However, please be aware that it is an interrupt callback, so do not add complex logic, run floating operation, or call non-reentrant functions in the callback.\\n\\nConfiguration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nUsers can initialize a channel by calling corresponding functions (i.e., :func:`i2s_channel_init_std_mode`, :func:`i2s_channel_init_pdm_rx_mode`, :func:`i2s_channel_init_pdm_tx_mode`, or :func:`i2s_channel_init_tdm_mode`) to a specific mode. If the configurations need to be updated after initialization, users have to first call :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_disable` to ensure that the channel has stopped, and then call corresponding ``reconfig`` functions, like :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_reconfig_std_slot`, :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_reconfig_std_clock`, and :cpp:func:`i2s_channel_reconfig_std_gpio`.\\n\\nIRAM Safe\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy default, the I2S interrupt will be deferred when the cache is disabled for reasons like writing/erasing flash. Thus the EOF interrupt will not get executed in time.\\n\\nTo avoid such case in real-time applications, you can enable the Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_I2S_ISR_IRAM_SAFE` that:\\n\\n1. Keeps the interrupt being serviced even when the cache is disabled.\\n\\n2. Places driver object into DRAM (in case it is linked to PSRAM by accident).\\n\\nThis allows the interrupt to run while the cache is disabled, but comes at the cost of increased IRAM consumption.\\n\\nThread Safety\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAll the public I2S APIs are guaranteed to be thread safe by the driver, which means users can call them from different RTOS tasks without protection by extra locks. Notice that the I2S driver uses mutex lock to ensure the thread safety, thus these APIs are not allowed to be used in ISR.\\n\\nKconfig Options\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_I2S_ISR_IRAM_SAFE` controls whether the default ISR handler can work when the cache is disabled. See `IRAM Safe <#iram-safe>`__ for more information.\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_I2S_SUPPRESS_DEPRECATE_WARN` controls whether to suppress the compiling warning message while using the legacy I2S driver.\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_I2S_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG` is used to enable the debug log output.

Here are some simple usages of each mode:\\n\\nStandard TX/RX Usage\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nDifferent slot communication formats can be generated by the following helper macros for standard mode. As described above, there are three formats in standard mode, and their helper macros are:\\n\\n- :c:macro:`I2S_STD_PHILIPS_SLOT_DEFAULT_CONFIG`\\n- :c:macro:`I2S_STD_PCM_SLOT_DEFAULT_CONFIG`\\n- :c:macro:`I2S_STD_MSB_SLOT_DEFAULT_CONFIG`\\n\\nThe clock config helper macro is:\\n\\n- :c:macro:`I2S_STD_CLK_DEFAULT_CONFIG`\\n\\nPlease refer to :ref:`i2s-api-reference-i2s_std` for  information about STD API.

One-line codec is for the PDM codecs that require clock signal. The PDM codec can differentiate the left and right slots by the clock level. The other two modes are used to drive power amplifiers directly with a low-pass filter. They do not need the clock signal, so there are two lines to differentiate the left and right slots.

And for more details, please refer to :component_file:`esp_driver_i2s/include/driver/i2s_tdm.h`.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Due to hardware limitation, when setting the clock configuration for a slave role, please be aware that :cpp:member:`i2s_tdm_clk_config_t::bclk_div` should not be smaller than 8. Increasing this field can reduce the lagging of the data sent from the slave. In the high sample rate case, the data might lag behind for more than one BCLK which leads to data malposition. Users may gradually increase :cpp:member:`i2s_tdm_clk_config_t::bclk_div` to correct it.\\n\\n        As :cpp:member:`i2s_tdm_clk_config_t::bclk_div` is the division of MCLK to BCLK, increasing it also increases the MCLK frequency. Therefore, the clock calculation may fail if MCLK is too high to divide from the source clock.

Users can receive data lost event by registering the ISR callback function to receive the event queue:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        static IRAM_ATTR bool i2s_rx_queue_overflow_callback(i2s_chan_handle_t handle, i2s_event_data_t *event, void *user_ctx)\\n        {\\n            // handle RX queue overflow event ...\\n            return false;\\n        }\\n\\n        i2s_event_callbacks_t cbs = {\\n            .on_recv = NULL,\\n            .on_recv_q_ovf = i2s_rx_queue_overflow_callback,\\n            .on_sent = NULL,\\n            .on_send_q_ovf = NULL,\\n        };\\n        TEST_ESP_OK(i2s_channel_register_event_callback(rx_handle, &cbs, NULL));\\n\\nPlease follow these steps to prevent data lost:\\n\\n1. Determine the interrupt interval. Generally, when data lost happens, the bigger the interval, the better, which  helps to reduce the interrupt times. This means ``dma_frame_num`` should be as big as possible while the DMA buffer size is below the maximum value of 4092. The relationships are::\\n\\n    interrupt_interval(unit: sec) = dma_frame_num / sample_rate\\n    dma_buffer_size = dma_frame_num * slot_num * data_bit_width / 8 <= 4092\\n\\n2. Determine ``dma_desc_num``. ``dma_desc_num`` is decided by the maximum time of ``i2s_channel_read`` polling cycle. All the received data is supposed to be stored between two ``i2s_channel_read``. This cycle can be measured by a timer or an outputting GPIO signal. The relationship is::\\n\\n    dma_desc_num > polling_cycle / interrupt_interval\\n\\n3. Determine the receiving buffer size. The receiving buffer offered by users in ``i2s_channel_read`` should be able to take all the data in all DMA buffers, which means that it should be larger than the total size of all the DMA buffers::\\n\\n    recv_buffer_size > dma_desc_num * dma_buffer_size\\n\\nFor example, if there is an I2S application, and the known values are::\\n\\n    sample_rate = 144000 Hz\\n    data_bit_width = 32 bits\\n    slot_num = 2\\n    polling_cycle = 10 ms\\n\\nThen the parameters ``dma_frame_num``, ``dma_desc_num``, and ``recv_buf_size`` can be calculated as follows::\\n\\n    dma_frame_num * slot_num * data_bit_width / 8 = dma_buffer_size <= 4092\\n    dma_frame_num <= 511\\n    interrupt_interval = dma_frame_num / sample_rate = 511 / 144000 = 0.003549 s = 3.549 ms\\n    dma_desc_num > polling_cycle / interrupt_interval = cell(10 / 3.549) = cell(2.818) = 3\\n    recv_buffer_size > dma_desc_num * dma_buffer_size = 3 * 4092 = 12276 bytes\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. _i2s-api-reference-i2s_std:\\n\\nStandard Mode\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/i2s_std.inc\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_I2S_SUPPORTS_PDM\\n\\n    .. _i2s-api-reference-i2s_pdm:\\n\\n    PDM Mode\\n    ^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    .. include-build-file:: inc/i2s_pdm.inc\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_I2S_SUPPORTS_TDM\\n\\n    .. _i2s-api-reference-i2s_tdm:\\n\\n    TDM Mode\\n    ^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    .. include-build-file:: inc/i2s_tdm.inc\\n\\n.. _i2s-api-reference-i2s_driver:\\n\\nI2S Driver\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/i2s_common.inc\\n\\n.. _i2s-api-reference-i2s_types:\\n\\nI2S Types\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/components/esp_driver_i2s/include/driver/i2s_types.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/components/hal/include/hal/i2s_types.inc\\n',\n",

Its structure is :cpp:type:`adc_digi_output_data_t`, including ADC unit, ADC channel, and raw data.\\n\\n.. image:: /../_static/diagrams/adc/adc_conversion_frame.png\\n    :scale: 100 %\\n    :align: center\\n\\nFunctional Overview\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe following sections of this document cover the typical steps to install the ADC continuous mode driver, and read ADC conversion results from a group of ADC channels continuously:\\n\\n- :ref:`adc-continuous-resource-allocation`: covers which parameters should be set up to initialize the ADC continuous mode driver and how to deinitialize it.\\n- :ref:`adc-continuous-adc-configurations`: describes how to configure the ADC(s) to make it work under continuous mode.\\n- :ref:`adc-continuous-adc-control`: describes ADC control functions.\\n- :ref:`adc-continuous-register-event-callbacks`: describes how to hook user-specific code to an ADC continuous mode event callback function.\\n- :ref:`adc-continuous-read-conversion-result`: covers how to get ADC conversion result.\\n- :ref:`adc-continuous-hardware-limitations`: describes the ADC-related hardware limitations.\\n- :ref:`adc-continuous-power-management`: covers power management-related information.\\n- :ref:`adc-continuous-iram-safe`: covers the IRAM safe functions.\\n- :ref:`adc-continuous-thread-safety`: lists which APIs are guaranteed to be thread-safe by the driver.\\n\\n\\n.. _adc-continuous-resource-allocation:\\n\\nResource Allocation\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe ADC continuous mode driver is implemented based on {IDF_TARGET_NAME} SAR ADC module. Different ESP targets might have different numbers of independent ADCs.\\n\\nTo create an ADC continuous mode driver handle, set up the required configuration structure :cpp:type:`adc_continuous_handle_cfg_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`adc_continuous_handle_cfg_t::max_store_buf_size`: set the maximum size of the pool in bytes, and the driver saves ADC conversion result into the pool. If this pool is full, new conversion results will be lost.\\n- :cpp:member:`adc_continuous_handle_cfg_t::conv_frame_size`: set the size of the ADC conversion frame, in bytes.\\n- :cpp:member:`adc_continuous_handle_cfg_t::flags`: set the flags that can change the driver\\'s behavior.\\n\\n  - ``flush_pool``: auto flush the pool when it\\'s full.\\n\\n\\nAfter setting up the above configurations for the ADC, call :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_new_handle` with the prepared :cpp:type:`adc_continuous_handle_cfg_t`. This function may fail due to various errors such as invalid arguments, insufficient memory, etc.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    Especially, when this function returns :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND`, this means the I2S0 peripheral is in use. See :ref:`adc-continuous-hardware-limitations` for more information.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s2\\n\\n    Especially, when this function returns :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND`, this means the SPI3 peripheral is in use. See :ref:`adc-continuous-hardware-limitations` for more information.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_GDMA_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Especially, when this function returns :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND`, this means there is no free GDMA channel.\\n\\nIf the ADC continuous mode driver is no longer used, you should deinitialize the driver by calling :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_deinit`.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_ADC_DIG_IIR_FILTER_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    IIR filter\\n    ~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n    Two IIR filters are available when ADC is working in continuous mode. To create an ADC IIR filter, you should set up :cpp:type:`adc_continuous_iir_filter_config_t` and call :cpp:func:`adc_new_continuous_iir_filter`.\\n\\n    - :cpp:member:`adc_digi_filter_config_t::unit`: ADC unit.\\n    - :cpp:member:`adc_digi_filter_config_t::channel`: ADC channel to be filtered.\\n    - :cpp:member:`adc_digi_filter_config_t::coeff`: Filter coefficient.\\n\\n    .. only:: SOC_ADC_DIG_IIR_FILTER_UNIT_BINDED\\n\\n            On {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, the filter is per ADC unit. Once a filter is enabled, all the enabled ADC channels in this ADC unit will be filtered. However, we suggest only enabling one ADC channel per unit, when using the filter feature. Because the filtered results depend on the previous filtered result. So you should not enable multiple ADC channels, to avoid mixing the filtered results.\\n\\n    To recycle a filter, you should call :cpp:func:`adc_del_continuous_iir_filter`.\\n\\n    .. only:: not SOC_ADC_DIG_IIR_FILTER_UNIT_BINDED\\n\\n        .. note::\\n\\n            If you use both filters on the same ADC channel, then only the first one will take effect.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_ADC_MONITOR_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Monitor\\n    ~~~~~~~\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_SOC_ADC_DIGI_MONITOR_NUM} monitors are available when ADC is working under continuous mode, you can set one or two threshold(s) of a monitor on a working ADC channel, then the monitor will invoke interrupts every sample loop if conversion result outranges of the threshold. To create an ADC monitor, you need to set up the :cpp:type:`adc_monitor_config_t` and call :cpp:func:`adc_new_continuous_monitor`.\\n\\n    - :cpp:member:`adc_monitor_config_t::adc_unit`: Configures which ADC unit the channel you want to monitor belongs to.\\n    - :cpp:member:`adc_monitor_config_t::channel`: The channel you want to monitor.\\n    - :cpp:member:`adc_monitor_config_t::h_threshold`: The high threshold, conversion result larger than this value invokes interrupt, set to -1 if do not use.\\n    - :cpp:member:`adc_monitor_config_t::l_threshold`: The low threshold, conversion result less than this value invokes interrupt, set to -1 if do not use.\\n\\n    Once a monitor is created, you can operate it by following APIs to construct your apps.\\n\\n    - :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_monitor_enable`: Enable a monitor.\\n    - :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_monitor_disable`: Disable a monitor.\\n    - :cpp:func:`adc_monitor_register_callbacks`: register user callbacks to take action when the ADC value exceeds of the threshold.\\n    - :cpp:func:`adc_del_continuous_monitor`: Delete a created monitor and free resources.\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32s2\\n\\n        .. NOTE::\\n\\n            There are some hardware limitations on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}:\\n            1. Only one threshold is supported for one monitor.\\n            2. Only one monitor is supported for one ADC unit.\\n            3. All enabled channel(s) of a certain ADC unit in ADC continuous mode driver will be monitored.

Refer to the On-Chip Sensor and Analog Signal Processing chapter in `TRM <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}>`__.\\n- :cpp:member:`adc_digi_pattern_config_t::channel`: the IO corresponding ADC channel number. See the note below.\\n- :cpp:member:`adc_digi_pattern_config_t::unit`: the ADC that the IO is subordinate to.\\n- :cpp:member:`adc_digi_pattern_config_t::bit_width`: the bitwidth of the raw conversion result.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    For the IO corresponding ADC channel number, check `TRM <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#sensor>`__ to acquire the ADC IOs. Besides, :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_io_to_channel` and :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_channel_to_io` can be used to acquire the ADC channels and ADC IOs.\\n\\nTo make these settings take effect, call :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_config` with the configuration structure above. This API may fail due to reasons like :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG`. When it returns :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE`, this means the ADC continuous mode driver is started, you should not call this API at this moment.\\n\\nSee ADC continuous mode example :example:`peripherals/adc/continuous_read` to see configuration codes.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_ADC_DIG_IIR_FILTER_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    To enable/disable the ADC IIR filter, you should call :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_iir_filter_enable` / :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_iir_filter_disable`.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_ADC_MONITOR_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    To enable/disable the ADC monitor, you should call :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_monitor_enable` / :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_monitor_disable`.\\n\\n.. _adc-continuous-adc-control:\\n\\nADC Control\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nStart and Stop\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nCalling :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_start` makes the ADC start to measure analog signals from the configured ADC channels, and generate the conversion results.\\n\\nOn the contrary, calling :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_stop` stops the ADC conversion.\\n\\n.. code::c\\n\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(adc_continuous_start());\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(adc_continuous_stop());\\n\\n\\n.. _adc-continuous-register-event-callbacks:\\n\\nRegister Event Callbacks\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy calling :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_register_event_callbacks`, you can hook your own function to the driver ISR. Supported event callbacks are listed in :cpp:type:`adc_continuous_evt_cbs_t`.\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`adc_continuous_evt_cbs_t::on_conv_done`: this is invoked when one conversion frame finishes.\\n- :cpp:member:`adc_continuous_evt_cbs_t::on_pool_ovf`: this is invoked when the internal pool is full. Newer conversion results will be discarded.\\n\\nAs the above callbacks are called in an ISR context, you should always ensure the callback function is suitable for an ISR context. Blocking logic should not appear in these callbacks. The callback function prototype is declared in :cpp:type:`adc_continuous_callback_t`.\\n\\nYou can also register your own context when calling :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_register_event_callbacks` by the parameter ``user_data``. This user data will be passed to the callback functions directly.\\n\\nThis function may fail due to reasons like :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG`. Especially, when :ref:`CONFIG_ADC_CONTINUOUS_ISR_IRAM_SAFE` is enabled, this error may indicate that the callback functions are not in the internal RAM. Check the error log for more details. Besides, when it fails due to :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE`, it indicates that the ADC continuous mode driver is started, and you should not add a callback at this moment.\\n\\n\\nConversion Done Event\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nWhen the driver completes a conversion, it triggers the :cpp:member:`adc_continuous_evt_cbs_t::on_conv_done` event and fills the event data. Event data contains a buffer pointer to a conversion frame buffer, together with the size. Refer to :cpp:type:`adc_continuous_evt_data_t` to know the event data structure.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    It is worth noting that, the data buffer :cpp:member:`adc_continuous_evt_data_t::conv_frame_buffer` is maintained by the driver itself. Therefore, never free this piece of memory.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    When the Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_ADC_CONTINUOUS_ISR_IRAM_SAFE` is enabled, the registered callbacks and the functions called by the callbacks should be placed in IRAM. The involved variables should be placed in internal RAM as well.\\n\\nPool Overflow Event\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe ADC continuous mode driver has an internal pool to save the conversion results. When the pool is full, a pool overflow event will emerge. Under this condition, the driver will not fill in the event data. This usually happens because the speed to read data from the pool by calling :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_read` is much slower than the ADC conversion speed.\\n\\n\\n.. _adc-continuous-read-conversion-result:\\n\\nRead Conversion Result\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAfter calling :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_start`, the ADC continuous conversion starts. Call :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_read` to get the conversion results of the ADC channels. You need to provide a buffer to get the raw results.\\n\\nFunction :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_read` tries to read the expected length of conversion results each time.\\n\\n- When calling :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_read`, you can request to read a conversion result of the specified length. Sometimes, however, the actual available conversion results may be less than the requested length, in which case the function still moves the data from the internal pool into the buffer you provided. Therefore, to learn the number of conversion results actually moved into the buffer, please check the value of ``out_length``.\\n- If there is no conversion result generated in the internal pool, the function will block for ``timeout_ms`` until the conversion results are generated. If there are still no generated results, the function will return :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT`.\\n- If the generated results fill up the internal pool, newly generated results will be lost. Next time when :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_read` is called, this function will return :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_INVALID_STATE` to indicate this situation.\\n\\nThis API aims to give you a chance to read all the ADC continuous conversion results.\\n\\nThe ADC conversion results read from the above function are raw data. To calculate the voltage based on the ADC raw results, this formula can be used:\\n\\n.. parsed-literal::\\n\\n    Vout = Dout * Vmax / Dmax       (1)\\n\\nwhere:\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n    :widths: 20 80\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    * - Vout\\n      - Digital output result, standing for the voltage.\\n    * - Dout\\n      - ADC raw digital reading result.\\n    * - Vmax\\n      - Maximum measurable input analog voltage, this is related to the ADC attenuation, please refer to the On-Chip Sensor and Analog Signal Processing chapter in `TRM <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}>`__.\\n    * - Dmax\\n      - Maximum of the output ADC raw digital reading result, which is 2^bitwidth, where the bitwidth is the :cpp:member:`adc_digi_pattern_config_t::bit_width` configured before.\\n\\nTo do further calibration to convert the ADC raw result to voltage in mV, please refer to :doc:`adc_calibration`.\\n\\n.. _adc-continuous-hardware-limitations:\\n\\n.. _hardware_limitations_adc_continuous:\\n\\nHardware Limitations\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- A specific ADC unit can only work under one operating mode at any one time, either continuous mode or one-shot mode. :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_start` has provided the protection.\\n\\n- Random Number Generator (RNG) uses ADC as an input source. When ADC continuous mode driver works, the random number generated from RNG will be less random.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32s2\\n\\n    - ADC2 is also used by Wi-Fi. :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_start` has provided the protection between Wi-Fi driver and ADC continuous mode driver.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    - ADC continuous mode driver uses I2S0 peripheral as hardware DMA FIFO.

The lock is acquired after the continuous conversion is started by :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_start`. Similarly, the lock will be released after :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_stop`. Therefore, :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_start` and :cpp:func:`adc_continuous_stop` should appear in pairs, otherwise, the power management will be out of action.\\n\\n\\n.. _adc-continuous-iram-safe:\\n\\nIRAM Safe\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAll the ADC continuous mode driver APIs are not IRAM-safe. They are not supposed to be run when the Cache is disabled.

       " 'USB Host\\n========\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThe document provides information regarding the USB Host Library. This document is split into the following sections:\\n\\n.. contents:: Sections\\n  :depth: 2\\n\\n.. ---------------------------------------------------- Overview -------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nThe USB Host Library (hereinafter referred to as the Host Library) is the lowest layer of the USB Host stack that exposes a public facing API. In most cases, applications that require USB Host functionality do not need to interface with the Host Library directly. Instead, most applications use the API provided by a host class driver that is implemented on top of the Host Library.\\n\\nHowever, you may want to use the Host Library directly for some of (but not limited to) the following reasons:\\n\\n- Implementation of a custom host class driver\\n- Usage of lower level USB Host API\\n\\nFeatures & Limitations\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe Host Library has the following features:\\n\\n- Supports Full Speed (FS) and Low Speed (LS) Devices.\\n- Supports all four transfer types, i.e., Control, Bulk, Interrupt, and Isochronous.\\n- Allows multiple class drivers to run simultaneously, i.e., multiple clients of the Host Library.\\n- A single device can be used by multiple clients simultaneously, e.g., composite devices.\\n- The Host Library itself and the underlying Host Stack does not internally instantiate any OS tasks. The number of tasks is entirely controlled by how the Host Library interface is used. However, a general rule of thumb regarding the number of tasks is ``(the number of host class drivers running + 1)``.\\n\\nCurrently, the Host Library and the underlying Host Stack has the following limitations:\\n\\n- Only supports a single device, but the Host Library\\'s API is designed for multiple device support.\\n- Only supports Asynchronous transfers.\\n- Only supports using the first configuration found. Changing to other configurations is not supported yet.\\n- Transfer timeouts are not supported yet.\\n\\n\\n.. -------------------------------------------------- Architecture -----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nArchitecture\\n------------\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/usb_host_lib_entities.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of the Key Entities of USB Host Functionality\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Diagram of the key entities involved in USB Host functionality\\n\\nThe diagram above shows the key entities that are involved when implementing USB Host functionality. These entities are:\\n\\n- The **Host Library**\\n- **Clients** of the Host Library\\n- **Devices**\\n- Host Library **Daemon Task**\\n\\nHost Library\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe Host Library is the lowest public-facing API layer of the ESP-IDF USB Host Stack. Any other ESP-IDF component (such as a class driver or a user component) that needs to communicate with a connected USB device can only do so using the Host Library API either directly or indirectly.\\n\\nThe Host Library\\'s API is split into two sub-sets, namely the **Library API** and **Client API**.\\n\\n- The Client API handles the communication between a client of the Host Library and one or more USB devices. The Client API should only be called by registered clients of the Host Library.\\n- The Library API handles all of the Host Library processing that is not specific to a single client, such as device enumeration. Usually, the library API is called by a Host Library Daemon Task.\\n\\nClients\\n^^^^^^^\\n\\nA client of the Host Library is a software component, such as a host class driver or user component, which utilizes the Host Library to establish communication with a USB device. Generally, each client has a one-to-one relation with a task. This implies that all Client API calls pertaining to a specific client must originate from the context of the same task.\\n\\nBy organizing the software components that use the Host Library\\'s into clients, the Host Library can delegate the handling of all events specific to that client to the client\\'s task. In other words, each client task is responsible for all the required processing and event handling associated with the USB communication that the client initiates.\\n\\nDaemon Task\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAlthough the Host Library delegates the handling of client events to the clients themselves, there are still Library events – events that are not specific to any particular client – that need to be handled. Library event handling can include things such as:\\n\\n- Handling USB device connection, enumeration, and disconnection\\n- Rerouting control transfers to/from clients\\n- Forwarding events to clients\\n\\nTherefore, in addition to the client tasks, the Host Library also requires a task, which is usually the Host Library Daemon Task, to handle all of the library events.\\n\\nDevices\\n^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe Host Library shields clients from the details of device handling, encompassing details such as connection, memory allocation, and enumeration. The clients are provided only with a list of already connected and enumerated devices to choose from. During enumeration, each device is automatically configured to use the first configuration found, namely, the first configuration descriptor returned on a Get Configuration Descriptor request. For most standard devices, the first configuration will have a ``bConfigurationValue`` of ``1``.\\n\\nIt is possible for two or more clients to simultaneously communicate with the same device as long as they are not communicating to the same interface. However, multiple clients can simultaneously communicate with the same device\\'s default endpoint (i.e., EP0), which will result in their control transfers being serialized.\\n\\nFor a client to communicate with a device, the client must:\\n\\n#. Open the device using the device\\'s address. This lets the Host Library know that the client is using that device.\\n#. Claim the interface(s) that will be used for communication. This prevents other clients from claiming the same interface(s).\\n#. Send transfers to the endpoints of claimed interfaces. The client\\'s task is responsible for handling its own processing and events related to USB device communication.\\n\\n\\n.. ------------------------------------------------------ Usage --------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\nThe Host Library and the underlying Host Stack will not create any tasks. All tasks, namely the client tasks and the Daemon Task, need to be created by the class drivers or the user. Instead, the Host Library provides two event handler functions that handle all of the required Host Library processing, thus these functions should be called repeatedly from the client tasks and the Daemon Task. Therefore, the implementation of client tasks and the Daemon Task will be largely centered around the invocation of these event handler functions.\\n\\nHost Library & Daemon Task\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBasic Usage\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nThe Host Library API provides :cpp:func:`usb_host_lib_handle_events` to handle library events. This function should be called repeatedly, typically from the Daemon Task. Some notable features regarding :cpp:func:`usb_host_lib_handle_events` are:\\n\\n- The function can block until a library event needs handling.\\n- Event flags are returned on each invocation. These event flags are useful for knowing when the Host Library can be uninstalled.\\n\\nA bare-bones Daemon Task would resemble something like the following code snippet:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    #include \"usb/usb_host.h\"\\n\\n    void daemon_task(void *arg)\\n    {\\n        ...\\n        bool exit = false;\\n        while (!exit) {\\n            uint32_t event_flags;\\n            usb_host_lib_handle_events(portMAX_DELAY, &event_flags);\\n            if (event_flags & USB_HOST_LIB_EVENT_FLAGS_NO_CLIENTS) {\\n                ...\\n            }\\n            if (event_flags & USB_HOST_LIB_EVENT_FLAGS_ALL_FREE) {\\n                ...\\n            }\\n            ...\\n        }\\n        ...\\n    }\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    See the :example:`peripherals/usb/host/usb_host_lib` example for full implementation of the Daemon Task.\\n\\nLifecycle\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/usb_host_lib_lifecycle.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Graph of Typical USB Host Library Lifecycle\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Graph of Typical USB Host Library Lifecycle\\n\\nThe graph above illustrates the typical lifecycle of the Host Library with multiple clients and devices. Specifically, the example involves:\\n\\n- two registered clients (Client 1 and Client 2).\\n- two connected devices (Device 1 and Device 2), where Client 1 communicates with Device 1 and Client 2 communicates with Device 2.\\n\\nWith reference to the graph above, the typical lifecycle involves the following key stages.\\n\\n1. The Host Library is installed by calling :cpp:func:`usb_host_install`.\\n    - Installation must be done before any other Host Library API is called.\\n    - Where :cpp:func:`usb_host_install` is called (e.g., from the Daemon Task or another task) depends on the synchronization logic between the Daemon Task, client tasks, and the rest of the system.\\n2. Once the Host Library is installed, the clients can be registered by calling :cpp:func:`usb_host_client_register`.\\n    - This is typically called from the client task, where the client task waits for a signal from the Daemon Task.\\n    - This can be called elsewhere if necessary as long it is called after :cpp:func:`usb_host_install`.\\n3. Device 1 connects and is then enumerated.\\n    - Each registered client (in this case Client 1 and Client 2) is notified of the new device by way of the :cpp:enumerator:`USB_HOST_CLIENT_EVENT_NEW_DEV` event.\\n    - Client 1 opens Device 1 and begins communication with it.\\n4. Similarly Device 2 connects and is enumerated.\\n    - Client 1 and 2 are notified of a new device via a :cpp:enumerator:`USB_HOST_CLIENT_EVENT_NEW_DEV` event.\\n    - Client 2 opens Device 2 and begins communication with it.\\n5. Device 1 suddenly disconnects.\\n    - Client 1 is notified by way of :cpp:enumerator:`USB_HOST_CLIENT_EVENT_DEV_GONE` and begins its cleanup.\\n    - Client 2 is not notified as it has not opened Device 1.\\n6. Client 1 completes its cleanup and deregisters by calling :cpp:func:`usb_host_client_deregister`.\\n    - This is typically called from the client task before the task exits.\\n    - This can be called elsewhere if necessary as long as Client 1 has already completed its cleanup.\\n7. Client 2 completes its communication with Device 2. Client 2 then closes Device 2 and deregisters itself.\\n    - The Daemon Task is notified of the deregistration of all clients by way the :c:macro:`USB_HOST_LIB_EVENT_FLAGS_NO_CLIENTS` event flag as Client 2 is the last client to deregister.\\n    - Device 2 is still allocated (i.e., not freed), as it is still connected albeit not currently opened by any client.\\n8. The Daemon Task decides to clean up as there are no more clients.\\n    - The Daemon Task must free Device 2 first by calling :cpp:func:`usb_host_device_free_all`.\\n    - If :cpp:func:`usb_host_device_free_all` was able to free all devices, the function will return `ESP_OK` indicating that all devices have been freed.\\n    - If :cpp:func:`usb_host_device_free_all` was unable to free all devices for reasons like the device is still opened by a client, the function will return `ESP_ERR_NOT_FINISHED`.\\n    - The Daemon Task must wait for :cpp:func:`usb_host_lib_handle_events` to return the :c:macro:`USB_HOST_LIB_EVENT_FLAGS_ALL_FREE` event flag in order to know when all devices have been freed.\\n9. Once the Daemon Task has verified that all clients have deregistered and all devices have been freed, it can now uninstall the Host Library by calling :cpp:func:`usb_host_uninstall`.\\n\\nClients & Class Driver\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBasic Usage\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nThe Host Library API provides :cpp:func:`usb_host_client_handle_events` to handle a particular client\\'s events. This function should be called repeatedly, typically from the client\\'s task. Some notable features regarding :cpp:func:`usb_host_client_handle_events` are:\\n\\n- The function can block until a client event needs handling.\\n- The function\\'s primary purpose is to call the various event handling callbacks when a client event occurs.\\n\\nThe following callbacks are called from within :cpp:func:`usb_host_client_handle_events` thus allowing the client task to be notified of events.\\n\\n- The client event callback of type :cpp:type:`usb_host_client_event_cb_t` delivers client event messages to the client. Client event messages indicate events such as the addition or removal of a device.\\n- The USB transfer completion callback of type :cpp:type:`usb_transfer_cb_t` indicates that a particular USB transfer previously submitted by the client has been completed.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Given that the callbacks are called from within :cpp:func:`usb_host_client_handle_events`, users should avoid blocking from within the callbacks as this will result in :cpp:func:`usb_host_client_handle_events` being blocked as well, thus preventing other pending client events from being handled.\\n\\nThe following code snippet demonstrates a bare-bones host class driver and its client task. The code snippet contains:\\n\\n- A simple client task function ``client_task`` that calls :cpp:func:`usb_host_client_handle_events` in a loop.\\n- Implementations of a client event callback and transfer completion callbacks.\\n- Implementation of a simple state machine for the class driver. The class driver simply opens a device, sends an OUT transfer to EP1, then closes the device.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    #include <string.h>\\n    #include \"usb/usb_host.h\"\\n\\n    #define CLASS_DRIVER_ACTION_OPEN_DEV    0x01\\n    #define CLASS_DRIVER_ACTION_TRANSFER    0x02\\n    #define CLASS_DRIVER_ACTION_CLOSE_DEV   0x03\\n\\n    struct class_driver_control {\\n        uint32_t actions;\\n        uint8_t dev_addr;\\n        usb_host_client_handle_t client_hdl;\\n        usb_device_handle_t dev_hdl;\\n    };\\n\\n    static void client_event_cb(const usb_host_client_event_msg_t *event_msg, void *arg)\\n    {\\n        // This function is called from within usb_host_client_handle_events().

Signal the Daemon Task if necessary.\\n    }\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    An actual host class driver is likely to support many more features, thus will have a much more complex state machine. A host class driver is also likely to need to:\\n\\n    - Be able to open multiple devices\\n    - Parse an opened device\\'s descriptors to identify if the device is of the target class\\n    - Communicate with multiple endpoints of an interface in a particular order\\n    - Claim multiple interfaces of a device\\n    - Handle various errors\\n\\nLifecycle\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nThe typical life cycle of a client task and class driver will go through the following stages:\\n\\n#. Wait for some signal regarding the Host Library being installed.\\n#. Register the client via :cpp:func:`usb_host_client_register` and allocate any other class driver resources, such as allocating transfers using :cpp:func:`usb_host_transfer_alloc`.\\n#. For each new device that the class driver needs to communicate with:\\n\\n    a. Check if the device is already connected via :cpp:func:`usb_host_device_addr_list_fill`.\\n    b. If the device is not already connected, wait for a :cpp:enumerator:`USB_HOST_CLIENT_EVENT_NEW_DEV` event from the client event callback.\\n    c. Open the device via :cpp:func:`usb_host_device_open`.\\n    d. Parse the device and configuration descriptors via :cpp:func:`usb_host_get_device_descriptor` and :cpp:func:`usb_host_get_active_config_descriptor` respectively.\\n    e. Claim the necessary interfaces of the device via :cpp:func:`usb_host_interface_claim`.\\n\\n#. Submit transfers to the device via :cpp:func:`usb_host_transfer_submit` or :cpp:func:`usb_host_transfer_submit_control`.\\n#. Once an opened device is no longer needed by the class driver, or has disconnected, as indicated by a :cpp:enumerator:`USB_HOST_CLIENT_EVENT_DEV_GONE` event:\\n\\n    a. Stop any previously submitted transfers to the device\\'s endpoints by calling :cpp:func:`usb_host_endpoint_halt` and :cpp:func:`usb_host_endpoint_flush` on those endpoints.\\n    b. Release all previously claimed interfaces via :cpp:func:`usb_host_interface_release`.\\n    c. Close the device via :cpp:func:`usb_host_device_close`.\\n\\n#. Deregister the client via :cpp:func:`usb_host_client_deregister` and free any other class driver resources.\\n#. Delete the client task.

the USB system software is expected to provide a \"recovery\" interval of 10 ms before the device attached to the port is expected to respond to data transfers.\\n* After the reset/resume recovery interval, if a device receives a ``SetAddress()`` request, the device must be able to complete processing of the request and be able to successfully complete the Status stage of the request within 50 ms.\\n* After successful completion of the Status stage, the device is allowed a ``SetAddress()`` recovery interval of 2 ms.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    For more details regarding connection event

Consequently, the user is provided with the obtained device descriptor. Through this callback, the user can:\\n\\n* Select the configuration of the USB device.\\n* Filter which USB devices should be enumerated.\\n\\nTo use the enumeration filter, users should enable the :ref:`CONFIG_USB_HOST_ENABLE_ENUM_FILTER_CALLBACK` option using menuconfig.

It uses ``HS1_*`` signals in the PIN MUX.\\n    - Slot 1 (:c:macro:`SDMMC_HOST_SLOT_1`) is a 4-bit slot. It uses ``HS2_*`` signals in the PIN MUX.\\n\\n    The slots are connected to {IDF_TARGET_NAME} GPIOs using IO MUX. Pin mappings of these slots are given in the table below.\\n\\n    .. list-table::\\n        :header-rows: 1\\n        :widths: 20 40 40\\n        :align: center\\n\\n        * - Signal\\n          - Slot 0\\n          - Slot 1\\n        * - CMD\\n          - GPIO11\\n          - GPIO15\\n        * - CLK\\n          - GPIO6\\n          - GPIO14\\n        * - D0\\n          - GPIO7\\n          - GPIO2\\n        * - D1\\n          - GPIO8\\n          - GPIO4\\n        * - D2\\n          - GPIO9\\n          - GPIO12\\n        * - D3\\n          - GPIO10\\n          - GPIO13\\n        * - D4\\n          - GPIO16\\n          -\\n        * - D5\\n          - GPIO17\\n          -\\n        * - D6\\n          - GPIO5\\n          -\\n        * - D7\\n          - GPIO18\\n          -\\n        * - CD\\n          - any input via GPIO matrix\\n          - any input via GPIO matrix\\n        * - WP\\n          - any input via GPIO matrix\\n          - any input via GPIO matrix\\n\\n    The Card Detect (CD) and Write Protect (WP) signals can be routed to arbitrary pins using the GPIO matrix. To reserve the pins, set the ``cd`` and ``wp`` members of the :cpp:class:`sdmmc_slot_config_t` structure before calling :cpp:func:`sdmmc_host_init_slot`. Please note that it is not advised to specify a CD pin when working with SDIO cards, because the CD signal in ESP32 can also trigger SDIO slave interrupt.\\n\\n    .. warning::\\n\\n        Pins used by Slot 0 (``HS1_*``) are also used to connect the SPI flash chip in ESP32-WROOM and ESP32-WROVER modules. These pins cannot be concurrently shared between an SD card and an SPI flash. If you need to use Slot 0, establish an alternative connection for the SPI flash using different pins and configure the necessary eFuses accordingly.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s3\\n\\n    Both slots :c:macro:`SDMMC_HOST_SLOT_0` and :c:macro:`SDMMC_HOST_SLOT_1` support 1-, 4- and 8-line SD interfaces.

This means that any GPIO may be used for each of the SD card signals.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32p4\\n\\n    - :c:macro:`SDMMC_HOST_SLOT_1` is routed via GPIO Matrix. This means that any GPIO may be used for each of the SD card signals. It is for non UHS-I usage.\\n    - :c:macro:`SDMMC_HOST_SLOT_0` is dedicated to UHS-I mode, which is not yet supported in the driver.\\n\\n    Currently SDMMC host driver is using the on-chip LDO 4 as the default power supply. SDMMC power control driver is not supported yet. If you buy the ESP32P4 chip itself and plan to use SDMMC peripheral, make sure the VDDPST_5 pin is connected to the on-chip LDO 4 or correct external power supply.\\n\\nSupported Speed Modes\\n---------------------\\n\\nSDMMC Host driver supports the following speed modes:\\n\\n- Default Speed (20 MHz): 1-line or 4-line with SD cards, and 1-line, 4-line, or 8-line with 3.3 V eMMC\\n- High Speed (40 MHz): 1-line or 4-line with SD cards, and 1-line, 4-line, or 8-line with 3.3 V eMMC\\n- High Speed DDR (40 MHz): 4-line with 3.3 V eMMC\\n\\nSpeed modes not supported at present:\\n\\n- High Speed DDR mode: 8-line eMMC\\n- UHS-I 1.8 V modes: 4-line SD cards\\n\\n\\nUsing the SDMMC Host Driver\\n---------------------------\\n\\nOf all the functions listed below, only the following ones will be used directly by most applications:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`sdmmc_host_init`\\n- :cpp:func:`sdmmc_host_init_slot`\\n- :cpp:func:`sdmmc_host_deinit`\\n\\nOther functions, such as the ones given below, will be called by the SD/MMC protocol layer via function pointers in the :cpp:class:`sdmmc_host_t` structure:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`sdmmc_host_set_bus_width`\\n- :cpp:func:`sdmmc_host_set_card_clk`\\n- :cpp:func:`sdmmc_host_do_transaction`\\n\\n\\nConfiguring Bus Width and Frequency\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nWith the default initializers for :cpp:class:`sdmmc_host_t` and :cpp:class:`sdmmc_slot_config_t`, i.e., :c:macro:`SDMMC_HOST_DEFAULT` and :c:macro:`SDMMC_SLOT_CONFIG_DEFAULT`, SDMMC Host driver will attempt to use the widest bus supported by the card (4 lines for SD, 8 lines for eMMC) and the frequency of 20 MHz.\\n\\nIn the designs where communication at 40 MHz frequency can be achieved, it is possible to increase the bus frequency by changing the ``max_freq_khz`` field of :cpp:class:`sdmmc_host_t`:\\n\\n.. code-block::\\n\\n    sdmmc_host_t host = SDMMC_HOST_DEFAULT();\\n    host.max_freq_khz = SDMMC_FREQ_HIGHSPEED;\\n\\nIf you need a specific frequency other than standard speeds, you are free to use any value from within an appropriate range of the SD interface given (SDMMC or SDSPI). However, the real clock frequency shall be calculated by the underlying driver and the value can be different from the one required.\\n\\nFor the SDMMC, ``max_freq_khz`` works as the upper limit so the final frequency value shall be always lower or equal.

Configuration is performed by setting members of :cpp:class:`sdmmc_slot_config_t` structure.\\n\\n    For example, to use GPIOs 1-6 for CLK, CMD, and D0-D3 signals respectively:\\n\\n    .. code-block::\\n\\n        sdmmc_slot_config_t slot = SDMMC_SLOT_CONFIG_DEFAULT();\\n        slot.clk = GPIO_NUM_1;\\n        slot.cmd = GPIO_NUM_2;\\n        slot.d0 = GPIO_NUM_3;\\n        slot.d1 = GPIO_NUM_4;\\n        slot.d2 = GPIO_NUM_5;\\n        slot.d3 = GPIO_NUM_6;\\n\\n    It is also possible to configure Card Detect and Write Protect pins. Similar to other signals, set ``cd`` and ``wp`` members of the same structure:\\n\\n    .. code-block::\\n\\n        slot.cd = GPIO_NUM_7;\\n        slot.wp = GPIO_NUM_8;\\n\\n    ``SDMMC_SLOT_CONFIG_DEFAULT`` sets both to ``GPIO_NUM_NC``, meaning that by default the signals are not used.\\n\\n    Once :cpp:class:`sdmmc_slot_config_t` structure is initialized this way, you can use it when calling :cpp:func:`sdmmc_host_init_slot` or one of the higher level functions (such as :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_sdmmc_mount`).\\n\\nDDR Mode for eMMC Chips\\n-----------------------\\n\\nBy default, DDR mode will be used if:\\n\\n- SDMMC host frequency is set to :c:macro:`SDMMC_FREQ_HIGHSPEED` in :cpp:class:`sdmmc_host_t` structure, and\\n- eMMC chip reports DDR mode support in its CSD register\\n\\nDDR mode places higher requirements for signal integrity.

       " \"Sharing the SPI Bus Among SD Cards and Other SPI Devices\\n========================================================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThe SD card has an SPI mode, enabling it to function as an SPI device, but there are some restrictions that we need to pay attention to.\\n\\nPin Loading of Other Devices\\n----------------------------\\n\\nWhen adding more devices onto the same bus, the overall pin loading increases. The loading consists of AC loading (pin capacitor) and DC loading (pull-ups).\\n\\nAC Loading\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSD cards, designed for high-speed communications, have small pin capacitors (AC loading) to work until 50 MHz. However, the other attached devices will increase the pin's AC loading.\\n\\nHeavy AC loading of a pin may prevent the pin from being toggled quickly. By using an oscilloscope, you will see the edges of the pin become smoother, i.e., the gradient of the edge is smaller. The setup timing requirements of an SD card may be violated when the card is connected to a bus with a high AC load. Even worse, high AC loads may cause the SD card and other SPI devices to fail to properly resolve clock signals from the host, affecting communication stability.\\n\\nThis issue may be more obvious if other attached devices are not designed to work at the same frequency as the SD card, because they may have larger pin capacitors. The larger the pin capacity, the greater the pin response time, the smaller the max frequency the SD bus can work.\\n\\nTo see if your pin AC loading is too heavy, you can try the following tests:\\n\\nTerminology:\\n\\n - **launch edge**: at which clock edge the data starts to toggle;\\n - **latch edge**: at which clock edge the data is supposed to be sampled by the receiver. For SD card, it is the rising edge.\\n\\n1. Use an oscilloscope to see the clock and compare the data line to the clock.\\n\\n   - If you see the clock is not fast enough, e.g., the rising/falling edge is longer than 1/4 of the clock cycle, it means the clock is skewed too much.\\n   - If you see the data line unstable before the latch edge of the clock, it means the load of the data line is too large.\\n\\n   You may also observe the corresponding phenomenon that data delayed largely from the launching edge of the clock with logic analyzers. But it is not as obvious as with an oscilloscope.\\n\\n2. Try to use a slower clock frequency.\\n\\n   If the lower frequency can work while the higher frequency cannot, it is an indication that the AC loading on the pins is too large.\\n\\nIf the AC loading of the pins is too large, you can either use other faster devices with lower pin load or slow down the clock speed.\\n\\nDC Loading\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe pull-ups required by SD cards are usually around 10 kOhm to 50 kOhm, which may be too strong for some other SPI devices.\\n\\nCheck the specification of your device about its DC output current, it should be larger than 700 μA, otherwise, the device output may not be read correctly.\\n\\nInitialization Sequence\\n-----------------------\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  If you see any problem in the following steps, please make sure the timing is correct first. You can try to slow down the clock speed, such as setting ``SDMMC_FREQ_PROBING`` to 400 kHz for SD card, to avoid the influence of pin AC loading, as discussed in the previous section.\\n\\nWhen using an SD card with other SPI devices on the same SPI bus, due to the restrictions of the SD card startup flow, the following initialization sequence should be followed. Refer to :example:`storage/sd_card` for further details.\\n\\n1. Initialize the SPI bus properly by :cpp:func:`spi_bus_initialize`.\\n\\n2. Tie the CS lines of all other devices than the SD card to idle state (by default it's high). This is to avoid conflicts with the SD card in the following step.\\n\\n   You can do this by either:\\n\\n   1. Attach devices to the SPI bus by calling :cpp:func:`spi_bus_add_device`. This function will by default initialize the GPIO that is used as CS to the idle level: high.\\n\\n   2. Initialize GPIO on the CS pin that needs to be tied up before actually adding a new device.\\n\\n   3. Rely on the internal/external pull-up (**not recommended**) to pull up all the CS pins when the GPIOs of ESP are not initialized yet. You need to check carefully the pull-up is strong enough and there are no other pull-downs that will influence the pull-up. For example, internal pull-down should be enabled.\\n\\n3. Mount the card to the filesystem by calling :cpp:func:`esp_vfs_fat_sdspi_mount`.\\n\\n   This step will put the SD card into the SPI mode, which **should** be done before all other SPI communications on the same bus. Otherwise, the card will stay in the SD mode, in which mode it may randomly respond to any SPI communications on the bus, even when its CS line is not addressed.\\n\\n   If you want to test this behavior, please also note that, once the card is put into SPI mode, it will not return to SD mode before the next power cycle, i.e., powered down and powered up again.\\n\\n4. Now you can talk to other SPI devices freely!\\n\",\n",

The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality. JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality.\\n\\nJPEG codec on {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is an image codec, which is based on the JPEG baseline standard, for compressing and decompressing images to reduce the bandwidth required to transmit images or the space required to store images, making it possible to process large-resolution images.

       " 'Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)\\n==============================\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nI2C is a serial, synchronous, multi-device, half-duplex communication protocol that allows co-existence of multiple masters and slaves on the same bus. I2C uses two bidirectional open-drain lines: serial data line (SDA) and serial clock line (SCL), pulled up by resistors.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} has {IDF_TARGET_SOC_I2C_NUM} I2C controller (also called port), responsible for handling communication on the I2C bus. A single I2C controller can be a master or a slave.\\n\\nTypically, an I2C slave device has a 7-bit address or 10-bit address. {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports both I2C Standard-mode (Sm) and Fast-mode (Fm) which can go up to 100KHz and 400KHz respectively.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    The clock frequency of SCL in master mode should not be larger than 400 KHz\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The frequency of SCL is influenced by both the pull-up resistor and the wire capacitance. Therefore, users are strongly recommended to choose appropriate pull-up resistors to make the frequency accurate. The recommended value for pull-up resistors usually ranges from 1K Ohms to 10K Ohms.\\n\\n    Keep in mind that the higher the frequency, the smaller the pull-up resistor should be (but not less than 1 KOhms). Indeed, large resistors will decline the current, which will increase the clock switching time and reduce the frequency. We usually recommend a range of 2 KOhms to 5 KOhms, but users may also need to make some adjustments depending on their current draw requirements.\\n\\n\\nI2C Clock Configuration\\n-----------------------\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - :cpp:enumerator:`i2c_clock_source_t::I2C_CLK_SRC_DEFAULT`: Default I2C source clock.\\n    :SOC_I2C_SUPPORT_XTAL: - :cpp:enumerator:`i2c_clock_source_t::I2C_CLK_SRC_XTAL`: External crystal for I2C clock source.\\n    :SOC_I2C_SUPPORT_RTC: - :cpp:enumerator:`i2c_clock_source_t::I2C_CLK_RC_FAST`: Internal 20MHz rc oscillator for I2C clock source.\\n    :SOC_I2C_SUPPORT_APB: - :cpp:enumerator:`i2c_clock_source_t::I2C_CLK_SRC_APB`: APB clock as I2C clock source.\\n    :SOC_I2C_SUPPORT_REF_TICK: - :cpp:enumerator:`i2c_clock_source_t::I2C_CLK_SRC_REF_TICK`: 1MHZ clock.\\n\\nI2C File Structure\\n------------------\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/diagrams/i2c/i2c_code_structure.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: I2C file structure\\n\\n    I2C file structure\\n\\n**Public headers that need to be included in the I2C application**\\n\\n- ``i2c.h``: The header file of legacy I2C APIs (for apps using legacy driver).\\n- ``i2c_master.h``: The header file that provides standard communication mode specific APIs (for apps using new driver with master mode).\\n- ``i2c_slave.h``: The header file that provides standard communication mode specific APIs (for apps using new driver with slave mode).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The legacy driver can\\'t coexist with the new driver.

       " 'LCD\\n===\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nESP chips can generate various kinds of timings that needed by common LCDs on the market, like SPI LCD, I80 LCD (a.k.a Intel 8080 parallel LCD), RGB/SRGB LCD, I2C LCD, etc. The ``esp_lcd`` component is officially to support those LCDs with a group of universal APIs across chips.\\n\\nFunctional Overview\\n-------------------\\n\\nIn ``esp_lcd``, an LCD panel is represented by :cpp:type:`esp_lcd_panel_handle_t`, which plays the role of an **abstract frame buffer**, regardless of the frame memory is allocated inside ESP chip or in external LCD controller. Based on the location of the frame buffer and the hardware connection interface, the LCD panel drivers are mainly grouped into the following categories:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - Controller based LCD driver involves multiple steps to get a panel handle, like bus allocation, IO device registration and controller driver install. The frame buffer is located in the controller\\'s internal GRAM (Graphical RAM). ESP-IDF provides only a limited number of LCD controller drivers out of the box (e.g., ST7789, SSD1306), :ref:`more_controller_based_lcd_drivers` are maintained in the `Espressif Component Registry <https://components.espressif.com/>`__.\\n    - :ref:`spi_lcd_panel` describes the steps to install the SPI LCD IO driver and then get the panel handle.\\n    - :ref:`i2c_lcd_panel` describes the steps to install the I2C LCD IO driver and then get the panel handle.\\n    :SOC_LCD_I80_SUPPORTED: - :ref:`i80_lcd_panel` describes the steps to install the I80 LCD IO driver and then get the panel handle.\\n    :SOC_LCD_RGB_SUPPORTED: - :ref:`rgb_lcd_panel` - is based on a group of specific synchronous signals indicating where to start and stop a frame. The frame buffer is allocated on the ESP side. The driver install steps are much simplified because we do not need to install any IO interface driver in this case.\\n    - :ref:`lcd_panel_operations` - provides a set of APIs to operate the LCD panel, like turning on/off the display, setting the orientation, etc. These operations are common for either controller-based LCD panel driver or RGB LCD panel driver.\\n\\n.. _spi_lcd_panel:\\n\\nSPI Interfaced LCD\\n------------------\\n\\n#. Create an SPI bus. Please refer to :doc:`SPI Master API doc </api-reference/peripherals/spi_master>` for more details.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        spi_bus_config_t buscfg = {\\n            .sclk_io_num = EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_SCLK,\\n            .mosi_io_num = EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_MOSI,\\n            .miso_io_num = EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_MISO,\\n            .quadwp_io_num = -1, // Quad SPI LCD driver is not yet supported\\n            .quadhd_io_num = -1, // Quad SPI LCD driver is not yet supported\\n            .max_transfer_sz = EXAMPLE_LCD_H_RES * 80 * sizeof(uint16_t), // transfer 80 lines of pixels (assume pixel is RGB565) at most in one SPI transaction\\n        };\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK(spi_bus_initialize(LCD_HOST, &buscfg, SPI_DMA_CH_AUTO)); // Enable the DMA feature\\n\\n#. Allocate an LCD IO device handle from the SPI bus. In this step, you need to provide the following information:\\n\\n    - :cpp:member:`esp_lcd_panel_io_spi_config_t::dc_gpio_num`: Sets the gpio number for the DC signal line (some LCD calls this ``RS`` line). The LCD driver uses this GPIO to switch between sending command and sending data.\\n    - :cpp:member:`esp_lcd_panel_io_spi_config_t::cs_gpio_num`: Sets the gpio number for the CS signal line. The LCD driver uses this GPIO to select the LCD chip. If the SPI bus only has one device attached (i.e., this LCD), you can set the gpio number to ``-1`` to occupy the bus exclusively.\\n    - :cpp:member:`esp_lcd_panel_io_spi_config_t::pclk_hz` sets the frequency of the pixel clock, in Hz.

You can enable this feature by setting the :cpp:member:`esp_lcd_rgb_panel_config_t::fb_in_psram` to ``true``. The downside of this is that when both the CPU as well as EDMA need access to the PSRAM, the bandwidth will be **shared** between them, that is, EDMA gets half and the CPUs get the other half. If there are other peripherals using EDMA as well, with a high enough pixel clock this can lead to starvation of the LCD peripheral, leading to display corruption.

The frame buffer that the CPU write to and the frame buffer that the EDMA read from are guaranteed to be different and independent. The EDMA will only switch between the two frame buffers when the previous write operation is finished and the current frame has been sent to the LCD. The downside of this mode is that, you have to maintain the synchronization between the two frame buffers.\\n\\n    .. code:: c\\n\\n        esp_lcd_panel_handle_t panel_handle = NULL;\\n        esp_lcd_rgb_panel_config_t panel_config = {\\n            .data_width = 16, // RGB565 in parallel mode, thus 16bit in width\\n            .num_fbs = 2,     // allocate double frame buffer\\n            .clk_src = LCD_CLK_SRC_DEFAULT,\\n            .disp_gpio_num = EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_DISP_EN,\\n            .pclk_gpio_num = EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_PCLK,\\n            .vsync_gpio_num = EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_VSYNC,\\n            .hsync_gpio_num = EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_HSYNC,\\n            .de_gpio_num = EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_DE,\\n            .data_gpio_nums = {\\n                EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_DATA0,\\n                EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_DATA1,\\n                EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_DATA2,\\n                // other GPIOs\\n                // The number of GPIOs here should be the same to the value of `data_width` above\\n                ...\\n            },\\n            // The timing parameters should refer to your LCD spec\\n            .timings = {\\n                .pclk_hz = EXAMPLE_LCD_PIXEL_CLOCK_HZ,\\n                .h_res = EXAMPLE_LCD_H_RES,\\n                .v_res = EXAMPLE_LCD_V_RES,\\n                .hsync_back_porch = 40,\\n                .hsync_front_porch = 20,\\n                .hsync_pulse_width = 1,\\n                .vsync_back_porch = 8,\\n                .vsync_front_porch = 4,\\n                .vsync_pulse_width = 1,\\n            },\\n            .flags.fb_in_psram = true, // allocate frame buffer from PSRAM\\n        };\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_lcd_new_rgb_panel(&panel_config, &panel_handle));\\n\\n    .. _bounce_buffer_with_single_psram_frame_buffer:\\n\\n    Bounce Buffer with Single PSRAM Frame Buffer\\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n    This mode allocates two so-called ``bounce buffers`` from the internal memory, and a main frame buffer that is still in PSRAM. This mode is selected by setting the :cpp:member:`esp_lcd_rgb_panel_config_t::fb_in_psram` flag and additionally specifying a non-zero :cpp:member:`esp_lcd_rgb_panel_config_t::bounce_buffer_size_px` value. The bounce buffers only need to be large enough to hold a few lines of display data, which is significantly less than the main frame buffer. The LCD peripheral uses DMA to read data from one of the bounce buffers, and meanwhile an interrupt routine uses the CPU DCache to copy data from the main PSRAM frame buffer into the other bounce buffer. Once the LCD peripheral has finished reading the bounce buffer, the two buffers change place and the CPU can fill the others. The advantage of this mode is that, you can achieve higher pixel clock frequency. As the bounce buffers are larger than the FIFOs in the EDMA path, this method is also more robust against short bandwidth spikes. The downside is a major increase in CPU use and the LCD **CAN NOT** work if we disable the cache of the external memory, via e.g., OTA or NVS write to the main flash.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        It is highly recommended to turn on the \"PSRAM XIP (Execute In Place)\" feature in this mode by enabling the Kconfig options: :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_FETCH_INSTRUCTIONS` and :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_RODATA`, which allows the CPU to fetch instructions and readonly data from the PSRAM instead of the main flash. What is more, the external memory cache will not be disabled even if you attempt to write to the main flash through SPI1. This makes it possible to display an OTA progress bar for your application.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        This mode still has another problem which is also caused by insufficient PSRAM bandwidth. e.g., when your draw buffers are allocated from PSRAM, and their contents are copied into the internal frame buffer on CPU core 1. On CPU core 0, there is another memory copy happening in the DMA EOF ISR. In this situation, both CPUs are accessing the PSRAM by cache and sharing the bandwidth of the PSRAM. This increases the memory copy time that spent in the DMA EOF ISR significantly. The driver can not switch the bounce buffer in time, thus leading to a shift on the LCD screen. Although the driver can detect such a condition and perform a restart in the LCD\\'s VSYNC interrupt handler, you still can see a flickering on the screen.\\n\\n    .. code:: c\\n\\n        esp_lcd_panel_handle_t panel_handle = NULL;\\n        esp_lcd_rgb_panel_config_t panel_config = {\\n            .data_width = 16, // RGB565 in parallel mode, thus 16bit in width\\n            .clk_src = LCD_CLK_SRC_DEFAULT,\\n            .bounce_buffer_size_px = 10 * EXAMPLE_LCD_H_RES, // allocate 10 lines data as bounce buffer from internal memory\\n            .disp_gpio_num = EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_DISP_EN,\\n            .pclk_gpio_num = EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_PCLK,\\n            .vsync_gpio_num = EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_VSYNC,\\n            .hsync_gpio_num = EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_HSYNC,\\n            .de_gpio_num = EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_DE,\\n            .data_gpio_nums = {\\n                EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_DATA0,\\n                EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_DATA1,\\n                EXAMPLE_PIN_NUM_DATA2,\\n                // other GPIOs\\n                // The number of GPIOs here should be the same to the value of `data_width` above\\n                ...\\n            },\\n            // The timing parameters should refer to your LCD spec\\n            .timings = {\\n                .pclk_hz = EXAMPLE_LCD_PIXEL_CLOCK_HZ,\\n                .h_res = EXAMPLE_LCD_H_RES,\\n                .v_res = EXAMPLE_LCD_V_RES,\\n                .hsync_back_porch = 40,\\n                .hsync_front_porch = 20,\\n                .hsync_pulse_width = 1,\\n                .vsync_back_porch = 8,\\n                .vsync_front_porch = 4,\\n                .vsync_pulse_width = 1,\\n            },\\n            .flags.fb_in_psram = true, // allocate frame buffer from PSRAM\\n        };\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK(esp_lcd_new_rgb_panel(&panel_config, &panel_handle));\\n\\n    Note that this mode also allows for a :cpp:member:`esp_lcd_rgb_panel_config_t::bb_invalidate_cache` flag to be set. Enabling this frees up the cache lines after they are used to read out the frame buffer data from PSRAM, but it may lead to slight corruption if the other core writes data to the frame buffer at the exact time the cache lines are freed up. (Technically, a write to the frame buffer can be ignored if it falls between the cache writeback and the cache invalidate calls.)\\n\\n    .. _bounce_buffer_only:\\n\\n    Bounce Buffer Only\\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n    This mode is similar to the :ref:`bounce_buffer_with_single_psram_frame_buffer`, but there is no PSRAM frame buffer initialized by the LCD driver. Instead, the user supplies a callback function that is responsible for filling the bounce buffers. As this driver does not care where the written pixels come from, this allows for the callback doing e.g., on-the-fly conversion from a smaller, 8-bit-per-pixel PSRAM frame buffer to an 16-bit LCD, or even procedurally-generated frame-buffer-less graphics. This option is selected by setting the :cpp:member:`esp_lcd_rgb_panel_config_t::no_fb` flag and supplying a :cpp:member:`esp_lcd_rgb_panel_config_t::bounce_buffer_size_px` value. And then register the :cpp:member:`esp_lcd_rgb_panel_event_callbacks_t::on_bounce_empty` callback by calling :cpp:func:`esp_lcd_rgb_panel_register_event_callbacks`.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        It should never happen in a well-designed embedded application, but it can in theory be possible that the DMA cannot deliver data as fast as the LCD consumes it. In the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} hardware, this leads to the LCD simply outputting dummy bytes while DMA waits for data. If we were to run DMA in a stream fashion, this would mean a de-sync between the LCD address the DMA reads the data for and the LCD address the LCD peripheral thinks it outputs data for, leading to a **permanently** shifted image.\\n        In order to stop this from happening, you can either enable the :ref:`CONFIG_LCD_RGB_RESTART_IN_VSYNC` option, so the driver can restart the DMA in the VBlank interrupt automatically or call :cpp:func:`esp_lcd_rgb_panel_restart` to restart the DMA manually. Note :cpp:func:`esp_lcd_rgb_panel_restart` does not restart the DMA immediately, the DMA is still restarted in the next VSYNC event.\\n\\n    .. _lcd_panel_operations:\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_LCD_RGB_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    .. _lcd_panel_operations:\\n\\nLCD Panel Basic Operations\\n--------------------------\\n\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_lcd_panel_reset` can reset the LCD panel.\\n* :cpp:func:`esp_lcd_panel_init` performs a basic initialization of the panel.

(See more in `IRAM Safe <#iram-safe>`__)\\n\\nEnable and Disable Unit\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`ana_cmpr_enable` - Enable the Analog Comparator unit.\\n- :cpp:func:`ana_cmpr_disable` - Disable the Analog Comparator unit.\\n\\nAfter the Analog Comparator unit is enabled and the crossing event interrupt is enabled, a power management lock will be acquired if the power management is enabled (see `Power Management <#power-management>`__). Under the **enable** state, only :cpp:func:`ana_cmpr_set_intl_reference` and :cpp:func:`ana_cmpr_set_debounce` can be called, other functions can only be called after the unit is disabled.\\n\\nCalling :cpp:func:`ana_cmpr_disable` does the opposite.\\n\\nPower Management\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen power management is enabled (i.e., :ref:`CONFIG_PM_ENABLE` is on), the system will adjust the APB frequency before going into light sleep, thus potentially changing the resolution of the Analog Comparator.\\n\\nHowever, the driver can prevent the system from changing APB frequency by acquiring a power management lock of type :cpp:enumerator:`ESP_PM_NO_LIGHT_SLEEP`. Whenever the driver creates a Analog Comparator unit instance that has selected the clock source like :cpp:enumerator:`ANA_CMPR_CLK_SRC_DEFAULT` or :cpp:enumerator:`ANA_CMPR_CLK_SRC_XTAL` as its clock source, the driver guarantees that the power management lock is acquired when enable the channel by :cpp:func:`ana_cmpr_enable`. Likewise, the driver releases the lock when :cpp:func:`ana_cmpr_disable` is called for that channel.\\n\\nIRAM Safe\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy default, the Analog Comparator interrupt will be deferred when the Cache is disabled for reasons like programming/erasing Flash. Thus the alarm interrupt will not get executed in time, which is not expected in a real-time application.\\n\\nThere is a Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_ANA_CMPR_ISR_IRAM_SAFE` that:\\n\\n1. Enables the interrupt being serviced even when cache is disabled\\n2. Places all functions that used by the ISR into IRAM [1]_\\n3. Places driver object into DRAM (in case it is allocated on PSRAM)\\n\\nThis allows the interrupt to run while the cache is disabled but comes at the cost of increased IRAM consumption.\\n\\nThere is a Kconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_ANA_CMPR_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM` that can put commonly used IO control functions into IRAM as well. So that these functions can also be executable when the cache is disabled. These IO control functions are listed as follows:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`ana_cmpr_set_internal_reference`\\n- :cpp:func:`ana_cmpr_set_debounce`\\n- :cpp:func:`ana_cmpr_set_cross_type`\\n\\nThread Safety\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe factory function :cpp:func:`ana_cmpr_new_unit` is guaranteed to be thread safe by the driver, which means, user can call it from different RTOS tasks without protection by extra locks.\\nThe following functions are allowed to run under ISR context, the driver uses a critical section to prevent them being called concurrently in both task and ISR.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`ana_cmpr_set_internal_reference`\\n- :cpp:func:`ana_cmpr_set_debounce`\\n- :cpp:func:`ana_cmpr_set_cross_type`\\n\\nOther functions that take the :cpp:type:`ana_cmpr_handle_t` as the first positional parameter, are not treated as thread safe. Which means the user should avoid calling them from multiple tasks.\\n\\nKconfig Options\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_ANA_CMPR_ISR_IRAM_SAFE` controls whether the default ISR handler can work when cache is disabled, see `IRAM Safe <#iram-safe>`__ for more information.\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_ANA_CMPR_CTRL_FUNC_IN_IRAM` controls where to place the Analog Comparator control functions (IRAM or Flash), see `IRAM Safe <#iram-safe>`__ for more information.\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_ANA_CMPR_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG` is used to enabled the debug log output. Enabling this option increases the firmware binary size.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_ANA_CMPR_SUPPORT_ETM\\n\\n    ETM Events\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    To create an analog comparator cross event, you need to include ``driver/ana_cmpr_etm.h`` additionally, and allocate the event by :cpp:func:`ana_cmpr_new_etm_event`.

Different ESP chips might have different numbers of independent ADCs. From the oneshot mode driver\\'s point of view, an ADC instance is represented by :cpp:type:`adc_oneshot_unit_handle_t`.\\n\\nTo install an ADC instance, set up the required initial configuration structure :cpp:type:`adc_oneshot_unit_init_cfg_t`:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`adc_oneshot_unit_init_cfg_t::unit_id` selects the ADC. Please refer to the `datasheet <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}>`__ to know dedicated analog IOs for this ADC.\\n- :cpp:member:`adc_oneshot_unit_init_cfg_t::clk_src` selects the source clock of the ADC. If set to 0, the driver will fall back to using a default clock source, see :cpp:type:`adc_oneshot_clk_src_t` to know the details.\\n- :cpp:member:`adc_oneshot_unit_init_cfg_t::ulp_mode` sets if the ADC will be working under ULP mode.\\n\\n.. todo::\\n\\n   Add ULP ADC-related docs here.\\n\\nAfter setting up the initial configurations for the ADC, call :cpp:func:`adc_oneshot_new_unit` with the prepared :cpp:type:`adc_oneshot_unit_init_cfg_t`. This function will return an ADC unit handle if the allocation is successful.\\n\\nThis function may fail due to various errors such as invalid arguments, insufficient memory, etc. Specifically, when the to-be-allocated ADC instance is registered already, this function will return :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_FOUND` error. Number of available ADC(s) is recorded by :c:macro:`SOC_ADC_PERIPH_NUM`.\\n\\nIf a previously created ADC instance is no longer required, you should recycle the ADC instance by calling :cpp:func:`adc_oneshot_del_unit`, related hardware and software resources will be recycled as well.\\n\\nCreate an ADC Unit Handle Under Normal Oneshot Mode\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    adc_oneshot_unit_handle_t adc1_handle;\\n    adc_oneshot_unit_init_cfg_t init_config1 = {\\n        .unit_id = ADC_UNIT_1,\\n        .ulp_mode = ADC_ULP_MODE_DISABLE,\\n    };\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(adc_oneshot_new_unit(&init_config1, &adc1_handle));\\n\\n\\nRecycle the ADC Unit\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n.. code:: c\\n\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK(adc_oneshot_del_unit(adc1_handle));\\n\\n\\n.. _adc-oneshot-unit-configuration:\\n\\nUnit Configuration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAfter an ADC instance is created, set up the :cpp:type:`adc_oneshot_chan_cfg_t` to configure ADC IOs to measure analog signal:\\n\\n- :cpp:member:`adc_oneshot_chan_cfg_t::atten`, ADC attenuation.

Call :cpp:func:`adc_oneshot_read` to get the conversion raw result of an ADC channel.\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`adc_oneshot_read` is safe to use. ADC(s) are shared by some other drivers/peripherals, see :ref:`hardware_limitations_adc_oneshot`. This function uses mutexes to avoid concurrent hardware usage. Therefore, this function should not be used in an ISR context. This function may fail when the ADC is in use by other drivers/peripherals, and return :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT`. Under this condition, the ADC raw result is invalid.\\n\\nThis function will fail due to invalid arguments.\\n\\nThe ADC conversion results read from this function are raw data.

       " \"SD Pull-up Requirements\\n=======================\\n\\nEspressif hardware products are designed for multiple use cases which may require different pull states on pins. For this reason, the pull state of particular pins on certain products needs to be adjusted to provide the pull-ups required in the SD bus.\\n\\nSD pull-up requirements apply to cases where {IDF_TARGET_NAME} uses the SPI or SDMMC controller to communicate with SD cards. When an SD card is operating in SPI mode or 1-bit SD mode, the CMD and DATA (DAT0 - DAT3) lines of the SD bus must be pulled up by 10 kOhm resistors. SD cards and SDIO devices should also have pull-ups on all above-mentioned lines (regardless of whether these lines are connected to the host) in order to prevent them from entering a wrong state.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    By default, the MTDI bootstrapping pin is incompatible with the DAT2 line pull-up if the flash voltage is 3.3 V.

This permanently configures the internal regulator's output voltage to 3.3 V, and GPIO12 will not be used as a bootstrapping pin. After that, connect a pull-up resistor to GPIO12.\\n\\n    .. warning::\\n\\n        Burning eFuses is irreversible! The issue list above might be out of date, so please make sure that the module you are burning has a 3.3 V flash chip by checking the information on https://www.espressif.com/. If you burn the 3.3 V eFuses on a module with a 1.8 V flash chip, the module will stop functioning.\\n\\n    If you are sure that you need to irreversibly burn eFuses, go to your ESP-IDF directory and run the following command:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n        components/esptool_py/esptool/espefuse.py set_flash_voltage 3.3V\\n\\n    This command burns the ``XPD_SDIO_TIEH``, ``XPD_SDIO_FORCE``, and ``XPD_SDIO_REG`` eFuses. After all the three eFuses are burned to value 1, the internal VDD_SDIO flash voltage regulator is permanently set to 3.3 V. You will see the following log if the burning succeeds:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n        espefuse.py v2.6\\n        Connecting....\\n\\n        Enable internal flash voltage regulator (VDD_SDIO) to 3.3 V.\\n        The following eFuses are burned: XPD_SDIO_FORCE, XPD_SDIO_REG, XPD_SDIO_TIEH.\\n        This is an irreversible operation.\\n        Type 'BURN' (all capitals) to continue.\\n        BURN\\n        VDD_SDIO setting complete.\\n\\n    To check the status of the eFuses, run::\\n\\n        ``components/esptool_py/esptool/espefuse.py summary``\\n\\n    If running from an automated flashing script, ``espefuse.py`` has an option ``--do-not-confirm``.\\n\\n    For more details, see **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#efuse>`__].\\n\\n    2. **If using 1-bit SD mode or SPI mode**, disconnect the DAT2 pin and make sure it is pulled high. For this, do one the following:\\n\\n        - Leave the host's DAT2 floating and directly connect the slave's DAT2 to VDD.\\n        - For a slave device, build a firmware with the option ``SDIO_SLAVE_FLAG_DAT2_DISABLED`` and re-flash your device. This option helps avoid slave detecting on the DAT2 line. Note that 4-bit SD mode is no longer supported by the standard Card Common Control Register (CCCR); however, the host is not aware of that. The use of 4-bit SD mode has to be disabled on the host's side.\\n\\n\\n    .. _no_pull-up_on_gpio12:\\n\\n    No Pull-up on GPIO12\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Your module is compatible with the SDIO protocol.

This pin has an internal pull-down, so, if left unconnected, it will read low level at startup, which leads to selecting the default 3.3 V operation.\\n\\n    All ESP32-WROVER modules, excluding ESP32-WROVER-B, use 1.8 V flash and have internal pull-ups on GPIO12. Other modules that use 3.3 V flash have no pull-ups on the GPIO12 pin, and this pin is slightly pulled down internally.\\n\\n    When adding a pull-up to this pin for SD card operation, consider the following:\\n\\n    - For boards that do not use the internal regulator (VDD_SDIO) to power flash, GPIO12 can be pulled high.\\n    - For boards using 1.8 V flash chips, GPIO12 needs to be pulled high at reset. This is fully compatible with the SD card operation.\\n    - On boards using the internal regulator and a 3.3 V flash chip, GPIO12 must be pulled low at reset. This is incompatible with the SD card operation. For reference information on compatibility of Espressif's boards with the SD card operation, see :ref:`compatibility_overview_espressif_hw_sdio`.\\n\\n\\n    Internal Pull-ups and Strapping Requirements\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Using external resistors is always preferable. However, Espressif's products have internal weak pull-up and pull-down resistors which can be enabled and used instead of external ones. Please keep in mind that this solution cannot guarantee reliable SDIO communication.\\n\\n    With that said, the information about these internal pull-ups and strapping requirements can still be useful. Espressif hardware products have different weak internal pull-ups/pull-downs connected to CMD and DATA pins.

       " \"USB Host Maintainers Notes (Architecture)\\n=========================================\\n\\nThe Host Stack is roughly split into multiple layers of abstraction, with each layer representing different USB concepts and a different level of USB Host operation. For example, a higher layer may present an abstraction of devices and application data transfers, whereas a lower layer may present an abstraction of endpoints and USB transfers.\\n\\nLayer Descriptions\\n------------------\\n\\nThe layers of the Host Stack are described in the following table. The layers are ordered from lowest layer (i.e, furthest away from the user) to highest layer (i.e., closest to the user).\\n\\n.. list-table:: Host Stack Layers\\n    :widths: 20 10 70\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Layer\\n      - Files\\n      - Description\\n    * - Host Controller (DWC_OTG)\\n      - N/A\\n      - This layer represents the USB Controller Hardware of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. The API presented by this layer is the register interface of the controller.\\n    * - LL\\n      - ``usbh_ll.h``\\n      - The LL (Low Level) layer abstracts the basic register access of the USB controller according to ESP-IDF's :doc:`Hardware Abstraction API Guidelines <../../../api-guides/hardware-abstraction>`. In other words, this layer provides APIs to access the controller's registers and format/parse the controller's DMA descriptors.\\n    * - HAL\\n      - ``usbh_hal.h``, ``usbh_hal.c``\\n      - The HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) abstracts the operating steps of the USB controller into functions according to ESP-IDF's :doc:`Hardware Abstraction API Guidelines <../../../api-guides/hardware-abstraction>`. This layer also abstracts the controller's host port and host channels, and provides APIs to operate the them.\\n    * - HCD\\n      - ``hcd.h``, ``hcd.c``\\n      - The HCD (Host Controller Driver) acts as hardware agnostic API for all USB controllers (i.e., an API that can theoretically be used with any USB controller implementation). This layer also abstracts the root port (i.e., root hub) and USB pipes.\\n    * - USBH and Hub Driver\\n      - ``usbh.h``, ``usbh.c``\\n      - The USBH (USB Host Driver) layer is equivalent to the USBD layer described in chapter 10 of the USB2.0 specification. The USBH presents an abstraction of USB devices, internally manages a list of connected devices (i.e., device pool), and also arbitrates device sharing between clients (i.e., tracks which endpoints are in use and also presents a shared endpoint 0).\\n    * - Hub Driver\\n      - ``hub.h``, ``hub.c``\\n      - The Hub Driver layer acts as a special client of the USBH that is responsible for handling device attachment/detachment, and notifying the USBH of such events. For device attachment, the Hub Driver also handles the enumeration process as well.\\n    * - USB Host Library\\n      - ``usb_host.h``, ``usb_host.c``\\n      - The USB Host Library layer is the lowest public API layer of the Host Stack and presents the concept of USB Host Clients. The abstraction of clients allows for multiple class drivers to coexist simultaneously (where each class roughly maps to a single client) and also acts as a mechanism for division of labor (where each client is responsible for its own processing and event handling).\\n    * - Host Class Drivers\\n      - See the `ESP-IDF Extra Components repository <https://github.com/espressif/idf-extra-components>`_ or the USB Host examples in ESP-IDF (via :example:`peripherals/usb/host`).\\n      - The Host Class Drivers implement the host side of a particular device class (e.g., CDC, MSC, HID). The exposed API is specific to each class driver.\\n\\nLayer Dependencies\\n------------------\\n\\nThe Host Stack roughly follows a top to bottom hierarchy with inter-layer dependencies. Given layers A (highest), B, and C (lowest), the Host Stack has the following inter-layer dependency rules:\\n\\n- a particular layer can use the API of any layer directly below (Layer A using layer B is allowed)\\n- a particular layer can use the API of any layer indirectly below (Layer A using layer C is allowed) i.e., skipping layers.\\n- a particular layer must not use the API of any layer above (Layer C using layer A/B is forbidden)\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  Layer skipping is permitted in order to circumvent the need to repeat the same abstraction across multiple layers. For example, the abstraction of pipes are presented at the HCD layer but are used by multiple layers above.\\n\\n.. todo::\\n\\n  Add diagram of API dependencies between layers\\n\",\n",
       " \"USB Host Maintainers Notes (Design Guidelines)\\n==============================================\\n\\nDesign Considerations\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe design of the Host Stack takes into account the following design considerations:\\n\\n**Limited Hardware Resources:**\\n\\nThe embedded nature of Host Stack means limited hardware resources (such as memory and processing power) when compared to larger host systems.\\n\\n**USB2.0 Chapter 10:**\\n\\nChapter 10 of the USB 2.0 specification specifies certain requirements of USB Host systems, in particular the required layers of the USB Host's system software.\\n\\n**Diverse Use Case Complexities:**\\n\\nThe embedded nature of the Host Stack also means a wide range of use cases with differing complexities. Some USB Host applications aim to only support a single vendor specific device, whereas other applications require support for a wide range of devices of different classes.\\n\\nRequirements\\n------------\\n\\nGiven the design considerations above, the Host Stack was designed with the following set of requirements:\\n\\nDMA Support\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n**Requirement: The Host Stack must support DMA.**\\n\\nThe Host Stack must support DMA in order to reduce CPU's workload. DMA support allows the automatic copying of USB transfer data to/from the Host Controller without CPU intervention. This is especially critical given the embedded nature of the CPU (i.e., lower CPU frequencies) and large maximum data payloads of USB transfers (e.g., 1023 bytes for isochronous transfers).\\n\\nMinimize Memory Copies\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n**Requirement: The Host Stack should minimize the amount of memory copies when passing data between layers.**\\n\\nVarious data and objects (e.g., USB transfers) need to be passed between multiple layers of the Host Stack. The Host Stack should minimize the amount of memory copies that occur between layers by allocating the data's/object's memory once, and simply passing a pointer to that data/object between the layers. Therefore, the Host Stack requires some standardized data types shared across multiple layers (see USB2.0 Section 10.3.4).\\n\\nEvent Driven\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n**Requirement: The Host Stack must allow for event driven operation (i.e., the Host Stack's API must not be polling).**\\n\\nThe Host Stack needs to support some CPU intensive use application scenarios such as video streaming (i.e., UVC class). Therefore, the Host Stack should minimize CPU usage by allowing for completely event driven operation, thus reserving the majority of CPU time for the application itself (i.e., video encoding/decoding in this case).\\n\\nThe Host Stack needs to communicate events across the layers using interrupts, callbacks, and FreeRTOS synchronization primitives (e.g., queues and semaphores).\\n\\nNo Task Creation\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n**Requirement: All layers of the Host Stack below (and including) the Host Library layer must not create any tasks.**\\n\\nTask stacks are generally one of the most memory intensive parts of an ESP-IDF applications. Given the wide range of applications scenarios, the number of tasks created (and their stack sizes) can vary greatly. For example...\\n\\n- applications that require low latency or high throughput (such as isochronous transfers) may choose to create a dedicated task to handle those transfers in order to minimize latency.\\n- applications that do not have strict latency requirements (such as bulk transfers) may choose to handle those transfers from a shared task in order to save some memory.\\n\\nTherefore, all layers of the Host Stack below (and including) the Host Library layer **must not** create any tasks. Instead, these layers should expose handlers functions to be called from tasks created by the upper layers. Task creation will be delegated to the class driver or application layer.\\n\\nOperable at Different Layers\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nGiven the wide range of use case complexities, the Host Stack must be operable at different layers, allowing users to use the Host Stack at a lower layer (e.g., the HCD or HAL) or at a higher layer (e.g., a class driver).\\n\\nBeing operable at different layers allows the users to decide on the appropriate trade-off between convenience, control, and optimization for their application when using the Host Stack. For example...\\n\\n- Host Stack applications that support a dedicated custom device may want to use a lower level of abstraction for better optimization, control, and simpler API.\\n- Host Stack applications that need to support a wide range of device classes requires the full Host Stack so that device enumeration is automatically handled.\\n\\nCoding Conventions\\n------------------\\n\\nThe Host Stack follows the following set of coding rules/guidelines for better code readability and maintainability:\\n\\nSymbols Use Layer Name As Prefix\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFor each layer of the Host Stack, the symbols exposed by that layer (i.e., functions, types, macros) must be prefixed with that layer's name. For example, the symbols exposed by the HCD layer will be prefixed ``hcd_...``/``HCD_...``.\\n\\nHowever, internal symbols (e.g., static functions) **should not** be prefixed with their layer's name. This makes it easier to differentiate between internal and external symbols when modifying that layer's source code.\\n\\nCritical Section Functions Prefixed With ``_``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn each layer of the Host Stack, there are various static functions that must be called inside a critical section. The names of these functions are prefixed with ``_`` (e.g., ``_func_called_from_crit()``) to make it easier for maintainers to differentiate which functions should be called from critical sections. For example...\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n  some_func();  // Called outside critical section\\n  taskENTER_CRITICAL(&some_lock);\\n  _some_func_crit();  // Called inside critical section. _ prefix makes it easier to differentiate\\n  taskEXIT_CRITICAL(&some_lock);\\n\\nGrouping Structure Members by Locking Mechanism\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSome layers of the Host Stack utilize multiple locking schemes (e.g., critical sections and task mutexes) to ensure thread safety, where each locking scheme offers a different level of protection. However, member variables of the same object can be protected by different locking scheme. Therefore, to clearly demarcate the different locking schemes and their associated variables, structure members are grouped by locking scheme as nested structures.\\n\\n.. list-table:: Locking Scheme\\n    :widths: 10 10 80\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Locking Scheme\\n      - Nested Structure\\n      - Description\\n    * - Critical Sections\\n      - ``dynamic``\\n      - Shared data accessed from both a task context and ISR context are protected by a critical section.\\n    * - Task Mutexes\\n      - ``mux_protected``\\n      - Shared data accessed from only a task context are protected by a FreeRTOS Mutex\\n    * - Single Thread\\n      - ``single_thread``\\n      - Data that is only ever accessed by the same task do not require the use of any locks.\\n    * - Constant\\n      - ``constant``\\n      - Constant data is set once during the object's instantiation and never changed again. Thus, any task or ISR can freely the constant data without the use of locks, so long as the variable is never written to.\\n\\nGrouping structure members by locking scheme makes the code more maintainable as it makes clear which locking scheme is required when accessing a particular member variable, as demonstrated in the code snippet below:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    typedef struct some_obj some_obj_t;\\n\\n    some_obj_t obj;\\n\\n    // Accessing dynamic members requires critical section\\n    taskENTER_CRITICAL(&some_lock);\\n    obj.dynamic.varA = 1;\\n    taskEXIT_CRITICAL(&some_lock);\\n\\n    // Accessing mutex protected members requires taking the mutex\\n    xSemaphoreTake(&some_mux, portMAX_DELAY);\\n    obj.mux_protected.varB = 1;\\n    xSemaphoreGive(&some_mux);\\n\\n    // Accessing single thread members does not require locking so long as this is the only task to access it\\n    obj.single_thread.varC = 1;\\n\\n    // Accessing constant members requires no locking. But only read access is allowed\\n    int local_var = obj.constant.varD;\\n\",\n",
       " \"USB Host Maintainers Notes (DWC_OTG Controller)\\n===============================================\\n\\nThe {IDF_TARGET_NAME} uses a DesignWare USB 2.0 On-the-Go Controller (henceforth referred to as DWC_OTG in this document) as its underlying hardware controller, where the DWC_OTG operates in Host Mode with Scatter/Gather DMA enabled.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    This section only summarizes the operation of the DWC_OTG operation in Host Mode at a high level. For full details of the DWC_OTG, refer to the DWC_OTG Databook and Programming Guide.\\n\\nHost Mode Operating Model\\n-------------------------\\n\\nA simplified version of the operating model of the DWC_OTG in Host Mode is illustrated in the diagram below. The diagram contains some of the key concepts and terms regarding DWC_OTG Host Mode.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../../_static/usb_host/dwc-otg-operation.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: DWC_OTG Host Mode Operating Model\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Refer to Databook section 2.1.4 (Host Architecture) for more details\\n\\nHost Port\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe Host Port represents the single USB port provided by the DWC_OTG (in USB terms, this can be thought a single USB port of the root hub of the bus). The Host Port can only connect to a single device, though more devices can be connected via hub devices.\\n\\nThe Host Port is responsible for:\\n\\n- detecting direct device connections/disconnections\\n- detecting the speed of the directly connected device\\n- issuing various bus signals (such as suspend, resume, reset)\\n\\nHost Channels\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn Host Mode, the DWC_OTG uses channels to communicate with device endpoints, where one channel maps to a particular endpoint (in USB terms, channels are the hardware representation of pipes). For example, a channel will map to EP 1 OUT. Each channel has its own set of CSRs (Control and Status Registers) so that they can independently configured and controlled independently. A channel's CSRs are used to...\\n\\n- specify the details of the channel's target endpoint (e.g., device address, EP number, transfer type, direction)\\n- start a transfer on the channel (e.g., by setting up DMA descriptors)\\n\\nWhen using Scatter/Gather DMA, transfers on Host Channels are completely event driven. Users simply fill out the appropriate DMA descriptors, fill in the channel's CSRs, then enable the channel. The channel will then generate an interrupt when the transfer completes.\\n\\nData FIFOs\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn Host Mode, the DWC_OTG uses multiple FIFOs as a staging area for the data payloads of USB transfers. When using DMA, the DMA engine will copy data between the TX/RX FIFOs and {IDF_TARGET_NAME}'s internal memory:\\n\\n- For an OUT transfer, the transfer's data payload is copied from main memory to one of the TX FIFOs by DMA. The MAC Layer will then transmit that data payload in accordance to USB packet formatting.\\n- For an IN transfer, the MAC Layer will parse the received USB packet and store the received data payload in the RX FIFO. The data is then copied to main memory by DMA.\\n\\nThe destination FIFO depends on the direction and transfer type of the channel:\\n\\n- All IN channel data goes to the RX FIFO\\n- All non-periodic (i.e., Control and Bulk) OUT channel data goes to the Non-periodic TX (NPTX) FIFO\\n- All periodic (i.e., Interrupt and Isochronous) OUT channel data goes to the Periodic TX (PTX) FIFO\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The separation of non-periodic and periodic OUT channels to the NPTX and PTX FIFOs is due to the periodic nature of Interrupt and Isochronous endpoints (specified by the ``bInterval`` value of the endpoint). The DWC_OTG automatically schedules these periodic transfers, thus a separate PTX FIFO allows these periodic transfers to be staged separately.\\n\\nDMA Engine\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe DMA engine is responsible for copying data between the FIFOs and main memory. In Host Mode Scatter/Gather DMA, a particular channel can carry out multiple transfers automatically without software intervention. The following diagram illustrates the DWC_OTG Host Mode Scatter/Gather DMA Memory Structures.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../../_static/usb_host/dwc-otg-scatter-gather.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: DWC_OTG Host Mode Scatter/Gather DMA Memory Structures\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n- Each USB transfer is described by a Queue Transfer Descriptor (QTD). Each QTD consists of:\\n\\n  - A 32-bit Buffer Status Quadlet specifying details of the transfer, and also reports the status of the transfer on completion. The Buffer Status Quadlet has bits to specify whether the QTD should generate an interrupt and/or halt the channel on completion.\\n  - A 32-bit pointer to the data buffer containing the data payload for OUT transfers, or an empty buffer used to store the data payload for IN transfers.\\n\\n- The data payload of each QTD can be larger than the MPS (Maximum Packet Size) of its target endpoint. The DWC_OTG hardware automatically handles splitting of the transfer into multiple transactions.\\n- Multiple QTDs can be placed into a single QTD List. A channel will then execute each QTD in the list automatically, and optionally loop back around if configured to do so.\\n- Before a channel starts data transfer, it is configured with a QTD list (and QTD list length). Once the channel is enabled, USB transfers are executed automatically by the hardware.\\n- A channel can generate interrupts (configurable) on completion of a particular QTD, or an entire QTD list.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Refer to Programming Guide section 6.2.1 (Descriptor Memory Structures) for more details\\n\\nHardware Configuration\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe DWC_OTG IP is configurable. The notable Host related configurations of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}'s DWC_OTG are listed below:\\n\\n.. list-table:: {IDF_TARGET_NAME}'s DWC_OTG Configuration\\n    :widths: 70 30\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Description\\n      - Configuration\\n    * - Host and Device Mode support with OTG\\n      - ``OTG_MODE = 0``\\n    * - Full Speed (FS) and Low Speed (LS) support\\n      - ``OTG_FSPHY_INTERFACE = 1``, ``OTG_HSPHY_INTERFACE = 0``\\n    * - Internal DMA controller with Scatter/Gather DMA\\n      - ``OTG_ARCHITECTURE = 2``, ``OTG_EN_DESC_DMA = 1``\\n    * - FS Hubs are supported but HS Hub are not (i.e., split transfers not supported)\\n      - ``OTG_SINGLE_POINT = 0``\\n    * - 8 Host Mode channels\\n      - ``OTG_NUM_HOST_CHAN = 8``\\n    * - All transfer types supported, including ISOC and INTR OUT transfers\\n      - ``OTG_EN_PERIO_HOST = 1``\\n    * - Dynamically sized Data FIFO of 1024 bytes (256 lines)\\n      - ``OTG_DFIFO_DYNAMIC = 1``, ``OTG_DFIFO_DEPTH = 256``\\n\\nScatter/Gather DMA Transfer\\n---------------------------\\n\\nThe basic operating procedure for Host channels transfers consists of the following steps:\\n\\n#. Prepare data buffers, QTDs, and QTD list. In particular, which QTDs should halt the channel (and generate an interrupt) on completion.\\n#. Set channel/endpoint characteristics via CSRs (such as EP address, transfer type, EP MPS etc).\\n#. Set channel's QTD list related CSRs (such as QTD list pointer and QTD list length) and channel interrupt CSRs\\n#. Enable the channel. Transfers are now handled automatically by hardware using DMA.\\n#. The Channel generates an interrupt on a channel event (e.g., QTD completion or channel error).\\n#. Parse the channel interrupt to determine what event occurred.\\n#. Parse the QTDs to determine the result of each individual transfer.\\n\\nHowever, there are some minor differences in channel operation and QTD list usage depending on the transfer type.\\n\\nBulk\\n^^^^\\n\\nBulk transfers are a simplest. Each QTD represents a bulk transfer of a particular direction, where the DWC_OTG automatically splits a particular QTD into multiple MPS sized transactions. Thus it is possible to fill a QTD list with multiple bulk transfers, and have the entire list executed automatically (i.e., only interrupt on completion of the last QTD).\\n\\nControl\\n^^^^^^^\\n\\nControl transfers are more complicated as they are bi-directional (i.e., each control transfer stage can have a different direction). Thus, a separate QTD is required for each stage, and each QTD must halt the channel on completion. Halting the channel after each QTD allows changing the channel's direction to be changed by reconfiguring the channel's CSRs. Thus a typical control transfer consists of 3 QTDs (one for each stage).\\n\\nInterrupt\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn accordance with the USB2.0 specification, interrupt transfers executes transactions at the endpoints specified service period (i.e., ``bInterval``). A particular interrupt endpoint may not execute more than one interrupt transaction within a service period. The service period is specified in number of microframes/frames, thus a particular interrupt endpoint will generally execute one transaction every Nth microframe/frame until the transfer is complete. For interrupt channels, the service period of a particular channel (i.e., ``bInterval``) is specified via the Host Frame List (see section 6.5 of programming guide for more details).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  HS USB allows an interrupt endpoint to have 3 interrupt transactions in a single microframe. See USB2.0 specification section 5.7.3 (Interrupt Transfer Packet Size Constraints) for more details.\\n\\nThus, interrupt transfers in Host Mode Scatter/Gather DMA have the following peculiarities:\\n\\n- If a QTD payload is larger than the endpoint's MPS, the channel will automatically split the transfer into multiple MPS sized transactions (similar to bulk transfers). However, each transaction **is executed at endpoint's specified service period** (i.e., one transaction per ``bInterval``) until the transfer completes.\\n- For Interrupt IN transfers, if a short packet is received (i.e., transaction's data payload is < MPS), this indicates that the endpoint has no more data to send. In this case:\\n\\n  - the channel generates an extra channel interrupt even if the transfer's QTD did not set the IOC (interrupt on complete) bit.\\n  - however, the channel is not halted even if this extra channel interrupt is generated.\\n  - software must then use this extra interrupt to manually halt the interrupt channel (thus canceling any remaining QTDs in the QTD list).\\n\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  Due to the interrupt transfer peculiarities, it may be easier for software allocate a QTD for each transaction instead of an entire transfer.\\n\\nIsochronous\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn accordance with the USB2.0 specification, isochronous transfers executes transactions at the endpoints specified service period (i.e., ``bInterval``) in order to achieve a constant rate of data transfer. A particular isochronous endpoint may not execute more than one isochronous transaction within a service period. The service period is specified in number of microframes/frames, thus a particular isochronous endpoint will generally execute one transaction every Nth microframe/frame until the transfer is complete. For isochronous channels, the service period of a particular channel (i.e., ``bInterval``) is specified via the Host Frame List (see section 6.5 of programming guide for more details).\\n\\nHowever, unlike interrupt transactions, isochronous transactions are not retried on failure (or NAK), due to the need to maintain the constant data rate.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  HS USB allows an isochronous endpoint to have 3 interrupt transactions in a single microframe. See USB2.0 specification section 5.6.3 (Isochronous Transfer Packet Size Constraints) for more details.\\n\\nThus, isochronous transfers in Host Mode Scatter/Gather DMA have the following peculiarities:\\n\\n- A QTD must be allocated for each microframe/frame. However, non-service service period QTDs should be left blank (i.e., only ever Nth QTD should be filled if the channel's service period is every Nth microframe/frame).\\n- **Each filled QTD must represent a single transaction instead of a transfer**.\\n- Because isochronous transactions are not retried on failure, the status each completed QTD must be checked.\\n\\nSupplemental Notes\\n------------------\\n\\nSome of the DWC_OTG's behaviors are not mentioned in the Databook or Programming Guide. This section describes some of those behaviors that are relevant to the Host stack's implementation.\\n\\nPort Errors Do Not Trigger a Channel Interrupt\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf a port error occurs (such as a sudden disconnection or port over-current) while there are one or more active channels...\\n\\n- The active channels remains active (i.e., ``HCCHAR.ChEna`` remains set) and no channel interrupts are generated.\\n- Channels could in theory be disabled by setting ``HCCHAR.ChDis``, but this does not work for Isochronous channels as the channel disabled interrupt is never generated.\\n\\nTherefore, on port errors, a controller soft reset should be used to ensure all channels are disabled.\\n\\nPort Reset Interrupts\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- When the DWC_OTG issues a reset signal on its port, and during the reset signal the device disconnects, the disconnection interrupt (i.e., ``HPRT.PrtConnDet``) is not generated until the reset is deasserted.\\n- When resetting an already enabled port (i.e., ``HPRT.PrtEna``) such as a second reset during enumeration or a run-time reset, a Port Enable/Disable Change interrupt (i.e., ``HPRT.PrtEnChng``) is generated both on the assertion and deassertion of the reset signal.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Overriding Default Chip Drivers\\n===============================\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n   Customizing SPI Flash Chip Drivers is considered an \"expert\" feature. Users should only do so at their own risk. (See the notes below)\\n\\nDuring the SPI Flash driver\\'s initialization (i.e., :cpp:func:`esp_flash_init`), there is a chip detection step during which the driver iterates through a Default Chip Driver List and determine which chip driver can properly support the currently connected flash chip. The Default Chip Drivers are provided by the ESP-IDF, thus are updated in together with each ESP-IDF version. However ESP-IDF also allows users to customize their own chip drivers.\\n\\nUsers should note the following when customizing chip drivers:\\n\\n   1. You may need to rely on some non-public ESP-IDF functions, which have slight possibility to change between ESP-IDF versions. On the one hand, these changes may be useful bug fixes for your driver, on the other hand, they may also be breaking changes (i.e., breaks your code).\\n   2. Some ESP-IDF bug fixes to other chip drivers are not automatically applied to your own custom chip drivers.\\n   3. If the protection of flash is not handled properly, there may be some random reliability issues.\\n   4. If you update to a newer ESP-IDF version that has support for more chips, you will have to manually add those new chip drivers into your custom chip driver list. Otherwise the driver will only search for the drivers in custom list you provided.\\n\\n\\nSteps For Creating Custom Chip Drivers and Overriding the ESP-IDF Default Driver List\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n.. highlight: cmake\\n\\n1. Enable the :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_OVERRIDE_CHIP_DRIVER_LIST` config option. This prevents compilation and linking of the Default Chip Driver List (``default_registered_chips``) provided by ESP-IDF. Instead, the linker searches for the structure of the same name (``default_registered_chips``) that must be provided by the user.\\n2. Add a new component in your project, e.g., ``custom_chip_driver``.\\n3. Copy the necessary chip driver files from the ``spi_flash`` component in ESP-IDF. This may include:\\n\\n    - ``spi_flash_chip_drivers.c`` (to provide the ``default_registered_chips`` structure)\\n    - Any of the ``spi_flash_chip_*.c`` files that matches your own flash model best\\n    - ``CMakeLists.txt`` and ``linker.lf`` files\\n\\n   Modify the files above properly. Including:\\n\\n   - Change the ``default_registered_chips`` variable to non-static and remove the #ifdef logic around it.\\n   - Update ``linker.lf`` file to rename the fragment header and the library name to match the new component.\\n   - If reusing other drivers, some header names need prefixing with ``spi_flash/`` when included from outside spi_flash component.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   - When writing your own flash chip driver, you can set your flash chip capabilities through ``spi_flash_chip_***(vendor)_get_caps`` and points the function pointer ``get_chip_caps`` for protection to the ``spi_flash_chip_***_get_caps`` function. The steps are as follows.\\n\\n      1. Please check whether your flash chip have the capabilities listed in ``spi_flash_caps_t`` by checking the flash datasheet.\\n      2. Write a function named ``spi_flash_chip_***(vendor)_get_caps``. Take the example below as a reference. (if the flash support ``suspend`` and ``read unique id``).\\n      3. Points the pointer ``get_chip_caps`` (in ``spi_flash_chip_t``) to the function mentioned above.\\n\\n      .. code-block:: c\\n\\n         spi_flash_caps_t spi_flash_chip_***(vendor)_get_caps(esp_flash_t *chip)\\n         {\\n            spi_flash_caps_t caps_flags = 0;\\n            // 32-bit-address flash is not supported\\n            flash-suspend is supported\\n            caps_flags |= SPI_FLAHS_CHIP_CAP_SUSPEND;\\n            // flash read unique id.\\n            caps_flags |= SPI_FLASH_CHIP_CAP_UNIQUE_ID;\\n            return caps_flags;\\n         }\\n\\n      .. code-block:: c\\n\\n         const spi_flash_chip_t esp_flash_chip_eon = {\\n            // Other function pointers\\n            .get_chip_caps = spi_flash_chip_eon_get_caps,\\n         };\\n\\n   - You also can see how to implement this in the example :example:`storage/custom_flash_driver`.\\n\\n4. Write a new ``CMakeLists.txt`` file for the ``custom_chip_driver`` component, including an additional line to add a linker dependency from ``spi_flash`` to ``custom_chip_driver``::\\n\\n        idf_component_register(SRCS \"spi_flash_chip_drivers.c\"\\n                               \"spi_flash_chip_mychip.c\"  # modify as needed\\n                               REQUIRES hal\\n                               PRIV_REQUIRES spi_flash\\n                               LDFRAGMENTS linker.lf)\\n        idf_component_add_link_dependency(FROM spi_flash)\\n\\n   - An example of this component CMakeLists.txt can be found in :example_file:`storage/custom_flash_driver/components/custom_chip_driver/CMakeLists.txt`\\n\\n5. The ``linker.lf`` is used to put every chip driver that you are going to use whilst cache is disabled into internal RAM. See :doc:`/api-guides/linker-script-generation` for more details. Make sure this file covers all the source files that you add.\\n\\n6. Build your project, and you will see the new flash driver is used.\\n\\nExample\\n-------\\n\\nSee also :example:`storage/custom_flash_driver`.\\n',\n",
       " 'SPI Flash API\\n=============\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nThe spi_flash component contains API functions related to reading, writing, erasing, and memory mapping for data in the external flash.\\n\\nFor higher-level API functions which work with partitions defined in the :doc:`partition table </api-guides/partition-tables>`, see :doc:`/api-reference/storage/partition`\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    ``esp_partition_*`` APIs are recommended to be used instead of the lower level ``esp_flash_*`` API functions when accessing the main SPI flash chip, since they conduct bounds checking and are guaranteed to calculate correct offsets in flash based on the information in the partition table. ``esp_flash_*`` functions can still be used directly when accessing an external (secondary) SPI flash chip.\\n\\nDifferent from the API before ESP-IDF v4.0, the functionality of ``esp_flash_*`` APIs is not limited to the \"main\" SPI flash chip (the same SPI flash chip from which program runs). With different chip pointers, you can access external flash chips connected to not only SPI0/1 but also other SPI buses like SPI2.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Instead of going through the cache connected to the SPI0 peripheral, most ``esp_flash_*`` APIs go through other SPI peripherals like SPI1, SPI2, etc. This makes them able to access not only the main flash, but also external (secondary) flash.\\n\\n    However, due to the limitations of the cache, operations through the cache are limited to the main flash. The address range limitation for these operations is also on the cache side. The cache is not able to access external flash chips or address range above its capabilities. These cache operations include: mmap, encrypted read/write, executing code or access to variables in the flash.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Flash APIs after ESP-IDF v4.0 are no longer **atomic**. If a write operation occurs during another on-going read operation, and the flash addresses of both operations overlap, the data returned from the read operation may contain both old data and new data (that was updated written by the write operation).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Encrypted flash operations are only supported with the main flash chip (and not with other flash chips, that is on SPI1 with different CS, or on other SPI buses). Reading through cache is only supported on the main flash, which is determined by the HW.\\n\\nSupport for Features of Flash Chips\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nQuad/Dual Mode Chips\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFeatures of different flashes are implemented in different ways and thus need special support. The fast/slow read and Dual mode (DOUT/DIO) of almost all flashes with 24-bit address are supported, because they do not need any vendor-specific commands.\\n\\nQuad mode (QIO/QOUT) is supported on the following chip types:\\n\\n1. ISSI\\n2. GD\\n3. MXIC\\n4. FM\\n5. Winbond\\n6. XMC\\n7. BOYA\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Only when one flash series listed above is supported by {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, this flash series is supported by the chip driver by default. You can use ``Component config`` > ``SPI Flash driver`` > ``Auto-detect flash chips`` in menuconfig to enable/disable a flash series.\\n\\nOptional Features\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. toctree::\\n    :hidden:\\n\\n    spi_flash_optional_feature\\n\\nThere are some features that are not supported by all flash chips, or not supported by all Espressif chips. These features include:\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s3\\n\\n    -  OPI flash - means that flash supports octal mode.\\n\\n-  32-bit address flash - usually means that the flash has higher capacity (equal to or larger than 16 MB) that needs longer addresses.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s3\\n\\n    -  High performance mode (HPM) - means that flash works under high frequency which is higher than 80 MHz.\\n\\n-  Flash unique ID - means that flash supports its unique 64-bit ID.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPI_MEM_SUPPORT_AUTO_SUSPEND\\n\\n    -  Suspend & Resume - means that flash can accept suspend/resume command during its writing/erasing. The {IDF_TARGET_NAME} may keep the cache on when the flash is being written/erased and suspend it to read its contents randomly.\\n\\nIf you want to use these features, please ensure both {IDF_TARGET_NAME} and ALL flash chips in your product support these features. For more details, refer to :doc:`spi_flash_optional_feature`.\\n\\nYou may also customise your own flash chip driver. See :doc:`spi_flash_override_driver` for more details.\\n\\n.. toctree::\\n   :hidden:\\n\\n   Custom Flash Driver <spi_flash_override_driver>\\n\\nInitializing a Flash Device\\n---------------------------\\n\\nTo use the ``esp_flash_*`` APIs, you need to initialise a flash chip on a certain SPI bus, as shown below:\\n\\n1. Call :cpp:func:`spi_bus_initialize` to properly initialize an SPI bus. This function initializes the resources (I/O, DMA, interrupts) shared among devices attached to this bus.\\n\\n2. Call :cpp:func:`spi_bus_add_flash_device` to attach the flash device to the bus. This function allocates memory and fills the members for the ``esp_flash_t`` structure. The CS I/O is also initialized here.\\n\\n3. Call :cpp:func:`esp_flash_init` to actually communicate with the chip. This also detects the chip type, and influence the following operations.\\n\\n.. note:: Multiple flash chips can be attached to the same bus now.\\n\\nSPI Flash Access API\\n--------------------\\n\\nThis is the set of API functions for working with data in flash:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_flash_read` reads data from flash to RAM\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_flash_write` writes data from RAM to flash\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_flash_erase_region` erases specific region of flash\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_flash_erase_chip` erases the whole flash\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_flash_get_chip_size` returns flash chip size, in bytes, as configured in menuconfig\\n\\nGenerally, try to avoid using the raw SPI flash functions to the \"main\" SPI flash chip in favour of :ref:`partition-specific functions <flash-partition-apis>`.\\n\\nSPI Flash Size\\n--------------\\n\\nThe SPI flash size is configured by writing a field in the software bootloader image header, flashed at offset 0x1000.\\n\\nBy default, the SPI flash size is detected by ``esptool.py`` when this bootloader is written to flash, and the header is updated with the correct size. Alternatively, it is possible to generate a fixed flash size by setting :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE` in the project configuration.\\n\\nIf it is necessary to override the configured flash size at runtime, it is possible to set the ``chip_size`` member of the ``g_rom_flashchip`` structure. This size is used by ``esp_flash_*`` functions (in both software & ROM) to check the bounds.\\n\\nConcurrency Constraints for Flash on SPI1\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\n.. toctree::\\n    :hidden:\\n\\n    spi_flash_concurrency\\n\\n.. attention::\\n\\n   The SPI0/1 bus is shared between the instruction & data cache (for firmware execution) and the SPI1 peripheral (controlled by the drivers including this SPI flash driver). Hence, calling SPI Flash API on SPI1 bus (including the main flash) causes significant influence to the whole system. See :doc:`spi_flash_concurrency` for more details.\\n\\n\\nSPI Flash Encryption\\n--------------------\\n\\nIt is possible to encrypt the contents of SPI flash and have it transparently decrypted by hardware.\\n\\nRefer to the :doc:`Flash Encryption documentation </security/flash-encryption>` for more details.\\n\\nMemory Mapping API\\n------------------\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_CACHE_SIZE:default=\"64 KB\", esp32c2=16 ~ 64 KB}\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} features memory hardware which allows regions of flash memory to be mapped into instruction and data address spaces. This mapping works only for read operations. It is not possible to modify contents of flash memory by writing to a mapped memory region.\\n\\nMapping happens in {IDF_TARGET_CACHE_SIZE} pages. Memory mapping hardware can map flash into the data address space and the instruction address space. See the technical reference manual for more details and limitations about memory mapping hardware.\\n\\nNote that some pages are used to map the application itself into memory, so the actual number of available pages may be less than the capability of the hardware.\\n\\nReading data from flash using a memory mapped region is the only way to decrypt contents of flash when :doc:`flash encryption </security/flash-encryption>` is enabled. Decryption is performed at the hardware level.\\n\\nMemory mapping API are declared in ``spi_flash_mmap.h`` and ``esp_partition.h``:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`spi_flash_mmap` maps a region of physical flash addresses into instruction space or data space of the CPU.\\n- :cpp:func:`spi_flash_munmap` unmaps previously mapped region.\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_partition_mmap` maps part of a partition into the instruction space or data space of the CPU.\\n\\nDifferences between :cpp:func:`spi_flash_mmap` and :cpp:func:`esp_partition_mmap` are as follows:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`spi_flash_mmap` must be given a {IDF_TARGET_CACHE_SIZE} aligned physical address.\\n- :cpp:func:`esp_partition_mmap` may be given any arbitrary offset within the partition. It adjusts the returned pointer to mapped memory as necessary.\\n\\nNote that since memory mapping happens in pages, it may be possible to read data outside of the partition provided to ``esp_partition_mmap``, regardless of the partition boundary.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    mmap is supported by cache, so it can only be used on main flash.\\n\\nSPI Flash Implementation\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe ``esp_flash_t`` structure holds chip data as well as three important parts of this API:\\n\\n1. The host driver, which provides the hardware support to access the chip;\\n2. The chip driver, which provides compatibility service to different chips;\\n3. The OS functions, provide support of some OS functions (e.g., lock, delay) in different stages (1st/2nd boot, or the app).\\n\\nHost Driver\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe host driver relies on an interface (``spi_flash_host_driver_t``) defined in the ``spi_flash_types.h`` (in the ``hal/include/hal`` folder). This interface provides some common functions to communicate with the chip.\\n\\nIn other files of the SPI HAL, some of these functions are implemented with existing {IDF_TARGET_NAME} memory-spi functionalities. However, due to the speed limitations of {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, the HAL layer cannot provide high-speed implementations to some reading commands (so the support for it was dropped). The files (``memspi_host_driver.h`` and ``.c``) implement the high-speed version of these commands with the ``common_command`` function provided in the HAL, and wrap these functions as ``spi_flash_host_driver_t`` for upper layer to use.\\n\\nYou can also implement your own host driver, even with the GPIO. As long as all the functions in the ``spi_flash_host_driver_t`` are implemented, the esp_flash API can access the flash regardless of the low-level hardware.\\n\\nChip Driver\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe chip driver, defined in ``spi_flash_chip_driver.h``, wraps basic functions provided by the host driver for the API layer to use.\\n\\nSome operations need some commands to be sent first, or read some status afterwards. Some chips need different commands or values, or need special communication ways.\\n\\nThere is a type of chip called ``generic chip`` which stands for common chips. Other special chip drivers can be developed on the base of the generic chip.\\n\\nThe chip driver relies on the host driver.\\n\\n.. _esp_flash_os_func:\\n\\nOS Functions\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nCurrently the OS function layer provides entries of a lock and delay.\\n\\nThe lock (see :ref:`spi_bus_lock`) is used to resolve the conflicts among the access of devices on the same SPI bus, and the SPI Flash chip access. E.g.\\n\\n1. On SPI1 bus, the cache (used to fetch the data (code) in the Flash and PSRAM) should be disabled when the flash chip on the SPI0/1 is being accessed.\\n\\n2. On the other buses, the flash driver needs to disable the ISR registered by SPI Master driver, to avoid conflicts.\\n\\n3. Some devices of SPI Master driver may require to use the bus monopolized during a period (especially when the device does not have a CS wire, or the wire is controlled by software like SDSPI driver).\\n\\nThe delay is used by some long operations which requires the master to wait or polling periodically.\\n\\nThe top API wraps these the chip driver and OS functions into an entire component, and also provides some argument checking.\\n\\nOS functions can also help to avoid a watchdog timeout when erasing large flash areas. During this time, the CPU is occupied with the flash erasing task. This stops other tasks from being executed. Among these tasks is the idle task to feed the watchdog timer (WDT). If the configuration option :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_PANIC` is selected and the flash operation time is longer than the watchdog timeout period, the system will reboot.\\n\\nIt is pretty hard to totally eliminate this risk, because the erasing time varies with different flash chips, making it hard to be compatible in flash drivers. Therefore, users need to pay attention to it. Please use the following guidelines:\\n\\n1. It is recommended to enable the :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_YIELD_DURING_ERASE` option to allow the scheduler to re-schedule during erasing flash memory. Besides, following parameters can also be used.\\n\\n- Increase :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_ERASE_YIELD_TICKS` or decrease :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_ERASE_YIELD_DURATION_MS` in menuconfig.\\n- You can also increase :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_TIMEOUT_S` in menuconfig for a larger watchdog timeout period. However, with larger watchdog timeout period, previously detected timeouts may no longer be detected.\\n\\n2. Please be aware of the consequences of enabling the :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_PANIC` option when doing long-running SPI flash operations which triggers the panic handler when it times out. However, this option can also help dealing with unexpected exceptions in your application. Please decide whether this is needed to be enabled according to actual condition.\\n\\n3. During your development, please carefully review the actual flash operation according to the specific requirements and time limits on erasing flash memory of your projects. Always allow reasonable redundancy based on your specific product requirements when configuring the flash erasing timeout threshold, thus improving the reliability of your product.\\n\\n.. _spi-flash-implementation-details:\\n\\nImplementation Details\\n----------------------\\n\\nIn order to perform some flash operations, it is necessary to make sure that both CPUs are not running any code from flash for the duration of the flash operation:\\n\\n- In a single-core setup, the SDK needs to disable interrupts or scheduler before performing the flash operation.\\n- In a dual-core setup, the SDK needs to make sure that both CPUs are not running any code from flash.\\n\\nWhen SPI flash API is called on CPU A (can be PRO or APP), start the ``spi_flash_op_block_func`` function on CPU B using the ``esp_ipc_call`` API. This API wakes up a high priority task on CPU B and tells it to execute a given function, in this case, ``spi_flash_op_block_func``. This function disables cache on CPU B and signals that the cache is disabled by setting the ``s_flash_op_can_start`` flag. Then the task on CPU A disables cache as well and proceeds to execute flash operation.\\n\\nWhile a flash operation is running, interrupts can still run on CPUs A and B. It is assumed that all interrupt code is placed into RAM. Once the interrupt allocation API is added, a flag should be added to request the interrupt to be disabled for the duration of a flash operations.\\n\\nOnce the flash operation is complete, the function on CPU A sets another flag, ``s_flash_op_complete``, to let the task on CPU B know that it can re-enable cache and release the CPU.

You can check the list below for more information.\\n\\n-  `Auto Suspend & Resume <#auto-suspend-&-resume>`__\\n\\n-  `Flash unique ID <#flash-unique-id>`__\\n\\n-  `High Performance Mode of QSPI Flash Chips <#high-performance-mode>`__\\n\\n-  `32-bit Address Support of QSPI Flash Chips <#32-bit-address-flash-chips>`__\\n\\n-  `OPI Flash Support <#opi-flash-support>`__\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    When Flash optional features listed in this page are used, aside from the capability of ESP chips, and ESP-IDF verison you are using, you will also need to make sure these features are supported by flash chips used.\\n\\n    - If you are using an official Espressif modules/SiP. Some of the modules/SiPs always support the feature, in this case you can see these features listed in the datasheet. Otherwise please contact `Espressif's business team <https://www.espressif.com/en/contact-us/sales-questions>`_ to know if we can supply such products for you.\\n\\n    - If you are making your own modules with your own bought flash chips, and you need features listed above. Please contact your vendor if they support the those features, and make sure that the chips can be supplied continuously.\\n\\n.. attention::\\n\\n    This document only shows that ESP-IDF code has supported the features of those flash chips. It is not a list of stable flash chips certified by Espressif. If you build your own hardware from flash chips with your own brought flash chips (even with flash listed in this page), you need to validate the reliability of flash chips yourself.\\n\\n.. _auto-suspend-intro:\\n\\nAuto Suspend & Resume\\n---------------------\\n\\nThis feature is only supported on ESP32-S3, ESP32-C2, ESP32-C3, ESP32-C6, ESP32-H2 for now.\\n\\nThe support for ESP32-P4 may be added in the future.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPI_MEM_SUPPORT_AUTO_SUSPEND\\n\\n    List of Flash chips that support this feature:\\n\\n    1. XM25QxxC series.\\n    2. GD25QxxE series.\\n    3. FM25Q32\\n\\n    .. attention::\\n\\n        There are multiple limitations about the auto-suspend feature, please do read :ref:`auto-suspend` for more information before you enable this feature.\\n\\n\\nFlash Unique ID\\n---------------\\n\\nThis feature is supported on all Espressif chips.\\n\\nUnique ID is not flash id, which means flash has 64-Bit unique ID for each device. The instruction to read the unique ID (4Bh) accesses a factory-set read-only 64-bit number that is unique to each flash device. This ID number helps you to recognize each single device. Not all flash vendors support this feature. If you try to read the unique ID on a chip which does not have this feature, the behavior is not determined. The support list is as follows.\\n\\n\\nList of Flash chips that support this feature:\\n\\n1. ISSI\\n2. GD\\n3. TH\\n4. FM\\n5. Winbond\\n6. XMC\\n7. BOYA\\n\\n.. _hpm-doc:\\n\\nHigh Performance Mode of QSPI Flash Chips\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nThis featuer is only supported on ESP32-S3 for now.\\n\\nThe support for ESP32-S2, ESP32-C3, ESP32-C6, ESP32-H2, ESP32-P4 may be added in the future.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    This section is provided for QSPI flash chips. Octal flash used on ESP-chips support High performance mode by default so far, please refer to the :ref:`oct-flash-doc` for the list of supported octal flash chips.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s3\\n\\n    High performance mode (HPM) means that the SPI1 and flash chip works under high frequency. Usually, when the operating frequency of the flash is greater than 80 MHz, it is considered that the flash works under HPM.\\n\\n    As far as we acknowledged, there are more than three strategies for High Performance Mode (HPM) in typical SPI flash parts. For some flash chips, HPM is controlled by dummy cycle bit in the registers, while for other chips, it can be controlled by other bits (like HPM bit) in the register, or some special command. The difference in strategies requires the driver to explicitly add support for each chip.\\n\\n    .. attention::\\n\\n        It is hard to create several strategies to cover all situations, so all flash chips using HPM need to be supported explicitly. Therefore, if you try to use a flash not listed in :ref:`hpm_dc_support_list`, it might cause some error. So, when you try to use the flash chip beyond supported list, please test properly.\\n\\n    Moreover, when the `Dummy Cycle adjustment` strategy is adopted by the flash chip, the flash remains in a state in which DC is different from the default value after a software reset. The sub mode of HPM that adjusts the dummy cycle to run at higher frequency in the application is called `HPM-DC`. `HPM-DC` feature needs a feature `DC Aware` to be enabled in the bootloader. Otherwise different DC value will forbid the 2nd bootloader from being boot up after reset.\\n\\n    To enable High Performance Mode:\\n\\n    1. De-select :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_OCT_FLASH` and :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASH_MODE_AUTO_DETECT`. HPM is not used for Octal flash, enabling related options may bypass HPM functions.\\n\\n    2. Enable ``CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_HPM_ENA`` option.\\n\\n    3. Switch Flash frequency to HPM ones. For example, ``CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHFREQ_120M``.\\n\\n    4. Make sure the config option for `HPM-DC` feature (under ``CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_HPM_DC`` choices) is selected correctly according to whether the bootloader supports `DC Aware`.\\n\\n        - If bootloader supports `DC Aware`, select ``CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_HPM_DC_AUTO``. This allows the usage of flash chips that adopted `Dummy Cycle adjustment` strategy.\\n\\n        - If bootloader doesn't support `DC Aware`, select ``CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_HPM_DC_DISABLE``. It avoid consequences caused by running HPM-DC with non-DC-aware bootloaders. But please avoid using flash chips that adopts `Dummy Cycle adjustment` strategy if ``CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_HPM_DC_DISABLE`` is selected. See list of flash models that adpot DC strategy below.\\n\\n    Check whether the bootloader supports `DC Aware` in the following way:\\n\\n    - If you are starting a new project, it's suggested to enable `DC Aware` by selecting :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_FLASH_DC_AWARE` option in the bootloader menu. Please note that, you won't be able to modify this option via OTA, because the support is in the bootloader.\\n\\n    - If you are working on an existing project and want to update `HPM-DC` config option in the app via OTA, check the sdkconfig file used to build your bootloader: (Upgrading ESP-IDF version may make this file different from the one used by bootloader to build.)\\n\\n        - For latest version (ESP-IDF v5.2 and above), if :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_FLASH_DC_AWARE` is selected, the bootloader supports `DC Aware`.\\n\\n        - For versions in this range: (v4.4.4+, v5.0+, and v5.1+), if ``CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHFREQ_120M`` is selected, the bootloader supports `DC Aware`. In this case, enable :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_FLASH_DC_AWARE` to confirm this (though it will not affect bootloader in devices in the field).\\n\\n        - For versions below v4.4.4, the bootloader doesn't support `DC Aware`.\\n\\n    .. _hpm_dc_support_list:\\n\\n    Quad Flash HPM support list\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Flash chips that don't need HPM-DC:\\n\\n    1.

The 32-bit address support of Octal Flash chips are considered as part of the Octal flash support. Please refer to the :ref:`oct-flash-doc` for the list of supported octal flash chips.\\n\\nMost NOR flash chips used by Espressif chips use 24-bits address, which can cover 16 MBytes memory. However, for larger memory (usually equal to or larger than 32 MBytes), flash uses a 32-bits address to address memory region higher than 16 MBytes. Unfortunately, 32-bits address chips have vendor-specific commands, so we need to support the chips one by one.\\n\\nList of Flash chips that support this feature:\\n\\n1. W25Q256\\n2.

       " '.. _concurrency-constraints-flash:\\n\\nConcurrency Constraints for Flash on SPI1\\n=========================================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThe SPI0/1 bus is shared between the instruction & data cache (for firmware execution) and the SPI1 peripheral (controlled by the drivers including this SPI Flash driver). Hence, operations to SPI1 will cause significant influence to the whole system. This kind of operations include calling SPI Flash API or other drivers on SPI1 bus, any operations like read/write/erase or other user defined SPI operations, regardless to the main flash or other SPI slave devices.\\n\\n.. only:: not (esp32c3 or SOC_SPIRAM_XIP_SUPPORTED)\\n\\n    On {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, these caches must be disabled while reading/writing/erasing.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPI_MEM_SUPPORT_AUTO_SUSPEND\\n\\n    On {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, the config option :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_AUTO_SUSPEND` (enabled by default) allows the cache to read flash concurrently with SPI1 operations. See :ref:`auto-suspend` for more details.\\n\\n    If this option is disabled, the caches must be disabled while reading/writing/erasing operations. There are some constraints using driver on the SPI1 bus, see :ref:`impact_disabled_cache`. These constraints will cause more IRAM/DRAM usages.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPIRAM_XIP_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    On {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, the config options :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_FETCH_INSTRUCTIONS` (disabled by default) and :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_RODATA` (disabled by default) allow the cache to read/write PSRAM concurrently with SPI1 operations. See :ref:`xip_from_psram` for more details.\\n\\n    If these options are disabled, the caches must be disabled while reading/writing/erasing operations. There are some constraints using driver on the SPI1 bus, see :ref:`impact_disabled_cache`. These constraints will cause more IRAM/DRAM usages.\\n\\n.. _impact_disabled_cache:\\n\\nWhen the Caches Are Disabled\\n----------------------------\\n\\nUnder this condition, all CPUs should always execute code and access data from internal RAM. The APIs documented in this file will disable the caches automatically and transparently.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c3\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        When :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_AUTO_SUSPEND` is enabled, these APIs will not disable the caches. The hardware will handle the arbitration between them.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPIRAM_XIP_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        When :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_FETCH_INSTRUCTIONS` and :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_RODATA` are both enabled, these APIs will not disable the caches.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES\\n\\n    The way that these APIs disable the caches suspends all the other tasks. Besides, all non-IRAM-safe interrupts will be disabled. The other core will be polling in a busy loop. These will be restored until the Flash operation completes.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES\\n\\n    The way that these APIs disable the caches also disables non-IRAM-safe interrupts. These will be restored until the Flash operation completes.\\n\\nSee also :ref:`esp_flash_os_func` and :ref:`spi_bus_lock`.\\n\\nThere are no such constraints and impacts for flash chips on other SPI buses than SPI0/1.\\n\\nFor differences between internal RAM (e.g., IRAM, DRAM) and flash cache, please refer to the :ref:`application memory layout <memory-layout>` documentation.\\n\\n\\n.. _iram-safe-interrupt-handlers:\\n\\nIRAM-Safe Interrupt Handlers\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFor interrupt handlers which need to execute when the cache is disabled (e.g., for low latency operations), set the ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_IRAM`` flag when the :doc:`interrupt handler is registered </api-reference/system/intr_alloc>`.\\n\\nYou must ensure that all data and functions accessed by these interrupt handlers, including the ones that handlers call, are located in IRAM or DRAM. See :ref:`how-to-place-code-in-iram`.\\n\\nIf a function or symbol is not correctly put into IRAM/DRAM, and the interrupt handler reads from the flash cache during a flash operation, it will cause a crash due to Illegal Instruction exception (for code which should be in IRAM) or garbage data to be read (for constant data which should be in DRAM).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    When working with strings in ISRs, it is not advised to use ``printf`` and other output functions. For debugging purposes, use :cpp:func:`ESP_DRAM_LOGE` and similar macros when logging from ISRs. Make sure that both ``TAG`` and format string are placed into ``DRAM`` in that case.\\n\\nNon-IRAM-Safe Interrupt Handlers\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf the ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_IRAM`` flag is not set when registering, the interrupt handler will not get executed when the caches are disabled. Once the caches are restored, the non-IRAM-safe interrupts will be re-enabled. After this moment, the interrupt handler will run normally again.

This could be used, e.g., for testing or in trusted environments where you prefer speed over security.\\n\\nPerformance\\n-----------\\n\\nThe initial session setup can take about two seconds, or more with slower clock speed or more verbose logging. Subsequent requests through the open secure socket are much faster (down to under 100 ms).\\n\\nEvent Handling\\n--------------\\n\\nESP HTTPS Server has various events for which a handler can be triggered by :doc:`the Event Loop library <../system/esp_event>` when the particular event occurs. The handler has to be registered using :cpp:func:`esp_event_handler_register`.

It supports common scenarios like CA certification validation, SNI, ALPN negotiation, and non-blocking connection among others. All the configurations can be specified in the ``esp_tls_cfg_t`` data structure. Once done, TLS communication can be conducted using the following APIs:\\n\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_tls_init`: for initializing the TLS connection handle.\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_tls_conn_new_sync`: for opening a new blocking TLS connection.\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_tls_conn_new_async`: for opening a new non-blocking TLS connection.\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_tls_conn_read`: for reading from the connection.\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_tls_conn_write`: for writing into the connection.\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_tls_conn_destroy`: for freeing up the connection.\\n\\nAny application layer protocol like HTTP1, HTTP2, etc can be executed on top of this layer.\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\nSimple HTTPS example that uses ESP-TLS to establish a secure socket connection: :example:`protocols/https_request`.\\n\\nTree Structure for ESP-TLS Component\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\n    .. code-block:: none\\n\\n        ├── esp_tls.c\\n        ├── esp_tls.h\\n        ├── esp_tls_mbedtls.c\\n        ├── esp_tls_wolfssl.c\\n        └── private_include\\n            ├── esp_tls_mbedtls.h\\n            └── esp_tls_wolfssl.h\\n\\nThe ESP-TLS component has a file :component_file:`esp-tls/esp_tls.h` which contains the public API headers for the component. Internally, the ESP-TLS component operates using either MbedTLS or WolfSSL, which are SSL/TLS libraries. APIs specific to MbedTLS are present in :component_file:`esp-tls/private_include/esp_tls_mbedtls.h` and APIs specific to WolfSSL are present in :component_file:`esp-tls/private_include/esp_tls_wolfssl.h`.\\n\\n.. _esp_tls_server_verification:\\n\\nTLS Server Verification\\n-----------------------\\n\\nESP-TLS provides multiple options for TLS server verification on the client side. The ESP-TLS client can verify the server by validating the peer\\'s server certificate or with the help of pre-shared keys. The user should select only one of the following options in the :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure for TLS server verification. If no option is selected, the client will return a fatal error by default during the TLS connection setup.\\n\\n    *  **cacert_buf** and **cacert_bytes**: The CA certificate can be provided in a buffer to the :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure. The ESP-TLS uses the CA certificate present in the buffer to verify the server. The following variables in the :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure must be set.\\n\\n        * ``cacert_buf`` - pointer to the buffer which contains the CA certification.\\n        * ``cacert_bytes`` - the size of the CA certificate in bytes.\\n    * **use_global_ca_store**: The ``global_ca_store`` can be initialized and set at once. Then it can be used to verify the server for all the ESP-TLS connections which have set ``use_global_ca_store = true`` in their respective :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure. See the API Reference section below for information regarding different APIs used for initializing and setting up the ``global_ca_store``.\\n    * **crt_bundle_attach**: The ESP x509 Certificate Bundle API provides an easy way to include a bundle of custom x509 root certificates for TLS server verification. More details can be found at :doc:`ESP x509 Certificate Bundle </api-reference/protocols/esp_crt_bundle>`.\\n    * **psk_hint_key**: To use pre-shared keys for server verification, :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TLS_PSK_VERIFICATION` should be enabled in the ESP-TLS menuconfig. Then the pointer to the PSK hint and key should be provided to the :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure. The ESP-TLS will use the PSK for server verification only when no other option regarding server verification is selected.\\n    * **skip server verification**: This is an insecure option provided in the ESP-TLS for testing purposes. The option can be set by enabling :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TLS_INSECURE` and :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TLS_SKIP_SERVER_CERT_VERIFY` in the ESP-TLS menuconfig. When this option is enabled the ESP-TLS will skip server verification by default when no other options for server verification are selected in the :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure.\\n\\n    .. warning::\\n\\n        Enabling this option comes with a potential risk of establishing a TLS connection with a server that has a fake identity, provided that the server certificate is not provided either through API or other mechanisms like ca_store etc.\\n\\nESP-TLS Server Cert Selection Hook\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nThe ESP-TLS component provides an option to set the server certification selection hook when using the MbedTLS stack. This provides an ability to configure and use a certificate selection callback during server handshake. The callback helps to select a certificate to present to the client based on the TLS extensions supplied in the client hello message, such as ALPN and SNI. To enable this feature, please enable  :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TLS_SERVER_CERT_SELECT_HOOK` in the ESP-TLS menuconfig.\\n\\nThe certificate selection callback can be configured in the :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure as follows:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    int cert_selection_callback(mbedtls_ssl_context *ssl)\\n    {\\n        /* Code that the callback should execute */\\n        return 0;\\n    }\\n\\n    esp_tls_cfg_t cfg = {\\n        cert_select_cb = cert_section_callback,\\n    };\\n\\n.. _esp_tls_wolfssl:\\n\\nUnderlying SSL/TLS Library Options\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nThe ESP-TLS component offers the option to use MbedTLS or WolfSSL as its underlying SSL/TLS library. By default, only MbedTLS is available and used, WolfSSL SSL/TLS library is also available publicly at https://github.com/espressif/esp-wolfssl. The repository provides the WolfSSL component in binary format, and it also provides a few examples that are useful for understanding the API. Please refer to the repository ``README.md`` for information on licensing and other options. Please see the below section for instructions on how to use WolfSSL in your project.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    As the library options are internal to ESP-TLS, switching the libraries will not change ESP-TLS specific code for a project.\\n\\nHow to Use WolfSSL with ESP-IDF\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nThere are two ways to use WolfSSL in your project:\\n\\n1) Directly add WolfSSL as a component in your project with the following three commands::\\n\\n    (First, change the directory (cd) to your project directory)\\n    mkdir components\\n    cd components\\n    git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-wolfssl.git\\n\\n2) Add WolfSSL as an extra component in your project.\\n\\n* Download WolfSSL with::\\n\\n    git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-wolfssl.git\\n\\n* Include ESP-WolfSSL in ESP-IDF with setting ``EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS`` in ``CMakeLists.txt`` of your project as done in `wolfssl/examples <https://github.com/espressif/esp-wolfssl/tree/master/examples>`_. For reference see :ref:`optional_project_variable` in :doc:`build-system.</api-guides/build-system>`.\\n\\nAfter the above steps, you will have the option to choose WolfSSL as the underlying SSL/TLS library in the configuration menu of your project as follows::\\n\\n    idf.py menuconfig > ESP-TLS > SSL/TLS Library > Mbedtls/Wolfssl\\n\\nComparison Between MbedTLS and WolfSSL\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nThe following table shows a typical comparison between WolfSSL and MbedTLS when the :example:`protocols/https_request` example (which includes server authentication) is running with both SSL/TLS libraries and with all respective configurations set to default. For MbedTLS, the IN_CONTENT length and OUT_CONTENT length are set to 16384 bytes and 4096 bytes respectively.\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n    :widths: 40 30 30\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    * - Property\\n      - WolfSSL\\n      - MbedTLS\\n    * - Total Heap Consumed\\n      - ~ 19 KB\\n      - ~ 37 KB\\n    * - Task Stack Used\\n      - ~ 2.2 KB\\n      - ~ 3.6 KB\\n    * - Bin size\\n      - ~ 858 KB\\n      - ~ 736 KB\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    These values can vary based on configuration options and version of respective libraries.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    ATECC608A (Secure Element) with ESP-TLS\\n    --------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    ESP-TLS provides support for using ATECC608A cryptoauth chip with ESP32 series of SoCs. The use of ATECC608A is supported only when ESP-TLS is used with MbedTLS as its underlying SSL/TLS stack. ESP-TLS uses MbedTLS as its underlying TLS/SSL stack by default unless changed manually.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        ATECC608A chip interfaced to ESP32 must be already configured. For details, please refer to `esp_cryptoauth_utility <https://github.com/espressif/esp-cryptoauthlib/blob/master/esp_cryptoauth_utility/README.md#esp_cryptoauth_utility>`_.\\n\\n    To enable the secure element support, and use it in your project for TLS connection, you have to follow the below steps:\\n\\n    1) Add `esp-cryptoauthlib <https://github.com/espressif/esp-cryptoauthlib>`_ in your project, for details please refer `how to use esp-cryptoauthlib with ESP-IDF <https://github.com/espressif/esp-cryptoauthlib#how-to-use-esp-cryptoauthlib-with-esp-idf>`_.\\n\\n    2) Enable the following menuconfig option::\\n\\n        menuconfig > Component config > ESP-TLS > Use Secure Element (ATECC608A) with ESP-TLS\\n\\n    3) Select type of ATECC608A chip with following option::\\n\\n        menuconfig > Component config > esp-cryptoauthlib > Choose Type of ATECC608A chip\\n\\n    To know more about different types of ATECC608A chips and how to obtain the type of ATECC608A connected to your ESP module, please visit `ATECC608A chip type <https://github.com/espressif/esp-cryptoauthlib/blob/master/esp_cryptoauth_utility/README.md#find-type-of-atecc608a-chip-connected-to-esp32-wroom32-se>`_.\\n\\n    4) Enable the use of ATECC608A in ESP-TLS by providing the following config option in :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t`.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n            esp_tls_cfg_t cfg = {\\n                /* other configurations options */\\n                .use_secure_element = true,\\n            };\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_DIG_SIGN_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    .. _digital-signature-with-esp-tls:\\n\\n    Digital Signature with ESP-TLS\\n    ------------------------------\\n\\n    ESP-TLS provides support for using the Digital Signature (DS) with {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. Use of the DS for TLS is supported only when ESP-TLS is used with MbedTLS (default stack) as its underlying SSL/TLS stack. For more details on Digital Signature, please refer to the :doc:`Digital Signature (DS) </api-reference/peripherals/ds>`. The technical details of Digital Signature such as how to calculate private key parameters can be found in **{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual** > **Digital Signature (DS)** [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#digsig>`__]. The DS peripheral must be configured before it can be used to perform Digital Signature, see :ref:`configure-the-ds-peripheral`.\\n\\n    The DS peripheral must be initialized with the required encrypted private key parameters, which are obtained when the DS peripheral is configured. ESP-TLS internally initializes the DS peripheral when provided with the required DS context, i.e., DS parameters. Please see the below code snippet for passing the DS context to the ESP-TLS context. The DS context passed to the ESP-TLS context should not be freed till the TLS connection is deleted.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n            #include \"esp_tls.h\"\\n            esp_ds_data_ctx_t *ds_ctx;\\n            /* initialize ds_ctx with encrypted private key parameters, which can be read from the nvs or provided through the application code */\\n            esp_tls_cfg_t cfg = {\\n                .clientcert_buf = /* the client certification */,\\n                .clientcert_bytes = /* length of the client certification */,\\n                /* other configurations options */\\n                .ds_data = (void *)ds_ctx,\\n            };\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        When using Digital Signature for the TLS connection, along with the other required params, only the client certification (`clientcert_buf`) and the DS params (`ds_data`) are required and the client key (`clientkey_buf`) can be set to NULL.\\n\\n    * An example of mutual authentication with the DS peripheral can be found at :example:`ssl mutual auth<protocols/mqtt/ssl_mutual_auth>` which internally uses (ESP-TLS) for the TLS connection.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_ECDSA_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    .. _ecdsa-peri-with-esp-tls:\\n\\n    ECDSA Peripheral with ESP-TLS\\n    -----------------------------\\n\\n    ESP-TLS provides support for using the ECDSA peripheral with {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. The use of ECDSA peripheral is supported only when ESP-TLS is used with MbedTLS as its underlying SSL/TLS stack. The ECDSA private key should be present in the eFuse for using the ECDSA peripheral. Please refer to `espefuse.py <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/espefuse/index.html>`__ documentation for programming the ECDSA key in the efuse.\\n    To use ECDSA peripheral with ESP-TLS, set :cpp:member:`esp_tls_cfg_t::use_ecdsa_peripheral` to `true`, and set :cpp:member:`esp_tls_cfg_t::ecdsa_key_efuse_blk` to the eFuse block ID in which ECDSA private key is stored.\\n    This will enable the use of ECDSA peripheral for private key operations. As the client private key is already present in the eFuse, it needs not be supplied to the :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        #include \"esp_tls.h\"\\n        esp_tls_cfg_t cfg = {\\n            .use_ecdsa_peripheral = true,\\n            .ecdsa_key_efuse_blk = /* efuse block with ecdsa private key */,\\n        };\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        When using ECDSA peripheral with TLS, only ``MBEDTLS_TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`` ciphersuite is supported. If using TLS v1.3, ``MBEDTLS_TLS1_3_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`` ciphersuite is supported.\\n\\n\\nTLS Ciphersuites\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nESP-TLS provides the ability to set a ciphersuites list in client mode. The TLS ciphersuites list informs the server about the supported ciphersuites for the specific TLS connection regardless of the TLS stack configuration. If the server supports any ciphersuite from this list, then the TLS connection will succeed; otherwise, it will fail.\\n\\nYou can set ``ciphersuites_list`` in the :cpp:type:`esp_tls_cfg_t` structure during client connection as follows:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    /* ciphersuites_list must end with 0 and must be available in the memory scope active during the entire TLS connection */\\n    static const int ciphersuites_list[] = {MBEDTLS_TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, MBEDTLS_TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, 0};\\n    esp_tls_cfg_t cfg = {\\n        .ciphersuites_list = ciphersuites_list,\\n    };\\n\\nESP-TLS will not check the validity of ``ciphersuites_list`` that was set, you should call :cpp:func:`esp_tls_get_ciphersuites_list` to get ciphersuites list supported in the TLS stack and cross-check it against the supplied list.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   This feature is supported only in the MbedTLS stack.\\n\\nTLS Protocol Version\\n--------------------\\n\\nESP-TLS provides the ability to set the TLS protocol version for the respective TLS connection. Once the version is specified, it should be exclusively used to establish the TLS connection. This provides an ability to route different TLS connections to different protocol versions like TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 at runtime.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   At the moment, the feature is supported only when ESP-TLS is used with MbedTLS as its underlying SSL/TLS stack.\\n\\nTo set TLS protocol version with ESP-TLS, set :cpp:member:`esp_tls_cfg_t::tls_version` to the required protocol version from :cpp:type:`esp_tls_proto_ver_t`. If the protocol version field is not set, then the default policy is to allow TLS connection based on the server requirement.\\n\\nThe ESP-TLS connection can be configured to use the specified protocol version as follows:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        #include \"esp_tls.h\"\\n        esp_tls_cfg_t cfg = {\\n            .tls_version = ESP_TLS_VER_TLS_1_2,\\n        };\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_tls.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_tls_errors.inc\\n',\n",

Please refer to the Enabling protocom security version section in :doc:`Protocol Communication </api-reference/provisioning/protocomm>` for more details.\\n\\nCreating a Property\\n-------------------\\n\\nNow that we know how to start the **esp_local_ctrl** service, let\\'s add a property to it. Each property must have a unique ```name``` (string), a ``type`` (e.g., enum), ``flags``` (bit fields) and ``size```.\\n\\nThe ``size`` is to be kept 0, if we want our property value to be of variable length (e.g., if it is a string or bytestream). For data types with fixed-length property value, like int, float, etc., setting the ``size`` field to the right value helps **esp_local_ctrl** to perform internal checks on arguments received with write requests.\\n\\nThe interpretation of ``type`` and ``flags`` fields is totally upto the application, hence they may be used as enumerations, bitfields, or even simple integers. One way is to use ``type`` values to classify properties, while ``flags`` to specify characteristics of a property.\\n\\nHere is an example property which is to function as a timestamp. It is assumed that the application defines ``TYPE_TIMESTAMP`` and ``READONLY``, which are used for setting the ``type`` and ``flags`` fields here.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        /* Create a timestamp property */\\n        esp_local_ctrl_prop_t timestamp = {\\n            .name        = \"timestamp\",\\n            .type        = TYPE_TIMESTAMP,\\n            .size        = sizeof(int32_t),\\n            .flags       = READONLY,\\n            .ctx         = func_get_time,\\n            .ctx_free_fn = NULL\\n        };\\n\\n        /* Now register the property */\\n        esp_local_ctrl_add_property(&timestamp);\\n\\n\\nAlso notice that there is a ctx field, which is set to point to some custom `func_get_time()`. This can be used inside the property get/set handlers to retrieve timestamp.\\n\\nHere is an example of ``get_prop_values()`` handler, which is used for retrieving the timestamp.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        static esp_err_t get_property_values(size_t props_count,\\n                                             const esp_local_ctrl_prop_t *props,\\n                                             esp_local_ctrl_prop_val_t *prop_values,\\n                                             void *usr_ctx)\\n        {\\n            for (uint32_t i = 0; i < props_count; i++) {\\n                ESP_LOGI(TAG, \"Reading %s\", props[i].name);\\n                if (props[i].type == TYPE_TIMESTAMP) {\\n                    /* Obtain the timer function from ctx */\\n                    int32_t (*func_get_time)(void) = props[i].ctx;\\n\\n                    /* Use static variable for saving the value.

The service translates these messages into requests and then call the appropriate handlers (set/get). Then, the generated response for each handler is again packed into a protobuf message and transmitted back to the client.\\n\\nSee below the various protobuf messages understood by the **esp_local_ctrl** service:\\n\\n1. ``get_prop_count`` : This should simply return the total number of properties supported by the service.\\n2. ``get_prop_values`` : This accepts an array of indices and should return the information (name, type, flags) and values of the properties corresponding to those indices.\\n3. ``set_prop_values`` : This accepts an array of indices and an array of new values, which are used for setting the values of the properties corresponding to the indices.\\n\\nNote that indices may or may not be the same for a property, across multiple sessions. Therefore, the client must only use the names of the properties to uniquely identify them. So, every time a new session is established, the client should first call ``get_prop_count`` and then ``get_prop_values``, hence form an index-to-name mapping for all properties. Now when calling ``set_prop_values`` for a set of properties, it must first convert the names to indexes, using the created mapping. As emphasized earlier, the client must refresh the index-to-name mapping every time a new session is established with the same device.\\n\\nThe various protocomm endpoints provided by **esp_local_ctrl** are listed below:\\n\\n.. list-table:: Endpoints provided by ESP Local Control\\n   :widths: 10 25 50\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n\\n   * - Endpoint Name (Bluetooth Low Energy + GATT Server)\\n     - URI (HTTPS Server + mDNS)\\n     - Description\\n   * - esp_local_ctrl/version\\n     - https://<mdns-hostname>.local/esp_local_ctrl/version\\n     - Endpoint used for retrieving version string\\n   * - esp_local_ctrl/control\\n     - https://<mdns-hostname>.local/esp_local_ctrl/control\\n     - Endpoint used for sending or receiving control messages\\n\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_local_ctrl.inc\\n',\n",
       " 'ICMP Echo\\n=========\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used for diagnostic or control purposes or generated in response to errors in IP operations. The common network util ``ping`` is implemented based on the ICMP packets with the type field value of 0, also called ``Echo Reply``.\\n\\nDuring a ping session, the source host firstly sends out an ICMP echo request packet and wait for an ICMP echo reply with specific times. In this way, it also measures the round-trip time for the messages. After receiving a valid ICMP echo reply, the source host will generate statistics about the IP link layer (e.g., packet loss, elapsed time, etc).\\n\\nIt is common that IoT device needs to check whether a remote server is alive or not. The device should show the warnings to users when it got offline. It can be achieved by creating a ping session and sending or parsing ICMP echo packets periodically.\\n\\nTo make this internal procedure much easier for users, ESP-IDF provides some out-of-box APIs.\\n\\nCreate a New Ping Session\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTo create a ping session, you need to fill in the ``esp_ping_config_t`` configuration structure firstly, specifying target IP address, interval times, and etc. Optionally, you can also register some callback functions with the ``esp_ping_callbacks_t`` structure.\\n\\nExample method to create a new ping session and register callbacks:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    static void test_on_ping_success(esp_ping_handle_t hdl, void *args)\\n    {\\n        // optionally, get callback arguments\\n        // const char* str = (const char*) args;\\n        // printf(\"%s\\\\r\\\\n\", str); // \"foo\"\\n        uint8_t ttl;\\n        uint16_t seqno;\\n        uint32_t elapsed_time, recv_len;\\n        ip_addr_t target_addr;\\n        esp_ping_get_profile(hdl, ESP_PING_PROF_SEQNO, &seqno, sizeof(seqno));\\n        esp_ping_get_profile(hdl, ESP_PING_PROF_TTL, &ttl, sizeof(ttl));\\n        esp_ping_get_profile(hdl, ESP_PING_PROF_IPADDR, &target_addr, sizeof(target_addr));\\n        esp_ping_get_profile(hdl, ESP_PING_PROF_SIZE, &recv_len, sizeof(recv_len));\\n        esp_ping_get_profile(hdl, ESP_PING_PROF_TIMEGAP, &elapsed_time, sizeof(elapsed_time));\\n        printf(\"%d bytes from %s icmp_seq=%d ttl=%d time=%d ms\\\\n\",\\n               recv_len, inet_ntoa(target_addr.u_addr.ip4), seqno, ttl, elapsed_time);\\n    }\\n\\n    static void test_on_ping_timeout(esp_ping_handle_t hdl, void *args)\\n    {\\n        uint16_t seqno;\\n        ip_addr_t target_addr;\\n        esp_ping_get_profile(hdl, ESP_PING_PROF_SEQNO, &seqno, sizeof(seqno));\\n        esp_ping_get_profile(hdl, ESP_PING_PROF_IPADDR, &target_addr, sizeof(target_addr));\\n        printf(\"From %s icmp_seq=%d timeout\\\\n\", inet_ntoa(target_addr.u_addr.ip4), seqno);\\n    }\\n\\n    static void test_on_ping_end(esp_ping_handle_t hdl, void *args)\\n    {\\n        uint32_t transmitted;\\n        uint32_t received;\\n        uint32_t total_time_ms;\\n\\n        esp_ping_get_profile(hdl, ESP_PING_PROF_REQUEST, &transmitted, sizeof(transmitted));\\n        esp_ping_get_profile(hdl, ESP_PING_PROF_REPLY, &received, sizeof(received));\\n        esp_ping_get_profile(hdl, ESP_PING_PROF_DURATION, &total_time_ms, sizeof(total_time_ms));\\n        printf(\"%d packets transmitted, %d received, time %dms\\\\n\", transmitted, received, total_time_ms);\\n    }\\n\\n    void initialize_ping()\\n    {\\n        /* convert URL to IP address */\\n        ip_addr_t target_addr;\\n        struct addrinfo hint;\\n        struct addrinfo *res = NULL;\\n        memset(&hint, 0, sizeof(hint));\\n        memset(&target_addr, 0, sizeof(target_addr));\\n        getaddrinfo(\"www.espressif.com\", NULL, &hint, &res);\\n        struct in_addr addr4 = ((struct sockaddr_in *) (res->ai_addr))->sin_addr;\\n        inet_addr_to_ip4addr(ip_2_ip4(&target_addr), &addr4);\\n        freeaddrinfo(res);\\n\\n        esp_ping_config_t ping_config = ESP_PING_DEFAULT_CONFIG();\\n        ping_config.target_addr = target_addr;          // target IP address\\n        ping_config.count = ESP_PING_COUNT_INFINITE;    // ping in infinite mode, esp_ping_stop can stop it\\n\\n        /* set callback functions */\\n        esp_ping_callbacks_t cbs;\\n        cbs.on_ping_success = test_on_ping_success;\\n        cbs.on_ping_timeout = test_on_ping_timeout;\\n        cbs.on_ping_end = test_on_ping_end;\\n        cbs.cb_args = \"foo\";  // arguments that feeds to all callback functions, can be NULL\\n        cbs.cb_args = eth_event_group;\\n\\n        esp_ping_handle_t ping;\\n        esp_ping_new_session(&ping_config, &cbs, &ping);\\n    }\\n\\nStart and Stop Ping Session\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nYou can start and stop ping session with the handle returned by ``esp_ping_new_session``. Note that, the ping session does not start automatically after creation.

The protocol offers the following services:\\n\\n- Sending FIFO and receiving FIFO\\n- 52 8-bit R/W registers shared by host and slave (For details, see *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* > *SDIO Slave Controller* > *Register Summary* > SDIO SLC Host registers [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#sdioslave-reg-summ>`__])\\n- 16 general purpose interrupt sources, 8 from host to slave and 8 from slave to host\\n\\nTo begin communication, the host needs to enable the I/O Function 1 in the slave and access its registers as described below.\\n\\nCheck the code example: :example:`peripherals/sdio`\\n\\nThe :doc:`ESP Serial Slave Link </api-reference/protocols/esp_serial_slave_link>` component implements the logic of this protocol for ESP32 SDIO Host when communicating with an ESP32 SDIO slave.\\n\\n.. _esp_sdio_slave_shared_registers:\\n\\nSlave Register Table\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n32-bit\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\n- 0x044 (TOKEN_RDATA): in which bit 27-16 holds the number of the receiving buffer.\\n- 0x058 (INT_ST): holds the interrupt source bits from slave to host.\\n- 0x060 (PKT_LEN): holds the accumulated data length (in bytes) already read by host plus the data copied to the buffer but yet to be read.\\n- 0x0D4 (INT_CLR): write 1 to clear interrupt bits corresponding to INT_ST.\\n- 0x0DC (INT_ENA): mask bits for interrupts from slave to host.\\n\\n8-bit\\n\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nShared general purpose registers:\\n\\n- 0x06C-0x077: R/W registers 0-11 shared by slave and host.\\n- 0x07A-0x07B: R/W registers 14-15 shared by slave and host.\\n- 0x07E-0x07F: R/W registers 18-19 shared by slave and host.\\n- 0x088-0x08B: R/W registers 24-27 shared by slave and host.\\n- 0x09C-0x0BB: R/W registers 32-63 shared by slave and host.\\n\\nInterrupt Registers:\\n\\n- 0x08D (SLAVE_INT): bits for host to interrupt slave. auto clear.\\n\\nFIFO (Sending and Receiving)\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\n0x090 - 0x1F7FF are reserved for FIFOs.\\n\\nThe address of CMD53 is related to the length requested to read from or write to the slave in a single transfer, as demonstrated by the equation below:\\n\\n    *requested length = 0x1F800 - address*\\n\\nThe slave responds to data that has a length equal to the length field of CMD53. In cases where the data is longer than the **requested length**, the data will be zero filled (when sending) or discarded (when receiving). This includes both the block and the byte mode of CMD53.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The function number should be set to 1, and OP Code should be set to 1 (for CMD53).\\n\\n    In order to achieve higher efficiency when accessing the FIFO by an arbitrary length, the block and byte modes of CMD53 can be used in combination. For example, given that the block size is set to 512 by default, you can write or get 1031 bytes of data from the FIFO by doing the following:\\n\\n    1. Send CMD53 in block mode, block count = 2 (1024 bytes) to address 0x1F3F9 = 0x1F800 - **1031**.\\n    2. Then send CMD53 in byte mode, byte count = 8 (or 7 if your controller supports that) to address 0x1F7F9 = 0x1F800 - **7**.\\n\\n.. _esp_sdio_slave_interrupts:\\n\\nInterrupts\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSDIO interrupts are \"level sensitive\". For host interrupts, the slave sends an interrupt by pulling the DAT1 line down at a proper time. The host detects when the interrupt line is pulled down and reads the INT_ST register to determine the source of the interrupt. After that, the host can clear the interrupt bits by writing the ``INT_CLR`` register and process the interrupt. The host can also mask unneeded sources by clearing the bits in the INT_ENA register corresponding to the sources. If all the sources are cleared (or masked), the DAT1 line goes inactive.\\n\\nOn {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, the corresponding ``host_int`` bits are: bit 0 to bit 7.\\n\\nFor slave interrupts, the host sends a transfer to write the ``SLAVE_INT`` register. Once a bit is set to 1, the slave hardware and the driver will detect it and inform the application.\\n\\n.. _esp_sdio_slave_rcv_fifo:\\n\\nReceiving FIFO\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTo write to the slave\\'s receiving FIFO, the host should complete the following steps:\\n\\n1. **Read the TOKEN1 field (bits 27-16) of the register TOKEN_RDATA (0x044)**. The buffer number remaining is TOKEN1 minus the number of buffers used by host.\\n2. **Make sure the buffer number is sufficient** (*buffer_size* x *buffer_num* is greater than the data to write, *buffer_size* is pre-defined between the host and the slave before the communication starts). Otherwise, keep returning to step 1 until the buffer size is sufficient.\\n3. **Write to the FIFO address with CMD53**. Note that the *requested length* should not exceed the length calculated at step 2, and the FIFO address is related to *requested length*.\\n4. **Calculate used buffers**. Note that a partially-used buffer at the tail is counted as used.\\n\\n.. _esp_sdio_slave_send_fifo:\\n\\nSending FIFO\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTo read the slave\\'s sending FIFO, the host should complete the following steps:\\n\\n1. **Wait for the interrupt line to become active** (optional, low by default).\\n2. **Read (poll) the interrupt bits in the INT_ST register** to monitor if new packets exist.\\n3. **If new packets are ready, read the PKT_LEN register**. Before reading the packets, determine the length of data to be read. As the host keeps the length of data already read from the slave, subtract this value from ``PKT_LEN``, the result will be the maximum length of data available for reading. If no data has been added to the sending FIFO yet, wait and poll until the slave is ready and update ``PKT_LEN``.\\n4. **Read from the FIFO using CMD53**. Note that the **requested length** should not be greater than calculated at Step 3, and the FIFO address is related to **requested length**.\\n5. **Update the read length**.\\n',\n",
       " 'HTTP Server\\n===========\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nThe HTTP Server component provides an ability for running a lightweight web server on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. Following are detailed steps to use the API exposed by HTTP Server:\\n\\n    * :cpp:func:`httpd_start`: Creates an instance of HTTP server, allocate memory/resources for it depending upon the specified configuration and outputs a handle to the server instance. The server has both, a listening socket (TCP) for HTTP traffic, and a control socket (UDP) for control signals, which are selected in a round robin fashion in the server task loop. The task priority and stack size are configurable during server instance creation by passing ``httpd_config_t`` structure to ``httpd_start()``. TCP traffic is parsed as HTTP requests and, depending on the requested URI, user registered handlers are invoked which are supposed to send back HTTP response packets.\\n    * :cpp:func:`httpd_stop`: This stops the server with the provided handle and frees up any associated memory/resources. This is a blocking function that first signals a halt to the server task and then waits for the task to terminate. While stopping, the task closes all open connections, removes registered URI handlers and resets all session context data to empty.\\n    * :cpp:func:`httpd_register_uri_handler`: A URI handler is registered by passing object of type ``httpd_uri_t`` structure which has members including ``uri`` name, ``method`` type (eg. ``HTTPD_GET/HTTPD_POST/HTTPD_PUT`` etc.), function pointer of type ``esp_err_t *handler (httpd_req_t *req)`` and ``user_ctx`` pointer to user context data.\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        /* Our URI handler function to be called during GET /uri request */\\n        esp_err_t get_handler(httpd_req_t *req)\\n        {\\n            /* Send a simple response */\\n            const char resp[] = \"URI GET Response\";\\n            httpd_resp_send(req, resp, HTTPD_RESP_USE_STRLEN);\\n            return ESP_OK;\\n        }\\n\\n        /* Our URI handler function to be called during POST /uri request */\\n        esp_err_t post_handler(httpd_req_t *req)\\n        {\\n            /* Destination buffer for content of HTTP POST request.\\n             * httpd_req_recv() accepts char* only, but content could\\n             * as well be any binary data (needs type casting).\\n             * In case of string data, null termination will be absent, and\\n             * content length would give length of string */\\n            char content[100];\\n\\n            /* Truncate if content length larger than the buffer */\\n            size_t recv_size = MIN(req->content_len, sizeof(content));\\n\\n            int ret = httpd_req_recv(req, content, recv_size);\\n            if (ret <= 0) {  /* 0 return value indicates connection closed */\\n                /* Check if timeout occurred */\\n                if (ret == HTTPD_SOCK_ERR_TIMEOUT) {\\n                    /* In case of timeout one can choose to retry calling\\n                     * httpd_req_recv(), but to keep it simple, here we\\n                     * respond with an HTTP 408 (Request Timeout) error */\\n                    httpd_resp_send_408(req);\\n                }\\n                /* In case of error, returning ESP_FAIL will\\n                 * ensure that the underlying socket is closed */\\n                return ESP_FAIL;\\n            }\\n\\n            /* Send a simple response */\\n            const char resp[] = \"URI POST Response\";\\n            httpd_resp_send(req, resp, HTTPD_RESP_USE_STRLEN);\\n            return ESP_OK;\\n        }\\n\\n        /* URI handler structure for GET /uri */\\n        httpd_uri_t uri_get = {\\n            .uri      = \"/uri\",\\n            .method   = HTTP_GET,\\n            .handler  = get_handler,\\n            .user_ctx = NULL\\n        };\\n\\n        /* URI handler structure for POST /uri */\\n        httpd_uri_t uri_post = {\\n            .uri      = \"/uri\",\\n            .method   = HTTP_POST,\\n            .handler  = post_handler,\\n            .user_ctx = NULL\\n        };\\n\\n        /* Function for starting the webserver */\\n        httpd_handle_t start_webserver(void)\\n        {\\n            /* Generate default configuration */\\n            httpd_config_t config = HTTPD_DEFAULT_CONFIG();\\n\\n            /* Empty handle to esp_http_server */\\n            httpd_handle_t server = NULL;\\n\\n            /* Start the httpd server */\\n            if (httpd_start(&server, &config) == ESP_OK) {\\n                /* Register URI handlers */\\n                httpd_register_uri_handler(server, &uri_get);\\n                httpd_register_uri_handler(server, &uri_post);\\n            }\\n            /* If server failed to start, handle will be NULL */\\n            return server;\\n        }\\n\\n        /* Function for stopping the webserver */\\n        void stop_webserver(httpd_handle_t server)\\n        {\\n            if (server) {\\n                /* Stop the httpd server */\\n                httpd_stop(server);\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\nSimple HTTP Server Example\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nCheck HTTP server example under :example:`protocols/http_server/simple` where handling of arbitrary content lengths, reading request headers and URL query parameters, and setting response headers is demonstrated.\\n\\n\\nPersistent Connections\\n----------------------\\n\\nHTTP server features persistent connections, allowing for the re-use of the same connection (session) for several transfers, all the while maintaining context specific data for the session.

These slave devices rely on some common buses, and have their own communication protocols over those buses. The ``esp_serial_slave_link`` component is designed for the master to communicate with ESP slave devices through those protocols over the bus drivers.\\n\\nAfter an ``esp_serial_slave_link`` device is initialized properly, the application can use it to communicate with the ESP slave devices conveniently.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  The ESP-IDF component ``esp_serial_slave_link`` has been moved from ESP-IDF since version v5.0 to a separate repository:\\n\\n  * `ESSL component on GitHub <https://github.com/espressif/idf-extra-components/tree/master/esp_serial_slave_link>`__\\n\\n  To add ESSL component in your project, please run ``idf.py add-dependency espressif/esp_serial_slave_link``.\\n\\n\\nEspressif Device Protocols\\n--------------------------\\n\\nFor more details about Espressif device protocols, see the following documents.\\n\\n.. toctree::\\n    :maxdepth: 1\\n\\n    :SOC_SDIO_SLAVE_SUPPORTED: esp_sdio_slave_protocol\\n    esp_spi_slave_protocol\\n\\nTerminology\\n-----------\\n\\n- ESSL: Abbreviation for ESP Serial Slave Link, the component described by this document.\\n\\n- Master: The device running the ``esp_serial_slave_link`` component.\\n\\n- ESSL device: a virtual device on the master associated with an ESP slave device. The device context has the knowledge of the slave protocol above the bus, relying on some bus drivers to communicate with the slave.\\n\\n- ESSL device handle: a handle to ESSL device context containing the configuration, status and data required by the ESSL component. The context stores the driver configurations, communication state, data shared by master and slave, etc.\\n\\n   - The context should be initialized before it is used, and get deinitialized if not used any more. The master application operates on the ESSL device through this handle.\\n\\n- ESP slave: the slave device connected to the bus, which ESSL component is designed to communicate with.\\n\\n- Bus: The bus over which the master and the slave communicate with each other.\\n\\n- Slave protocol: The special communication protocol specified by Espressif HW/SW over the bus.\\n\\n- TX buffer num: a counter, which is on the slave and can be read by the master, indicates the accumulated buffer numbers that the slave has loaded to the hardware to receive data from the master.\\n\\n- RX data size: a counter, which is on the slave and can be read by the master, indicates the accumulated data size that the slave has loaded to the hardware to send to the master.\\n\\nServices Provided by ESP Slave\\n------------------------------\\n\\nThere are some common services provided by the Espressif slaves:\\n\\n1. Tohost Interrupts: The slave can inform the master about certain events by the interrupt line. (optional)\\n\\n2. Frhost Interrupts: The master can inform the slave about certain events.\\n\\n3. TX FIFO (master to slave): The slave can receive data from the master in units of receiving buffers.\\n\\n   The slave updates the TX buffer num to inform the master how much data it can receive, and the master then read the TX buffer num, and take off the used buffer number to know how many buffers are remaining.\\n\\n4. RX FIFO (slave to master): The slave can send data in stream to the master. The SDIO slave can also indicate it has new data to send to master by the interrupt line.\\n\\n   The slave updates the RX data size to inform the master how much data it has prepared to send, and then the master read the data size, and take off the data length it has already received to know how many data is remaining.\\n\\n5. Shared registers: The master can read some part of the registers on the slave, and also write these registers to let the slave read.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SDIO_SLAVE_SUPPORTED\\n\\n   The services provided by the slave depends on the slave's model. See :ref:`esp_sdio_slave_caps` and :ref:`esp_spi_slave_caps` for more details.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_SDIO_SLAVE_SUPPORTED\\n\\n   The services provided by the slave depends on the slave's model. See :ref:`esp_spi_slave_caps` for more details.\\n\\n\\nInitialization of ESP Serial Slave Link\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\n.. _essl_sdio_slave_init:\\n\\nESP SDIO Slave\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe ESP SDIO slave link (ESSL SDIO) devices relies on the SDMMC component. It includes the usage of communicating with ESP SDIO Slave device via the SDMMC Host or SDSPI Host feature. The ESSL device should be initialized as below:\\n\\n1. Initialize a SDMMC card (see :doc:` Document of SDMMC driver </api-reference/storage/sdmmc>`) structure.\\n\\n2. Call :cpp:func:`sdmmc_card_init` to initialize the card.\\n\\n3. Initialize the ESSL device with :cpp:type:`essl_sdio_config_t`. The ``card`` member should be the :cpp:type:`sdmmc_card_t` got in step 2, and the ``recv_buffer_size`` member should be filled correctly according to pre-negotiated value.\\n\\n4. Call :cpp:func:`essl_init` to do initialization of the SDIO part.\\n\\n5. Call :cpp:func:`essl_wait_for_ready` to wait for the slave to be ready.\\n\\nESP SPI Slave\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    If you are communicating with the ESP SDIO Slave device through SPI interface, you should use the :ref:`SDIO interface <essl_sdio_slave_init>` instead.\\n\\nHas not been supported yet.\\n\\nAPIs\\n----\\n\\nAfter the initialization process above is performed, you can call the APIs below to make use of the services provided by the slave:\\n\\nTohost Interrupts (Optional)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n1. Call :cpp:func:`essl_get_intr_ena` to know which events trigger the interrupts to the master.\\n\\n2. Call :cpp:func:`essl_set_intr_ena` to set the events that trigger interrupts to the master.\\n\\n3. Call :cpp:func:`essl_wait_int` to wait until interrupt from the slave, or timeout.\\n\\n4. When interrupt is triggered, call :cpp:func:`essl_get_intr` to know which events are active, and call :cpp:func:`essl_clear_intr` to clear them.\\n\\nFrhost Interrupts\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n1. Call :cpp:func:`essl_send_slave_intr` to trigger general purpose interrupt of the slave.\\n\\nTX FIFO\\n^^^^^^^\\n\\n1. Call :cpp:func:`essl_get_tx_buffer_num` to know how many buffers the slave has prepared to receive data from the master. This is optional. The master will poll ``tx_buffer_num`` when it tries to send packets to the slave, until the slave has enough buffer or timeout.\\n\\n2. Call :cpp:func:`essl_send_packet` to send data to the slave.\\n\\nRX FIFO\\n^^^^^^^\\n\\n1. Call :cpp:func:`essl_get_rx_data_size` to know how many data the slave has prepared to send to the master. This is optional. When the master tries to receive data from the slave, it updates the ``rx_data_size`` for once, if the current ``rx_data_size`` is shorter than the buffer size the master prepared to receive. And it may poll the ``rx_data_size`` if the ``rx_data_size`` keeps 0, until timeout.\\n\\n2. Call :cpp:func:`essl_get_packet` to receive data from the slave.\\n\\nReset Counters (Optional)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nCall :cpp:func:`essl_reset_cnt` to reset the internal counter if you find the slave has reset its counter.\\n\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe example below shows how {IDF_TARGET_NAME} SDIO host and slave communicate with each other.

       " 'ESP HTTP Client\\n===============\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\n``esp_http_client`` component provides a set of APIs for making HTTP/S requests from ESP-IDF applications. The steps to use these APIs are as follows:\\n\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_http_client_init`: Creates an :cpp:type:`esp_http_client_handle_t` instance, i.e., an HTTP client handle based on the given :cpp:type:`esp_http_client_config_t` configuration. This function must be the first to be called; default values are assumed for the configuration values that are not explicitly defined by the user.\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_http_client_perform`: Performs all operations of the ``esp_http_client`` - opening the connection, exchanging data, and closing the connection (as required), while blocking the current task before its completion. All related events are invoked through the event handler (as specified in :cpp:type:`esp_http_client_config_t`).\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_http_client_cleanup`: Closes the connection (if any) and frees up all the memory allocated to the HTTP client instance. This must be the last function to be called after the completion of operations.\\n\\n\\nApplication Example\\n-------------------\\n\\nSimple example that uses ESP HTTP Client to make HTTP/S requests can be found at :example:`protocols/esp_http_client`.\\n\\n\\nBasic HTTP Request\\n------------------\\n\\nCheck out the example functions ``http_rest_with_url`` and ``http_rest_with_hostname_path`` in the application example for implementation details.\\n\\n\\nPersistent Connections\\n----------------------\\n\\nPersistent connection means that the HTTP client can re-use the same connection for several exchanges. If the server does not request to close the connection with the ``Connection: close`` header, the connection is not dropped but is instead kept open and used for further requests.\\n\\nTo allow ESP HTTP client to take full advantage of persistent connections, one should make as many requests as possible using the same handle instance. Check out the example functions ``http_rest_with_url`` and ``http_rest_with_hostname_path`` in the application example. Here, once the connection is created, multiple requests (``GET``, ``POST``, ``PUT``, etc.) are made before the connection is closed.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    Use Secure Element (ATECC608) for TLS\\n    _____________________________________\\n\\n    A secure element (ATECC608) can be also used for the underlying TLS connection in the HTTP client connection. Please refer to the **ATECC608A (Secure Element) with ESP-TLS** section in the :doc:`ESP-TLS documentation </api-reference/protocols/esp_tls>` for more details. The secure element support has to be first enabled in menuconfig through :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TLS_USE_SECURE_ELEMENT`. Then the HTTP client can be configured to use secure element as follows:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        esp_http_client_config_t cfg = {\\n            /* other configurations options */\\n            .use_secure_element = true,\\n        };\\n\\n\\nHTTPS Request\\n-------------\\n\\nESP HTTP client supports SSL connections using **mbedTLS**, with the ``url`` configuration starting with ``https`` scheme or ``transport_type`` set to ``HTTP_TRANSPORT_OVER_SSL``. HTTPS support can be configured via :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_HTTP_CLIENT_ENABLE_HTTPS` (enabled by default).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    While making HTTPS requests, if server verification is needed, an additional root certificate (in PEM format) needs to be provided to the ``cert_pem`` member in the ``esp_http_client_config_t`` configuration. Users can also use the ``ESP x509 Certificate Bundle`` for server verification using the ``crt_bundle_attach`` member of the ``esp_http_client_config_t`` configuration.\\n\\nCheck out the example functions ``https_with_url`` and ``https_with_hostname_path`` in the application example for implementation details of the above note.\\n\\n\\nHTTP Stream\\n-----------\\n\\nSome applications need to open the connection and control the exchange of data actively (data streaming). In such cases, the application flow is different from regular requests. Example flow is given below:\\n\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_http_client_init`: Create a HTTP client handle.\\n    * ``esp_http_client_set_*`` or ``esp_http_client_delete_*``: Modify the HTTP connection parameters (optional).\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_http_client_open`: Open the HTTP connection with ``write_len`` parameter (content length that needs to be written to server), set ``write_len=0`` for read-only connection.\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_http_client_write`: Write data to server with a maximum length equal to ``write_len`` of :cpp:func:`esp_http_client_open` function; no need to call this function for ``write_len=0``.\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_http_client_fetch_headers`: Read the HTTP Server response headers, after sending the request headers and server data (if any). Returns the ``content-length`` from the server and can be succeeded by :cpp:func:`esp_http_client_get_status_code` for getting the HTTP status of the connection.\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_http_client_read`: Read the HTTP stream.\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_http_client_close`: Close the connection.\\n    * :cpp:func:`esp_http_client_cleanup`: Release allocated resources.\\n\\nCheck out the example function ``http_perform_as_stream_reader`` in the application example for implementation details.\\n\\n\\nHTTP Authentication\\n-------------------\\n\\nESP HTTP client supports both **Basic** and **Digest** Authentication.\\n    * Users can provide the username and password in the ``url`` or the ``username`` and ``password`` members of the ``esp_http_client_config_t`` configuration. For ``auth_type = HTTP_AUTH_TYPE_BASIC``, the HTTP client takes only one perform operation to pass the authentication process.\\n    * If ``auth_type = HTTP_AUTH_TYPE_NONE``, but the ``username`` and ``password`` fields are present in the configuration, the HTTP client takes two perform operations. The client will receive the ``401 Unauthorized`` header in its first attempt to connect to the server. Based on this information, it decides which authentication method to choose and performs it in the second operation.\\n    * Check out the example functions ``http_auth_basic``, ``http_auth_basic_redirect`` (for Basic authentication) and ``http_auth_digest`` (for Digest authentication) in the application example for implementation details.\\n    * Currently, Digest authentication supports only MD5 and SHA-256 algorithms.\\n\\n\\nExamples of Authentication Configuration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    * Authentication with URI\\n\\n        .. highlight:: c\\n\\n        ::\\n\\n            esp_http_client_config_t config = {\\n                .url = \"http://user:passwd@httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd\",\\n                .auth_type = HTTP_AUTH_TYPE_BASIC,\\n            };\\n\\n\\n    * Authentication with username and password entry\\n\\n        .. highlight:: c\\n\\n        ::\\n\\n            esp_http_client_config_t config = {\\n                .url = \"http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd\",\\n                .username = \"user\",\\n                .password = \"passwd\",\\n                .auth_type = HTTP_AUTH_TYPE_BASIC,\\n            };\\n\\nEvent Handling\\n--------------\\n\\nESP HTTP Client supports event handling by triggering an event handler corresponding to the event which takes place. :cpp:enum:`esp_http_client_event_id_t` contains all the events which could occur while performing an HTTP request using the ESP HTTP Client.\\n\\nTo enable event handling, you just need to set a callback function using the :cpp:member:`esp_http_client_config_t::event_handler` member.\\n\\nESP HTTP Client Diagnostic Information\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nDiagnostic information could be helpful to gain insights into a problem. In the case of ESP HTTP Client, the diagnostic information can be collected by registering an event handler with :doc:`the Event Loop library <../system/esp_event>`. This feature has been added by keeping in mind the `ESP Insights <https://github.com/espressif/esp-insights>`_ framework which collects the diagnostic information. However, this feature can also be used without any dependency on the ESP Insights framework for the diagnostic purpose. Event handler can be registered to the event loop using the :cpp:func:`esp_event_handler_register` function.\\n\\nExpected data types for different HTTP Client events in the event loop are as follows:\\n\\n    - HTTP_EVENT_ERROR            :   ``esp_http_client_handle_t``\\n    - HTTP_EVENT_ON_CONNECTED     :   ``esp_http_client_handle_t``\\n    - HTTP_EVENT_HEADERS_SENT     :   ``esp_http_client_handle_t``\\n    - HTTP_EVENT_ON_HEADER        :   ``esp_http_client_handle_t``\\n    - HTTP_EVENT_ON_DATA          :   ``esp_http_client_on_data_t``\\n    - HTTP_EVENT_ON_FINISH        :   ``esp_http_client_handle_t``\\n    - HTTP_EVENT_DISCONNECTED     :   ``esp_http_client_handle_t``\\n    - HTTP_EVENT_REDIRECT         :   ``esp_http_client_redirect_event_data_t``\\n\\nThe :cpp:type:`esp_http_client_handle_t` received along with the event data will be valid until :cpp:enumerator:`HTTP_EVENT_DISCONNECTED <esp_http_client_event_id_t::HTTP_EVENT_DISCONNECTED>` is not received. This handle has been sent primarily to differentiate between different client connections and must not be used for any other purpose, as it may change based on client connection state.\\n\\nTLS Protocol Version\\n--------------------\\n\\nTLS protocol version to be used for the underlying TLS connection can be set in :cpp:type:`esp_http_client_config_t`. Please refer to the **TLS Protocol Version** section in the :doc:`/api-reference/protocols/esp_tls` for more details.\\n\\nThe TLS protocol version for the HTTP client can be configured as follows:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        #include \"esp_http_client.h\"\\n        esp_http_client_config_t config = {\\n            .tls_version = ESP_HTTP_CLIENT_TLS_VER_TLS_1_2,\\n        };\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_http_client.inc\\n',\n",

Using the gen_crt_bundle.py python utility, the certificates' subject name and public key are stored in a file and embedded in the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} binary.\\n\\nWhen generating the bundle you may choose between:\\n\\n * The full root certificate bundle from Mozilla, containing more than 130 certificates. The current bundle was updated Tue Dec 12 04:12:04 2023 GMT.\\n * A pre-selected filter list of the name of the most commonly used root certificates, reducing the amount of certificates to around 41 while still having around 90% absolute usage coverage and 99% market share coverage according to SSL certificate authorities statistics.\\n\\nIn addition, it is possible to specify a path to a certificate file or a directory containing certificates which then will be added to the generated bundle.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Trusting all root certificates means the list will have to be updated if any of the certificates are retracted. This includes removing them from ``cacrt_all.pem``.\\n\\nConfiguration\\n-------------\\n\\nMost configuration is done through menuconfig. CMake generates the bundle according to the configuration and embed it.\\n\\n * :ref:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_CERTIFICATE_BUNDLE`: automatically build and attach the bundle.\\n * :ref:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_DEFAULT_CERTIFICATE_BUNDLE`: decide which certificates to include from the complete root certificate list.\\n * :ref:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_CUSTOM_CERTIFICATE_BUNDLE_PATH`: specify the path of any additional certificates to embed in the bundle.\\n\\nTo enable the bundle when using ESP-TLS simply pass the function pointer to the bundle attach function:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    esp_tls_cfg_t cfg = {\\n         .crt_bundle_attach = esp_crt_bundle_attach,\\n    };\\n\\nThis is done to avoid embedding the certificate bundle unless activated by the user.\\n\\nIf using mbedTLS directly then the bundle may be activated by directly calling the attach function during the setup process:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    mbedtls_ssl_config conf;\\n    mbedtls_ssl_config_init(&conf);\\n\\n    esp_crt_bundle_attach(&conf);\\n\\n\\n.. _updating_bundle:\\n\\nGenerating the List of Root Certificates\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nThe list of root certificates comes from Mozilla's NSS root certificate store, which can be found `here <https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA/Included_Certificates>`_\\n\\nThe list can be downloaded and created by running the script ``mk-ca-bundle.pl`` that is distributed as a part of `curl <https://github.com/curl/curl>`_.\\n\\nAnother alternative would be to download the finished list directly from the curl website: `CA certificates extracted from Mozilla <https://curl.se/docs/caextract.html>`_\\n\\nThe common certificates bundle were made by selecting the authorities with a market share of more than 1% from w3tech's `SSL Survey <https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/ssl_certificate>`_.\\n\\nThese authorities were then used to pick the names of the certificates for the filter list, ``cmn_crt_authorities.csv``, from `this list <https://ccadb-public.secure.force.com/mozilla/IncludedCACertificateReportPEMCSV>`_ provided by Mozilla.\\n\\n\\nUpdating the Certificate Bundle\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nThe bundle is embedded into the app and can be updated along with the app by an OTA update. If you want to include a more up-to-date bundle than the bundle currently included in ESP-IDF, then the certificate list can be downloaded from Mozilla as described in :ref:`updating_bundle`.\\n\\n\\nPeriodic Sync\\n-------------\\n\\nThe bundle is kept updated by periodic sync with the Mozilla's NSS root certificate store. The deprecated certs from the upstream bundle are added to deprecated list (for compatibility reasons) in ESP-IDF minor or patch release. If required, the deprecated certs can be added to the default bundle by enabling :ref:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_CERTIFICATE_BUNDLE_DEPRECATED_LIST`. The deprecated certs shall be removed (reset) on the next major ESP-IDF release.\\n\\nApplication Examples\\n--------------------\\n\\nSimple HTTPS example that uses ESP-TLS to establish a secure socket connection using the certificate bundle with two custom certificates added for verification: :example:`protocols/https_x509_bundle`.\\n\\nHTTPS example that uses ESP-TLS and the default bundle: :example:`protocols/https_request`.\\n\\nHTTPS example that uses mbedTLS and the default bundle: :example:`protocols/https_mbedtls`.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_crt_bundle.inc\\n\",\n",

QoS 1 and 2 have different behaviors since the protocol requires extra steps to complete the process.\\n\\nThe ESP-MQTT library opts to always retransmit unacknowledged QoS 1 and 2 publish messages to avoid losses in faulty connections, even though the MQTT specification requires the re-transmission only on reconnect with Clean Session flag been set to 0 (set :cpp:member:`disable_clean_session <esp_mqtt_client_config_t::session_t::disable_clean_session>` to true for this behavior).\\n\\nQoS 1 and 2 messages that may need retransmission are always enqueued, but first transmission try occurs immediately if :cpp:func:`esp_mqtt_client_publish <esp_mqtt_client_publish>` is used. A transmission retry for unacknowledged messages will occur after :cpp:member:`message_retransmit_timeout <esp_mqtt_client_config_t::session_t::message_retransmit_timeout>`.

The client is now ready to send and receive data.\\n* ``MQTT_EVENT_DISCONNECTED``: The client has aborted the connection due to being unable to read or write data, e.g., because the server is unavailable.\\n* ``MQTT_EVENT_SUBSCRIBED``: The broker has acknowledged the client\\'s subscribe request. The event data contains the message ID of the subscribe message.\\n* ``MQTT_EVENT_UNSUBSCRIBED``: The broker has acknowledged the client\\'s unsubscribe request. The event data contains the message ID of the unsubscribe message.\\n* ``MQTT_EVENT_PUBLISHED``: The broker has acknowledged the client\\'s publish message. This is only posted for QoS level 1 and 2, as level 0 does not use acknowledgements. The event data contains the message ID of the publish message.\\n* ``MQTT_EVENT_DATA``: The client has received a publish message. The event data contains: message ID, name of the topic it was published to, received data and its length. For data that exceeds the internal buffer, multiple ``MQTT_EVENT_DATA`` events are posted and :cpp:member:`current_data_offset <esp_mqtt_event_t::current_data_offset>` and :cpp:member:`total_data_len <esp_mqtt_event_t::total_data_len>` from event data updated to keep track of the fragmented message.\\n* ``MQTT_EVENT_ERROR``: The client has encountered an error.

Each transaction may consist of the following phases (listed by the order they should exist):\\n\\n- Command: 8-bit, master to slave\\n\\n    This phase determines the rest phases of the transactions. See :ref:`spi_slave_hd_supported_cmds`.\\n\\n- Address: 8-bit, master to slave, optional\\n\\n    For some commands (WRBUF, RDBUF), this phase specifies the address of the shared register to write to/read from. For other commands with this phase, they are meaningless but still have to exist in the transaction.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s2\\n\\n    - Dummy: 8-bit (for 1-bit mode) or 4-bit (for 2/4-bit mode), floating, optional\\n\\n        This phase is the turnaround time between the master and the slave on the bus, and also provides enough time for the slave to prepare the data to send to the master.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32s2\\n\\n    - Dummy: 8-bit, floating, optional\\n\\n        This phase is the turnaround time between the master and the slave on the bus, and also provides enough time for the slave to prepare the data to send to the master.\\n\\n- Data: variable length, the direction is also determined by the command.\\n\\n    This may be a data OUT phase, in which the direction is slave to master, or a data IN phase, in which the direction is master to slave.\\n\\nThe **direction** means which side (master or slave) controls the MOSI, MISO, WP, and HD pins.\\n\\nData IO Modes\\n-------------\\n\\nIn some IO modes, more data wires can be used to send the data. As a result, the SPI clock cycles required for the same amount of data will be less than in the 1-bit mode. For example, in QIO mode, address and data (IN and OUT) should be sent on all 4 data wires (MOSI, MISO, WP, and HD). Here are the modes supported by the ESP32-S2 SPI slave and the wire number (WN) used in corresponding modes.\\n\\n+-------+------------+------------+--------------+---------+\\n| Mode  | Command WN | Address WN | Dummy cycles | Data WN |\\n+=======+============+============+==============+=========+\\n| 1-bit | 1          | 1          | 1            | 1       |\\n+-------+------------+------------+--------------+---------+\\n| DOUT  | 1          | 1          | 4            | 2       |\\n+-------+------------+------------+--------------+---------+\\n| DIO   | 1          | 2          | 4            | 2       |\\n+-------+------------+------------+--------------+---------+\\n| QOUT  | 1          | 1          | 4            | 4       |\\n+-------+------------+------------+--------------+---------+\\n| QIO   | 1          | 4          | 4            | 4       |\\n+-------+------------+------------+--------------+---------+\\n| QPI   | 4          | 4          | 4            | 4       |\\n+-------+------------+------------+--------------+---------+\\n\\nNormally, which mode is used is determined by the command sent by the master (See :ref:`spi_slave_hd_supported_cmds`), except the QPI mode.\\n\\nQPI Mode\\n^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe QPI mode is a special state of the SPI Slave. The master can send the ENQPI command to put the slave into the QPI mode state. In the QPI mode, the command is also sent in 4-bit, thus it is not compatible with the normal modes. The master should only send QPI commands when the slave is in QPI mode. To exit from the QPI mode, master can send the EXQPI command.\\n\\n.. _spi_slave_hd_supported_cmds:\\n\\nSupported Commands\\n------------------\\n\\n.. note::\\n    The command name is in a master-oriented direction. For example, WRBUF means master writes the buffer of slave.\\n\\n+----------+---------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+\\n| Name     | Description         | Command | Address  | Data                                                     |\\n+==========+=====================+=========+==========+==========================================================+\\n| WRBUF    | Write buffer        | 0x01    | Buf addr | master to slave, no longer than buffer size              |\\n+----------+---------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+\\n| RDBUF    | Read buffer         | 0x02    | Buf addr | slave to master, no longer than buffer size              |\\n+----------+---------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+\\n| WRDMA    | Write DMA           | 0x03    | 8 bits   | master to slave, no longer than length provided by slave |\\n+----------+---------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+\\n| RDDMA    | Read DMA            | 0x04    | 8 bits   | slave to master, no longer than length provided by slave |\\n+----------+---------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+\\n| SEG_DONE | Segments done       | 0x05    | -        | -                                                        |\\n+----------+---------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+\\n| ENQPI    | Enter QPI mode      | 0x06    | -        | -                                                        |\\n+----------+---------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+\\n| WR_DONE  | Write segments done | 0x07    | -        | -                                                        |\\n+----------+---------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+\\n| CMD8     | Interrupt           | 0x08    | -        | -                                                        |\\n+----------+---------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+\\n| CMD9     | Interrupt           | 0x09    | -        | -                                                        |\\n+----------+---------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+\\n| CMDA     | Interrupt           | 0x0A    | -        | -                                                        |\\n+----------+---------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+\\n| EXQPI    | Exit QPI mode       | 0xDD    | -        | -                                                        |\\n+----------+---------------------+---------+----------+----------------------------------------------------------+\\n\\nMoreover, WRBUF, RDBUF, WRDMA, and RDDMA commands have their 2-bit and 4-bit version. To do transactions in 2-bit or 4-bit mode, send the original command ORed by the corresponding command mask below. For example, command 0xA1 means WRBUF in QIO mode.\\n\\n+-------+------+\\n| Mode  | Mask |\\n+=======+======+\\n| 1-bit | 0x00 |\\n+-------+------+\\n| DOUT  | 0x10 |\\n+-------+------+\\n| DIO   | 0x50 |\\n+-------+------+\\n| QOUT  | 0x20 |\\n+-------+------+\\n| QIO   | 0xA0 |\\n+-------+------+\\n| QPI   | 0xA0 |\\n+-------+------+\\n\\nSegment Transaction Mode\\n------------------------\\n\\nSegment transaction mode is the only mode supported by the SPI Slave HD driver for now. In this mode, for a transaction the slave loads onto the DMA, the master is allowed to read or write in segments. In this way, the master does not have to prepare a large buffer as the size of data provided by the slave. After the master finishes reading/writing a buffer, it has to send the corresponding termination command to the slave as a synchronization signal. The slave driver will update new data (if exist) onto the DMA upon seeing the termination command.\\n\\nThe termination command is WR_DONE (0x07) for WRDMA and CMD8 (0x08) for RDDMA.\\n\\nHere is an example for the flow the master read data from the slave DMA:\\n\\n1. The slave loads 4092 bytes of data onto the RDDMA.\\n2. The master do seven RDDMA transactions, each of them is 512 bytes long, and reads the first 3584 bytes from the slave.\\n3. The master do the last RDDMA transaction of 512 bytes (equal, longer, or shorter than the total length loaded by the slave are all allowed). The first 508 bytes are valid data from the slave, while the last 4 bytes are meaningless bytes.\\n4. The master sends CMD8 to the slave.\\n5. The slave loads another 4092 bytes of data onto the RDDMA.\\n6. The master can start new reading transactions after it sends the CMD8.\\n',\n",

       " 'Documenting Code\\n================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThe purpose of this description is to provide a quick summary of the documentation style used in `espressif/esp-idf`_ repository and how to add new documentation.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nWhen documenting code for this repository, please follow `Doxygen style <https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html#specialblock>`_. You are doing it by inserting special commands, for instance ``@param``, into standard comments blocks, for example: ::\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @param ratio this is oxygen to air ratio\\n     */\\n\\nDoxygen can phrase the code, extract the commands together with subsequent text, and build documentation out of it.\\n\\nTypical comment block, that contains documentation of a function, looks like below:\\n\\n.. image:: ../../_static/doc-code-documentation-inline.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Sample inline code documentation\\n\\nDoxygen supports a couple of formatting styles. It also gives you great flexibility on the level of details to include in documentation. To get familiar with available features, please check data-rich and very well-organized `Doxygen Manual <https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/index.html>`_.\\n\\n\\nWhy We Need Doxygen?\\n--------------------\\n\\nThe ultimate goal is to ensure that all the code is consistently documented, so we can use tools like `Sphinx`_ and `Breathe`_ to aid preparation and automatic updates of API documentation when the code changes.\\n\\nWith these tools, the above piece of code renders like below:\\n\\n.. image:: ../../_static/doc-code-documentation-rendered.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Sample inline code after rendering\\n\\n\\nGo for It!\\n----------\\n\\nWhen writing code for this repository, please follow guidelines below:\\n\\n1. Document all building blocks of code, including functions, structs, typedefs, enums, macros, etc. Provide enough information about purpose, functionality, and limitations of documented items, as you would like to see them documented when reading the code by others.\\n\\n2. Documentation of function should describe what this function does. If it accepts input parameters and returns some value, all of them should be explained.\\n\\n3. Do not add a data type before parameter or any other characters besides spaces. All spaces and line breaks are compressed into a single space. If you like to break a line, then break it twice.\\n\\n    .. image:: ../../_static/doc-code-function.png\\n        :align: center\\n        :alt: Sample function documented inline and after rendering\\n\\n4. If function has void input or does not return any value, then skip ``@param`` or ``@return``.\\n\\n    .. image:: ../../_static/doc-code-void-function.png\\n        :align: center\\n        :alt: Sample void function documented inline and after rendering\\n\\n5. When documenting a ``define`` as well as members of a ``struct`` or ``enum``, place specific comment like below after each member.\\n\\n    .. image:: ../../_static/doc-code-member.png\\n        :align: center\\n        :alt: Sample of member documentation inline and after rendering\\n\\n6. To provide well-formatted lists, break the line after command (like ``@return`` in the example below). ::\\n\\n    *\\n    * @return\\n    *    - ESP_OK if erase operation was successful\\n    *    - ESP_ERR_NVS_INVALID_HANDLE if handle has been closed or is NULL\\n    *    - ESP_ERR_NVS_READ_ONLY if handle was opened as read only\\n    *    - ESP_ERR_NVS_NOT_FOUND if the requested key does not exist\\n    *    - other error codes from the underlying storage driver\\n    *\\n\\n7. Overview of functionality of documented header file, or group of files that make a library, should be placed in a separate ``README.rst`` file of the same directory. If this directory contains header files for different APIs, then the file name should be ``apiname-readme.rst``.\\n\\n\\nGo One Extra Mile\\n-----------------\\n\\nHere are a couple of tips on how you can make your documentation even better and more useful to the reader and writer.\\n\\nWhen writing code, please follow the guidelines below:\\n\\n1. Add code snippets to illustrate implementation. To do so, enclose snippet using ``@code{c}`` and ``@endcode`` commands. ::\\n\\n    *\\n    * @code{c}\\n    * // Example of using nvs_get_i32:\\n    * int32_t max_buffer_size = 4096; // default value\\n    * esp_err_t err = nvs_get_i32(my_handle, \"max_buffer_size\", &max_buffer_size);\\n    * assert(err == ESP_OK || err == ESP_ERR_NVS_NOT_FOUND);\\n    * // if ESP_ERR_NVS_NOT_FOUND was returned, max_buffer_size will still\\n    * // have its default value.\\n    * @endcode\\n    *\\n\\n   The code snippet should be enclosed in a comment block of the function that it illustrates.\\n\\n2. To highlight some important information use command ``@attention`` or ``@note``. ::\\n\\n    *\\n    * @attention\\n    *     1. This API only impact WIFI_MODE_STA or WIFI_MODE_APSTA mode\\n    *     2. If the ESP32 is connected to an AP, call esp_wifi_disconnect to disconnect.\\n    *\\n\\n   Above example also shows how to use a numbered list.\\n\\n3. To provide common description to a group of similar functions, enclose them using ``/**@{*/`` and ``/**@}*/`` markup commands. ::\\n\\n    /**@{*/\\n    /**\\n     * @brief common description of similar functions\\n     *\\n     */\\n    void  first_similar_function (void);\\n    void second_similar_function (void);\\n    /**@}*/\\n\\n   For practical example see :component_file:`nvs_flash/include/nvs.h`.\\n\\n4. You may want to go even further and skip some code like repetitive defines or enumerations. In such case, enclose the code within ``/** @cond */`` and ``/** @endcond */`` commands. Example of such implementation is provided in :component_file:`esp_driver_gpio/include/driver/gpio.h`.\\n\\n5. Use markdown to make your documentation even more readable. You will add headers, links, tables and more. ::\\n\\n    *\\n    * [{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual]({IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL})\\n    *\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Code snippets, notes, links, etc., will not make it to the documentation, if not enclosed in a comment block associated with one of the documented objects.\\n\\n6. Prepare one or more complete code examples together with description. Place description to a separate file ``README.md`` in specific folder of :idf:`examples` directory.\\n\\nStandardize Document Format\\n---------------------------\\n\\nWhen it comes to text, please follow guidelines below to provide well-formatted Markdown (.md) or reST (.rst) documents.\\n\\n1. Please ensure that one paragraph is written in one line. Do not break lines like below. Breaking lines to enhance readability is only suitable for writing code. To make the text easier to read, it is recommended to place an empty line to separate the paragraph.\\n\\n    .. figure:: ../../_static/doc-format1-recommend.png\\n        :align: center\\n        :scale: 20%\\n        :alt: One line for one paragraph - recommend (click to enlarge)\\n\\n        One line for one paragraph (click to enlarge)\\n\\n    .. figure:: ../../_static/doc-format2-notrecommend.png\\n        :align: center\\n        :scale: 20%\\n        :alt: One line for one paragraph - not recommend (click to enlarge)\\n\\n        No line breaks within the same paragraph (click to enlarge)\\n\\n2. Please make the line number of CN and EN documents consistent like below. The benefit of this approach is that it can save time for both writers and translators. When non-bilingual writers need to update text, they only need to update the same line in the corresponding CN or EN document. For translators, if documents are updated in English, then translators can quickly locate where to update in the corresponding CN document later. Besides, by comparing the total number of lines in EN and CN documents, you can quickly find out whether the CN version lags behind the EN version.\\n\\n    .. figure:: ../../_static/doc-format3-recommend.png\\n        :align: center\\n        :scale: 40%\\n        :alt: Keep the line number for EN and CN files consistent (click to enlarge)\\n\\n        Keep the line number for EN and CN documents consistent (click to enlarge)\\n\\nBuilding Documentation\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe documentation is built with the `esp-docs` Python package, which is a wrapper around `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_.\\n\\nTo install it simply do::\\n\\n    pip install esp-docs\\n\\nAfter a successful install then the documentation can be built from the docs folder with::\\n\\n    build-docs build\\n\\nor for specific target and language with::\\n\\n    build-docs -t esp32 -l en build\\n\\nFor more in-depth documentation about `esp-docs` features please see the documentation at `esp-docs <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-docs/en/latest/>`_.\\n\\nWrap Up\\n-------\\n\\nWe love good code that is doing cool things. We love it even better, if it is well-documented, so we can quickly make it run and also do the cool things.\\n\\nGo ahead, contribute your code and documentation!\\n\\nRelated Documents\\n-----------------\\n\\n* :doc:`../api-reference/template`\\n\\n\\n.. _espressif/esp-idf: https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/\\n\\n.. _interactive shell: http://interactive.blockdiag.com/?compression=deflate&src=eJxlUMFOwzAMvecrrO3aITYQQirlAIIzEseJQ5q4TUSIq8TVGIh_J2m7jbKc7Ge_5_dSO1Lv2soWvoVYgieNoMh7VGzJR9FJtugZ7lYQ0UcKEbYNOY36rRQHZHUPT68vV5tceGLbWCUzPfeaFFMoBZzecVc56vWwJFnWMmJ59CCZg617xpOFbTSyw0pmvT_HJ7hxtFNGBr6wvuu5SCkchcrZ1vAeXZomznh5YgTqfcpR02cBO6vZVDeXBRjMjKEcFRbLh8f18-Z2UUBDnqP9wmp9ncRmSSfND2ldGo2h_zse407g0Mxc1q7HzJ3-4jzYYTJjtQH3iSV-fgFzx50J\\n\\n.. _Breathe: https://breathe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\\n',\n",

For further information please refer to :doc:`the list of copyrights and licenses <../../../COPYRIGHT>`.\\n\\nThis page explains how the source code should be properly marked with a copyright header. ESP-IDF uses the `Software Package Data Exchange (SPDX) <https://spdx.dev>`_ format which is short and can be easily read by humans or processed by automated tools for copyright checks.\\n\\nHow to Check the Copyright Headers\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nPlease make sure you have installed the :doc:`pre-commit hooks <install-pre-commit-hook>` which contain a copyright header checker as well. The checker can suggest a header if it is not able to detect a properly formatted SPDX header.\\n\\nWhat If the Checker\\'s Suggestion Is Incorrect?\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nNo automated checker (no matter how good is) can replace humans. So the developer\\'s responsibility is to modify the offered header to be in line with the law and the license restrictions of the original code on which the work is based on. Certain licenses are not compatible between each other. Such corner cases will be covered by the following examples.\\n\\nThe checker can be configured with the ``tools/ci/check_copyright_config.yaml`` configuration file. Please check the options it offers and consider updating it in order to match the headers correctly.\\n\\nCommon Examples of Copyright Headers\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nThe simplest case is when the code is not based on any licensed previous work, e.g., it was written completely from scratch. Such code can be decorated with the following copyright header and put under the license of ESP-IDF::\\n\\n    /*\\n     * SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2015-2023 Espressif Systems (Shanghai) CO LTD\\n     *\\n     * SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\\n     */\\n\\nLess Restrictive Parts of ESP-IDF\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nSome parts of ESP-IDF are deliberately under less restrictive licenses in order to ease their re-use in commercial closed source projects. This is the case for :project:`ESP-IDF examples <examples>` which are in Public domain or under the Creative Commons Zero Universal (CC0) license. The following header can be used in such source files::\\n\\n    /*\\n     * SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2015-2023 Espressif Systems (Shanghai) CO LTD\\n     *\\n     * SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense OR CC0-1.0\\n     */\\n\\nThe option allowing multiple licenses joined with the ``OR`` keyword from the above example can be achieved with the definition of multiple allowed licenses in the ``tools/ci/check_copyright_config.yaml`` configuration file. Please use this option with care and only selectively for a limited part of ESP-IDF.\\n\\nThird Party Licenses\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nCode licensed under different licenses, modified by Espressif Systems and included in ESP-IDF cannot be licensed under Apache License 2.0 not even if the checker suggests it. It is advised to keep the original copyright header and add an SPDX before it.\\n\\nThe following example is a suitable header for a code licensed under the \"GNU General Public License v2.0 or later\" held by John Doe with some additional modifications done by Espressif Systems::\\n\\n    /*\\n     * SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 1991 John Doe\\n     *\\n     * SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later\\n     *\\n     * SPDX-FileContributor: 2019-2023 Espressif Systems (Shanghai) CO LTD\\n     */\\n\\nThe licenses can be identified and the short SPDX identifiers can be found in the official `SPDX license list`_. Other very common licenses are the GPL-2.0-only, the BSD-3-Clause, and the BSD-2-Clause.\\n\\nIn exceptional case, when a license is not present on the `SPDX license list`_, it can be expressed by using the `LicenseRef-[idString]`_ custom license identifier, for example ``LicenseRef-Special-License``. The full license text must be added into the ``LICENSES`` directory under ``Special-License`` filename. ::\\n\\n    /*\\n     * SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2015-2023 Espressif Systems (Shanghai) CO LTD\\n     *\\n     * SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-Special-License\\n     */\\n\\nDedicated ``LicenseRef-Included`` custom license identifier can be used to express a situation when the custom license is included directly in the source file. ::\\n\\n    /*\\n     * SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2015-2023 Espressif Systems (Shanghai) CO LTD\\n     *\\n     * SPDX-License-Identifier: LicenseRef-Included\\n     *\\n     * <Full custom license text>\\n     */\\n\\nThe configuration stored in ``tools/ci/check_copyright_config.yaml`` offers features useful for third party licenses:\\n\\n* A different license can be defined for the files part of a third party library.\\n* The check for a selected set of files can be permanently disabled. Please use this option with care and only in cases when none of the other options are suitable.\\n\\n.. _SPDX license list: https://spdx.org/licenses\\n.. _LicenseRef-[idString]: https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.3/other-licensing-information-detected/#101-license-identifier-field\\n',\n",

Examples should demonstrate ESP-IDF functionality, while keeping this purpose in mind.\\n\\nStructure\\n---------\\n\\n- The ``main`` directory should contain a source file named ``(something)_example_main.c`` with the main functionality.\\n- If the example has additional functionality, split it logically into separate C or C++ source files under ``main`` and place a corresponding header file in the same directory.\\n- If the example has a lot of additional functionality, consider adding a ``components`` directory to the example project and make some example-specific components with library functionality. Only do this if the components are specific to the example, if they are generic or common functionality then they should be added to ESP-IDF itself.\\n- The example should have a ``README.md`` file. Use the :idf_file:`template example README <docs/TEMPLATE_EXAMPLE_README.md>` and adapt it for your particular example.\\n- Examples should have a ``pytest_<example name>.py`` file for running an automated example test.

       " '===============================\\nESP-IDF Tests with Pytest Guide\\n===============================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nESP-IDF provides a variety of testing mechanisms that runs directly on target ESP chips (referred to as **target test**). These target tests are typically integrated into an ESP-IDF project specifically designed for testing purposes (known as a **test app**). Similar to standard ESP-IDF projects, test apps follow the same build, flash, and monitoring procedures.\\n\\nIn target testing, a connected host (for instance, a PC) is typically required to trigger specific test cases, provide test data, and evaluate test results.\\n\\nOn the host side, ESP-IDF employs the pytest framework (alongside certain pytest plugins) to automate target testing. This guide delves into pytest in ESP-IDF, covering the following aspects:\\n\\n1. Common concepts in ESP-IDF target testing.\\n2. Using the pytest framework in Python scripts for target testing automation.\\n3. ESP-IDF Continuous Integration (CI) target testing workflow.\\n4. Running target tests locally using pytest.\\n5. pytest tips and tricks.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  In ESP-IDF, we use the following pytest plugins by default:\\n\\n  - `pytest-embedded <https://github.com/espressif/pytest-embedded>`__ with default services ``esp,idf``\\n  - `pytest-rerunfailures <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-rerunfailures>`__\\n  - `pytest-ignore-test-results <https://github.com/espressif/pytest-ignore-test-results>`__\\n\\n  All the concepts and usages introduced in this guide are based on the default behavior of these plugins, thus may not be available in vanilla pytest.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n  This guide specifically targets ESP-IDF contributors. Some of the concepts, like the custom markers, may not be directly applicable to personal projects using the ESP-IDF SDK. For running pytest-embedded in personal projects, please refer to `pytest-embedded documentation <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/pytest-embedded>`__, and explore the `provided examples <https://github.com/espressif/pytest-embedded/tree/main/examples/esp-idf>`__.\\n\\nInstallation\\n============\\n\\nAll dependencies could be installed by running the install script with the ``--enable-pytest`` argument:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  $ install.sh --enable-pytest\\n\\nWe have implemented several mechanisms to ensure the successful execution of all installation processes. If you encounter any issues during the installation, please submit an issue report to our `GitHub issue tracker <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues>`__.\\n\\nCommon Concepts\\n===============\\n\\nA **test app** is a set of binaries which is being built from an IDF project that is used to test a particular feature of your project. Test apps are usually located under ``${IDF_PATH}/examples``, ``${IDF_PATH}/tools/test_apps``, and ``${IDF_PATH}/components/<COMPONENT_NAME>/test_apps``.\\n\\nA **Device under test (DUT)** is a set of ESP chip(s) which connect to a host (e.g., a PC). The host is responsible for flashing the apps to the DUT, triggering the test cases, and inspecting the test results.\\n\\nA typical ESP-IDF project that contains a pytest script will have the following structure:\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n  .\\n  └── my_app/\\n      ├── main/\\n      │   └── ...\\n      ├── CMakeLists.txt\\n      └── pytest_foo.py\\n\\nSometimes, for some multi-dut tests, one test case requires multiple test apps. In this case, the test app folder structure would be like this:\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n  .\\n  ├── my_app_foo/\\n  │   ├── main/\\n  │   │   └── ...\\n  │   └── CMakeLists.txt\\n  ├── my_app_bar/\\n  │   ├── main/\\n  │   │   └── ...\\n  │   └── CMakeLists.txt\\n  └── pytest_foo_bar.py\\n\\npytest in ESP-IDF\\n=================\\n\\nSingle DUT Test Cases\\n---------------------\\n\\nGetting Started\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n  @pytest.mark.esp32\\n  @pytest.mark.esp32s2\\n  @pytest.mark.generic\\n  def test_hello_world(dut) -> None:\\n      dut.expect(\\'Hello world!\\')\\n\\nThis is a simple test script that could run with our getting-started example :example:`get-started/hello_world`.\\n\\nFirst two lines are the target markers:\\n\\n* The ``@pytest.mark.esp32`` is a marker that indicates that this test case should be run on the ESP32.\\n* The ``@pytest.mark.esp32s2`` is a marker that indicates that this test case should be run on the ESP32-S2.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  If the test case can be run on all targets officially supported by ESP-IDF (call ``idf.py --list-targets`` for more details), you can use a special marker ``supported_targets`` to apply all of them in one line.\\n\\n  We also supports ``preview_targets`` and ``all_targets`` as special target markers (call ``idf.py --list-targets --preview`` for a full targets list including preview targets).\\n\\nNext, we have the environment marker:\\n\\n* The ``@pytest.mark.generic`` is a marker that indicates that this test case should be run on the ``generic`` board type.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  For the detailed explanation of the environment markers, please refer to :idf_file:`ENV_MARKERS definition <tools/ci/idf_pytest/constants.py>`\\n\\nFinally, we have the test function. With a ``dut`` fixture. In single-dut test cases, the ``dut`` fixture is an instance of ``IdfDut`` class, for multi-dut test cases, it is a tuple of ``IdfDut`` instances. For more details regarding the ``IdfDut`` class, please refer to `pytest-embedded IdfDut API reference <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/pytest-embedded/en/latest/api.html#pytest_embedded_idf.dut.IdfDut>`__.\\n\\nSame App with Different sdkconfig Files\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFor some test cases, you may need to run the same app with different sdkconfig files. For detailed documentation regarding sdkconfig related concepts, please refer to `idf-build-apps Documentation <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/idf-build-apps/en/latest/find_build.html>`__.\\n\\nHere\\'s a simple example that demonstrates how to run the same app with different sdkconfig files. Assume we have the following folder structure:\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n  .\\n  └── my_app/\\n      ├── main/\\n      │   └── ...\\n      ├── CMakeLists.txt\\n      ├── sdkconfig.ci.foo\\n      ├── sdkconfig.ci.bar\\n      └── pytest_foo.py\\n\\nIf the test case needs to run all supported targets with these two sdkconfig files, you can use the following code:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n  @pytest.mark.esp32\\n  @pytest.mark.esp32s2\\n  @pytest.mark.parametrize(\\'config\\', [    # <-- parameterize the sdkconfig file\\n      \\'foo\\',                              # <-- run with sdkconfig.ci.foo\\n      \\'bar\\',                              # <-- run with sdkconfig.ci.bar\\n  ], indirect=True)                       # <-- `indirect=True` is required, indicates this param is pre-calculated before other fixtures\\n  def test_foo_bar(dut, config) -> None:\\n      if config == \\'foo\\':\\n        dut.expect(\\'This is from sdkconfig.ci.foo\\')\\n      elif config == \\'bar\\':\\n        dut.expect(\\'This is from sdkconfig.ci.bar\\')\\n\\nAll markers will impact the test case simultaneously. Overall, this test function would be replicated to 4 test cases:\\n\\n- ``test_foo_bar``, with esp32 target, and sdkconfig.ci.foo as the sdkconfig file\\n- ``test_foo_bar``, with esp32 target, and sdkconfig.ci.bar as the sdkconfig file\\n- ``test_foo_bar``, with esp32s2 target, and sdkconfig.ci.foo as the sdkconfig file\\n- ``test_foo_bar``, with esp32s2 target, and sdkconfig.ci.bar as the sdkconfig file\\n\\nSometimes in the test script or the log file, you may see the following format:\\n\\n- ``esp32.foo.test_foo_bar``\\n- ``esp32.bar.test_foo_bar``\\n- ``esp32s2.foo.test_foo_bar``\\n- ``esp32s2.bar.test_foo_bar``\\n\\nWe call this format the **test case ID**. The test case ID should be considered as the unique identifier of a test case. It is composed of the following parts:\\n\\n- ``esp32``: the target name\\n- ``foo``: the config name\\n- ``test_foo_bar``: the test function name\\n\\nThe test case ID is used to identify the test case in the JUnit report.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  Nearly all the CLI options of pytest-embedded supports parameterization. To see all supported CLI options, you may run ``pytest --help`` and check the ``embedded-...`` sections for vanilla pytest-embedded ones, and the ``idf`` sections for ESP-IDF specific ones.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  The target markers, like ``@pytest.mark.esp32`` and ``@pytest.mark.esp32s2``, are actually syntactic sugar for parameterization. In fact they are defined as:\\n\\n  .. code-block:: python\\n\\n    @pytest.mark.parametrize(\\'target\\', [\\n        \\'esp32\\',\\n        \\'esp32s2\\',\\n    ], indirect=True)\\n\\nSame App with Different sdkconfig Files, Different Targets\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFor some test cases, you may need to run the same app with different sdkconfig files. These sdkconfig files supports different targets. We may use ``pytest.param`` to achieve this. Let\\'s use the same folder structure as above.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n  @pytest.mark.parametrize(\\'config\\', [\\n      pytest.param(\\'foo\\', marks=[pytest.mark.esp32]),\\n      pytest.param(\\'bar\\', marks=[pytest.mark.esp32s2]),\\n  ], indirect=True)\\n\\nNow this test function would be replicated to 2 test cases (represented as test case IDs):\\n\\n* ``esp32.foo.test_foo_bar``\\n* ``esp32s2.bar.test_foo_bar``\\n\\nTesting Serial Output (Expecting)\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nTo ensure that test has executed successfully on target, the test script can test that serial output of the target using the ``dut.expect()`` function, for example:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n  def test_hello_world(dut) -> None:\\n      dut.expect(\\'\\\\d+\\')  # <-- `expect`ing from a regex\\n      dut.expect_exact(\\'Hello world!\\')  # <-- `expect_exact`ly the string\\n\\nThe ``dut.expect(...)`` will first compile the expected string into regex, which in turn is then used to seek through the serial output until the compiled regex is matched, or until a timeout occurs.\\n\\nPlease pay extra attention to the expected string when it contains regex keyword characters (e.g., parentheses, square brackets). Alternatively, you may use ``dut.expect_exact(...)`` that will attempt to match the string without converting it into regex.\\n\\nFor more information regarding the different types of ``expect`` functions, please refer to the `pytest-embedded Expecting documentation <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/pytest-embedded/en/latest/expecting.html>`__.\\n\\nMulti-DUT Test Cases\\n--------------------\\n\\nMulti-Target Tests with the Same App\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn some cases a test may involve multiple targets running the same test app. Parametrize ``count`` to the number of DUTs you want to test with.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n  @pytest.mark.parametrize(\\'count\\', [\\n      2,\\n  ], indirect=True)\\n  @pytest.mark.parametrize(\\'target\\', [\\n    \\'esp32|esp32s2\\',\\n    \\'esp32s3\\',\\n  ], indirect=True)\\n  def test_hello_world(dut) -> None:\\n      dut[0].expect(\\'Hello world!\\')\\n      dut[1].expect(\\'Hello world!\\')\\n\\nThe ``|`` symbol in all parametrized items is used for separating the settings for each DUT. In this example, the test case would be tested with:\\n\\n* esp32, esp32s2\\n* esp32s3, esp32s3\\n\\nAfter setting the param ``count`` to 2, all the fixtures are changed into tuples.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n  ``count`` is mandatory for multi-DUT tests.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  For detailed multi-dut parametrization documentation, please refer to `pytest-embedded Multi-DUT documentation <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/pytest-embedded/en/latest/key_concepts.html#multi-duts>`__.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n  In some test scripts, you may see target markers like ``@pytest.mark.esp32`` and ``@pytest.mark.esp32s2`` used together with multi-DUT test cases. This is deprecated and should be replaced with the ``target`` parametrization.\\n\\n  For example,\\n\\n  .. code-block:: python\\n\\n    @pytest.mark.esp32\\n    @pytest.mark.esp32s2\\n    @pytest.mark.parametrize(\\'count\\', [\\n        2,\\n    ], indirect=True)\\n    def test_hello_world(dut) -> None:\\n        dut[0].expect(\\'Hello world!\\')\\n        dut[1].expect(\\'Hello world!\\')\\n\\n  should be replaced with:\\n\\n  .. code-block:: python\\n\\n    @pytest.mark.parametrize(\\'count\\', [\\n        2,\\n    ], indirect=True)\\n    @pytest.mark.parametrize(\\'target\\', [\\n        \\'esp32\\',\\n        \\'esp32s2\\',\\n    ], indirect=True)\\n    def test_hello_world(dut) -> None:\\n        dut[0].expect(\\'Hello world!\\')\\n        dut[1].expect(\\'Hello world!\\')\\n\\n  This could help avoid the ambiguity of the target markers when multi-DUT test cases are using different type of targets.\\n\\nMulti-Target Tests with Different Apps\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn some cases, a test may involve multiple targets running different test apps (e.g., separate targets to act as master and slave). Usually in ESP-IDF, the folder structure would be like this:\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n  .\\n  ├── master/\\n  │   ├── main/\\n  │   │   └── ...\\n  │   └── CMakeLists.txt\\n  ├── slave/\\n  │   ├── main/\\n  │   │   └── ...\\n  │   └── CMakeLists.txt\\n  └── pytest_master_slave.py\\n\\nIn this case, we can parametrize the ``app_path`` to the path of the test apps you want to test with.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    @pytest.mark.multi_dut_generic\\n    @pytest.mark.parametrize(\\'count\\', [\\n        2,\\n    ], indirect=True)\\n    @pytest.mark.parametrize(\\'app_path, target\\', [\\n        (f\\'{os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"master\")}|{os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"slave\")}\\', \\'esp32|esp32s2\\'),\\n        (f\\'{os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"master\")}|{os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"slave\")}\\', \\'esp32s2|esp32\\'),\\n    ], indirect=True)\\n    def test_master_slave(dut) -> None:\\n        master = dut[0]\\n        slave = dut[1]\\n\\n        master.write(\\'Hello world!\\')\\n        slave.expect_exact(\\'Hello world!\\')\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  When parametrizing two items, like ``app_path, target`` here, make sure you\\'re passing a list of tuples to the ``parametrize`` decorator. Each tuple should contain the values for each item.\\n\\nThe test case here will be replicated to 2 test cases:\\n\\n* dut-0, an ESP32, running app ``master``, and dut-1, an ESP32-S2, running app ``slave``\\n* dut-0, an ESP32-S2, running app ``master``, and dut-1, an ESP32, running app ``slave``\\n\\nTest Cases with Unity Test Framework\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nWe use `Unity test framework <https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity>`__ in our unit tests. Overall, we have three types of test cases (`Unity test framework <https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Unity>`__):\\n\\n* Normal test cases (single DUT)\\n* Multi-stage test cases (single DUT)\\n* Multi-device test cases (multi-DUT)\\n\\nAll single-DUT test cases (including normal test cases and multi-stage test cases) can be run using the following command:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n  def test_unity_single_dut(dut: IdfDut):\\n      dut.run_all_single_board_cases()\\n\\nUsing this command will skip all the test cases containing the ``[ignore]`` tag.\\n\\nIf you need to run a group of test cases, you may run:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n  def test_unity_single_dut(dut: IdfDut):\\n      dut.run_all_single_board_cases(group=\\'psram\\')\\n\\nIt would trigger all test cases with the ``[psram]`` tag.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n  You may also see that there are some test scripts with the following statements, which are deprecated. Please use the suggested one as above.\\n\\n  .. code-block:: python\\n\\n    def test_unity_single_dut(dut: IdfDut):\\n        dut.expect_exact(\\'Press ENTER to see the list of tests\\')\\n        dut.write(\\'*\\')\\n        dut.expect_unity_test_output()\\n\\nWe also provide a fixture ``case_tester`` to trigger all kinds of test cases easier. For example:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n  def test_unity_single_dut(case_tester):\\n      case_tester.run_all_normal_cases()       # to run all normal test cases\\n      case_tester.run_all_multi_dev_cases()    # to run all multi-device test cases\\n      case_tester.run_all_multi_stage_cases()  # to run all multi-stage test cases\\n\\nFor a full list of the available functions, please refer to `pytest-embedded case_tester API reference <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/pytest-embedded/en/latest/api.html#pytest_embedded_idf.unity_tester.CaseTester>`__.\\n\\nRunning Target Tests in CI\\n==========================\\n\\nThe workflow in CI is as follows:\\n\\n.. blockdiag::\\n    :caption: Target Test Child Pipeline Workflow\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    blockdiag child-pipeline-workflow {\\n        default_group_color = lightgray;\\n\\n        group {\\n            label = \"build\"\\n\\n            build_test_related_apps; build_non_test_related_apps;\\n        }\\n\\n        group {\\n            label = \"assign_test\"\\n\\n            build_job_report; generate_pytest_child_pipeline;\\n        }\\n\\n        group {\\n            label = \"target_test\"\\n\\n            \"Specific Target Test Jobs\";\\n        }\\n\\n        group {\\n            label = \".post\"\\n\\n            target_test_report;\\n        }\\n\\n        build_test_related_apps, build_non_test_related_apps -> generate_pytest_child_pipeline, build_job_report -> \"Specific Target Test Jobs\" -> target_test_report;\\n    }\\n\\nAll build jobs and target test jobs are generated automatically by our CI script :project:`tools/ci/dynamic_pipelines`.\\n\\nBuild Jobs\\n----------\\n\\nIn CI, all ESP-IDF projects under ``components``, ``examples``, and ``tools/test_apps``, are built with all supported targets and sdkconfig files. The binaries are built under ``build_<target>_<config>``. For example\\n\\n.. code-block:: text\\n\\n  .\\n  ├── build_esp32_history/\\n  │   └── ...\\n  ├── build_esp32_nohistory/\\n  │   └── ...\\n  ├── build_esp32s2_history/\\n  │   └── ...\\n  ├── ...\\n  ├── main/\\n  ├── CMakeLists.txt\\n  ├── sdkconfig.ci.history\\n  ├── sdkconfig.ci.nohistory\\n  └── ...\\n\\nThere are two types of build jobs, ``build_test_related_apps`` and ``build_non_test_related_apps``.\\n\\nFor ``build_test_related_apps``, all the built binaries will be uploaded to our internal MinIO server. You may find the download link in the build report posted in the internal MR.\\n\\nFor ``build_non_test_related_apps``, all the built binaries will be removed after the build job is finished. Only the build log files will be uploaded to our internal MinIO server. You may also find the download link in the build report posted in the internal MR.\\n\\nTarget Test Jobs\\n----------------\\n\\nIn CI, all generated target test jobs are named according to the pattern \"<targets> - <env_markers>\". For example, single-dut test job ``esp32 - generic``, or multi-dut test job ``esp32,esp32 - multi_dut_generic``.\\n\\nThe binaries in the target test jobs are downloaded from our internal MinIO servers. For most of the test cases, only the files that are required by flash (like .bin files, flash_args files, etc) would be downloaded. For some test cases, like jtag test cases, .elf files are also downloaded.\\n\\nRunning Tests Locally\\n=====================\\n\\nInstallation\\n------------\\n\\nFirst you need to install ESP-IDF with additional Python requirements:\\n\\n.. code-block:: shell\\n\\n  $ cd $IDF_PATH\\n  $ bash install.sh --enable-ci --enable-pytest\\n  $ . ./export.sh\\n\\nBuild Directories\\n-----------------\\n\\nBy default, each test case looks for the required binary files in the following directories (in order):\\n\\n- ``build_<target>_<sdkconfig>``\\n- ``build_<target>``\\n- ``build_<sdkconfig>``\\n- ``build``\\n\\nAs long as one of the above directories exists, the test case uses that directory to flash the binaries. If non of the above directories exists, the test case fails with an error.\\n\\nTest Your Test Script\\n---------------------\\n\\nSingle-DUT Test Cases with ``sdkconfig.defaults``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThis is the simplest use case. Let\\'s take :project:`examples/get-started/hello_world` as an example. Assume we\\'re testing with a ESP32 board.\\n\\n.. code-block:: shell\\n\\n  $ cd $IDF_PATH/examples/get-started/hello_world\\n  $ idf.py set-target esp32 build\\n  $ pytest --target esp32\\n\\nSingle-DUT Test Cases with ``sdkconfig.ci.xxx``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSome test cases may need to run with different sdkconfig files. Let\\'s take :project:`examples/system/console/basic` as an example. Assume we\\'re testing with a ESP32 board, and test with ``sdkconfig.ci.history``.\\n\\n.. code-block:: shell\\n\\n  $ cd $IDF_PATH/examples/system/console/basic\\n  $ idf.py -DSDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=\\'sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig.ci.history\\' -B build_esp32_history set-target esp32 build\\n  $ pytest --target esp32 -k \"not nohistory\"\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Here if we use ``pytest --target esp32 -k history``, both test cases will be selected, since ``pytest -k`` will use string matching to filter the test cases.\\n\\nIf you want to build and test with all sdkconfig files at the same time, you should use our CI script as an helper script:\\n\\n.. code-block:: shell\\n\\n  $ cd $IDF_PATH/examples/system/console/basic\\n  $ python $IDF_PATH/tools/ci/ci_build_apps.py . --target esp32 -v --pytest-apps\\n  $ pytest --target esp32\\n\\nThe app with ``sdkconfig.ci.history`` will be built in ``build_esp32_history``, and the app with ``sdkconfig.ci.nohistory`` will be built in ``build_esp32_nohistory``. ``pytest --target esp32`` will run tests on both apps.\\n\\nMulti-DUT Test Cases\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nSome test cases may need to run with multiple DUTs. Let\\'s take :project:`examples/openthread` as an example. The test case function looks like this:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    @pytest.mark.parametrize(\\n        \\'config, count, app_path, target\\', [\\n            (\\'rcp|cli_h2|br\\', 3,\\n             f\\'{os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"ot_rcp\")}\\'\\n             f\\'|{os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"ot_cli\")}\\'\\n             f\\'|{os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), \"ot_br\")}\\',\\n             \\'esp32c6|esp32h2|esp32s3\\'),\\n        ],\\n        indirect=True,\\n    )\\n    def test_thread_connect(dut:Tuple[IdfDut, IdfDut, IdfDut]) -> None:\\n        ...\\n\\nThe test cases will run with\\n\\n- ESP32-C6, flashed with ``ot_rcp``\\n- ESP32-H2, flashed with ``ot_cli``\\n- ESP32-S3, flashed with ``ot_br``\\n\\nOf course we can build the required binaries manually, but we can also use our CI script as an helper script:\\n\\n.. code-block:: shell\\n\\n  $ cd $IDF_PATH/examples/openthread\\n  $ python $IDF_PATH/tools/ci/ci_build_apps.py . --target all -v --pytest-apps -k test_thread_connect\\n  $ pytest --target esp32c6,esp32h2,esp32s3 -k test_thread_connect\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n    It is mandatory to list all the targets for multi-DUT test cases. Otherwise, the test case would fail with an error.\\n\\nDebug CI Test Cases\\n-------------------\\n\\nSometimes you can\\'t reprocude the CI test case failure locally. In this case, you may need to debug the test case with the binaries built in CI.\\n\\nRun pytest with ``--pipeline-id <pipeline_id>`` to force pytest to download the binaries from CI. For example:\\n\\n.. code-block:: shell\\n\\n  $ cd $IDF_PATH/examples/get-started/hello_world\\n  $ pytest --target esp32 --pipeline-id 123456\\n\\nEven if you have ``build_esp32_default``, or ``build`` directory locally, pytest would still download the binaries from pipeline 123456 and place the binaries in ``build_esp32_default``. Then run the test case with this binary.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    <pipeline_id> should be the parent pipeline id. You can copy it in your MR page.\\n\\nPytest Tips and Tricks\\n======================\\n\\nCustom Classes\\n--------------\\n\\nUsually, you may want to write a custom class under these conditions:\\n\\n1. Add more reusable functions for a certain number of DUTs.\\n2. Add custom setup and teardown functions\\n\\nThis code example is taken from :idf_file:`panic/conftest.py <tools/test_apps/system/panic/conftest.py>`.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n  class PanicTestDut(IdfDut):\\n      ...\\n\\n  @pytest.fixture(scope=\\'module\\')\\n  def monkeypatch_module(request: FixtureRequest) -> MonkeyPatch:\\n      mp = MonkeyPatch()\\n      request.addfinalizer(mp.undo)\\n      return mp\\n\\n\\n  @pytest.fixture(scope=\\'module\\', autouse=True)\\n  def replace_dut_class(monkeypatch_module: MonkeyPatch) -> None:\\n      monkeypatch_module.setattr(\\'pytest_embedded_idf.dut.IdfDut\\', PanicTestDut)\\n\\n``monkeypatch_module`` provides a `module-scoped <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/fixtures.html#scope-sharing-fixtures-across-classes-modules-packages-or-session>`__ `monkeypatch <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/monkeypatch.html>`__ fixture.\\n\\n``replace_dut_class`` is a `module-scoped <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/fixtures.html#scope-sharing-fixtures-across-classes-modules-packages-or-session>`__ `autouse <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/fixtures.html#autouse-fixtures-fixtures-you-don-t-have-to-request>`__ fixture. This function replaces the ``IdfDut`` class with your custom class.\\n\\nMark Flaky Tests\\n----------------\\n\\nCertain test cases are based on Ethernet or Wi-Fi. However, the test may be flaky due to networking issues. Thus, it is possible to mark a particular test case as flaky.\\n\\nThis code example is taken from :idf_file:`pytest_esp_eth.py <components/esp_eth/test_apps/pytest_esp_eth.py>`.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n  @pytest.mark.flaky(reruns=3, reruns_delay=5)\\n  def test_esp_eth_ip101(dut: IdfDut) -> None:\\n      ...\\n\\nThis flaky marker means that if the test function failed, the test case would rerun for a maximum of 3 times with 5 seconds delay.\\n\\nMark Known Failures\\n-------------------\\n\\nSometimes, a test can consistently fail for the following reasons:\\n\\n- The feature under test (or the test itself) has a bug.\\n- The test environment is unstable (e.g., due to network issues) leading to a high failure ratio.\\n\\nNow you may mark this test case with marker `xfail <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/skipping.html#xfail-mark-test-functions-as-expected-to-fail>`__ with a user-friendly readable reason.\\n\\nThis code example is taken from :idf_file:`pytest_panic.py <tools/test_apps/system/panic/pytest_panic.py>`\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n  @pytest.mark.xfail(\\'config.getvalue(\"target\") == \"esp32s2\"\\', reason=\\'raised IllegalInstruction instead\\')\\n  def test_cache_error(dut: PanicTestDut, config: str, test_func_name: str) -> None:\\n\\nThis marker means that test is a known failure on the ESP32-S2.\\n\\nMark Nightly Run Test Cases\\n---------------------------\\n\\nSome test cases are only triggered in nightly run pipelines due to a lack of runners.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n  @pytest.mark.nightly_run\\n\\nThis marker means that the test case would only be run with env var ``NIGHTLY_RUN`` or ``INCLUDE_NIGHTLY_RUN``.\\n\\nMark Temporarily Disabled in CI\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nSome test cases which can pass locally may need to be temporarily disabled in CI due to a lack of runners.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n  @pytest.mark.temp_skip_ci(targets=[\\'esp32\\', \\'esp32s2\\'], reason=\\'lack of runners\\')\\n\\nThis marker means that the test case could still be run locally with ``pytest --target esp32``, but will not run in CI.\\n\\nAdd New Markers\\n---------------\\n\\nWe are using two types of custom markers, target markers which indicate that the test cases should support this target, and env markers which indicate that the test cases should be assigned to runners with these tags in CI.\\n\\nYou can add new markers by adding one line under the :idf_file:`conftest.py`. If it is a target marker, it should be added into ``TARGET_MARKERS``. If it is a marker that specifies a type of test environment, it should be added into ``ENV_MARKERS``. The syntax should be: ``<marker_name>: <marker_description>``.\\n\\nSkip Auto Flash Binary\\n----------------------\\n\\nSkipping auto-flash binary every time would be useful when you are debugging your test script.\\n\\nYou can call pytest with ``--skip-autoflash y`` to achieve it.\\n\\nRecord Statistics\\n-----------------\\n\\nSometimes you may need to record some statistics while running the tests, like the performance test statistics.\\n\\nYou can use `record_xml_attribute <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/output.html?highlight=junit#record-xml-attribute>`__ fixture in your test script, and the statistics would be recorded as attributes in the JUnit report.\\n\\nLogging System\\n--------------\\n\\nSometimes you may need to add some extra logging lines while running the test cases.\\n\\nYou can use `Python logging module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html>`__ to achieve this.\\n\\nHere are some logging functions provided as fixtures,\\n\\n``log_performance``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    def test_hello_world(\\n        dut: IdfDut,\\n        log_performance: Callable[[str, object], None],\\n    ) -> None:\\n        log_performance(\\'test\\', 1)\\n\\n\\nThe above example would log the performance item with pre-defined format: ``[performance][test]: 1`` and record it under the ``properties`` tag in the JUnit report if ``--junitxml <filepath>`` is specified. The JUnit test case node would look like:\\n\\n.. code-block:: html\\n\\n    <testcase classname=\"examples.get-started.hello_world.pytest_hello_world\" file=\"examples/get-started/hello_world/pytest_hello_world.py\" line=\"13\" name=\"esp32.default.test_hello_world\" time=\"8.389\">\\n        <properties>\\n            <property name=\"test\" value=\"1\"/>\\n        </properties>\\n    </testcase>\\n\\n``check_performance``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWe provide C macros ``TEST_PERFORMANCE_LESS_THAN`` and ``TEST_PERFORMANCE_GREATER_THAN`` to log the performance item and check if the value is in the valid range. Sometimes the performance item value could not be measured in C code, so we also provide a Python function for the same purpose. Please note that using C macros is the preferred approach, since the Python function could not recognize the threshold values of the same performance item under different ifdef blocks well.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n    def test_hello_world(\\n        dut: IdfDut,\\n        check_performance: Callable[[str, float, str], None],\\n    ) -> None:\\n        check_performance(\\'RSA_2048KEY_PUBLIC_OP\\', 123, \\'esp32\\')\\n        check_performance(\\'RSA_2048KEY_PUBLIC_OP\\', 19001, \\'esp32\\')\\n\\nThe above example would first get the threshold values of the performance item ``RSA_2048KEY_PUBLIC_OP`` from :idf_file:`components/idf_test/include/idf_performance.h` and the target-specific one :idf_file:`components/idf_test/include/esp32/idf_performance_target.h`, then check if the value reached the minimum limit or exceeded the maximum limit.\\n\\nLet us assume the value of ``IDF_PERFORMANCE_MAX_RSA_2048KEY_PUBLIC_OP`` is 19000. so the first ``check_performance`` line would pass and the second one would fail with warning: ``[Performance] RSA_2048KEY_PUBLIC_OP value is 19001, doesn\\\\\\'t meet pass standard 19000.0``.\\n\\nFurther Readings\\n================\\n\\n-  pytest documentation: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html\\n-  pytest-embedded documentation: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/pytest-embedded/en/latest/\\n',\n",
       " 'Espressif IoT Development Framework Style Guide\\n===============================================\\n\\n\\nAbout This Guide\\n----------------\\n\\nPurpose of this style guide is to encourage use of common coding practices within the ESP-IDF.\\n\\nStyle guide is a set of rules which are aimed to help create readable, maintainable, and robust code. By writing code which looks the same way across the code base we help others read and comprehend the code. By using same conventions for spaces and newlines we reduce chances that future changes will produce huge unreadable diffs. By following common patterns for module structure and by using language features consistently we help others understand code behavior.\\n\\nWe try to keep rules simple enough, which means that they can not cover all potential cases. In some cases one has to bend these simple rules to achieve readability, maintainability, or robustness.\\n\\nWhen doing modifications to third-party code used in ESP-IDF, follow the way that particular project is written. That will help propose useful changes for merging into upstream project.\\n\\nC Code Formatting\\n-----------------\\n\\n.. highlight:: c\\n\\n.. _style-guide-naming:\\n\\nNaming\\n^^^^^^\\n\\n* Any variable or function which is only used in a single source file should be declared ``static``.\\n* Public names (non-static variables and functions) should be namespaced with a per-component or per-unit prefix, to avoid naming collisions. ie ``esp_vfs_register()`` or ``esp_console_run()``. Starting the prefix with ``esp_`` for Espressif-specific names is optional, but should be consistent with any other names in the same component.\\n* Static variables should be prefixed with ``s_`` for easy identification. For example, ``static bool s_invert``.\\n* Avoid unnecessary abbreviations (ie shortening ``data`` to ``dat``), unless the resulting name would otherwise be very long.\\n\\n\\nIndentation\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nUse 4 spaces for each indentation level. Do not use tabs for indentation. Configure the editor to emit 4 spaces each time you press tab key.\\n\\nVertical Space\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nPlace one empty line between functions. Do not begin or end a function with an empty line.\\n::\\n\\n    void function1()\\n    {\\n        do_one_thing();\\n        do_another_thing();\\n                                    // INCORRECT, do not place empty line here\\n    }\\n                                    // place empty line here\\n    void function2()\\n    {\\n                                    // INCORRECT, do not use an empty line here\\n        int var = 0;\\n        while (var < SOME_CONSTANT) {\\n            do_stuff(&var);\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\nThe maximum line length is 120 characters as long as it does not seriously affect the readability.\\n\\nHorizontal Space\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAlways add single space after conditional and loop keywords::\\n\\n    if (condition) {    // correct\\n        // ...\\n    }\\n\\n    switch (n) {        // correct\\n        case 0:\\n            // ...\\n    }\\n\\n    for(int i = 0; i < CONST; ++i) {    // INCORRECT\\n        // ...\\n    }\\n\\nAdd single space around binary operators. No space is necessary for unary operators. It is okay to drop space around multiply and divide operators::\\n\\n    const int y = y0 + (x - x0) * (y1 - y0) / (x1 - x0);    // correct\\n\\n    const int y = y0 + (x - x0)*(y1 - y0)/(x1 - x0);        // also okay\\n\\n    int y_cur = -y;                                         // correct\\n    ++y_cur;\\n\\n    const int y = y0+(x-x0)*(y1-y0)/(x1-x0);                // INCORRECT\\n\\n\\nNo space is necessary around ``.`` and ``->`` operators.\\n\\n\\nSometimes adding horizontal space within a line can help make code more readable. For example, you can add space to align function arguments::\\n\\n    esp_rom_gpio_connect_in_signal(PIN_CAM_D6,   I2S0I_DATA_IN14_IDX, false);\\n    esp_rom_gpio_connect_in_signal(PIN_CAM_D7,   I2S0I_DATA_IN15_IDX, false);\\n    esp_rom_gpio_connect_in_signal(PIN_CAM_HREF, I2S0I_H_ENABLE_IDX,  false);\\n    esp_rom_gpio_connect_in_signal(PIN_CAM_PCLK, I2S0I_DATA_IN15_IDX, false);\\n\\nNote however that if someone goes to add new line with a longer identifier as first argument (e.g.,  ``PIN_CAM_VSYNC``), it will not fit. So other lines would have to be realigned, adding meaningless changes to the commit.\\n\\nTherefore, use horizontal alignment sparingly, especially if you expect new lines to be added to the list later.\\n\\nNever use TAB characters for horizontal alignment.\\n\\nNever add trailing whitespace at the end of the line.\\n\\n\\nBraces\\n^^^^^^\\n\\n- Function definition should have a brace on a separate line::\\n\\n    // This is correct:\\n    void function(int arg)\\n    {\\n\\n    }\\n\\n    // NOT like this:\\n    void function(int arg) {\\n\\n    }\\n\\n- Within a function, place opening brace on the same line with conditional and loop statements::\\n\\n    if (condition) {\\n        do_one();\\n    } else if (other_condition) {\\n        do_two();\\n    }\\n\\n\\nComments\\n^^^^^^^^\\n\\nUse ``//`` for single line comments. For multi-line comments it is okay to use either ``//`` on each line or a ``/* */`` block.\\n\\nAlthough not directly related to formatting, here are a few notes about using comments effectively.\\n\\n- Do not use single comments to disable some functionality::\\n\\n    void init_something()\\n    {\\n        setup_dma();\\n        // load_resources();                // WHY is this thing commented, asks the reader?\\n        start_timer();\\n    }\\n\\n- If some code is no longer required, remove it completely. If you need it you can always look it up in git history of this file. If you disable some call because of temporary reasons, with an intention to restore it in the future, add explanation on the adjacent line::\\n\\n    void init_something()\\n    {\\n        setup_dma();\\n        // TODO: we should load resources here, but loader is not fully integrated yet.\\n        // load_resources();\\n        start_timer();\\n    }\\n\\n- Same goes for ``#if 0 ... #endif`` blocks. Remove code block completely if it is not used. Otherwise, add comment explaining why the block is disabled. Do not use ``#if 0 ... #endif`` or comments to store code snippets which you may need in the future.\\n\\n- Do not add trivial comments about authorship and change date. You can always look up who modified any given line using git. E.g., this comment adds clutter to the code without adding any useful information::\\n\\n    void init_something()\\n    {\\n        setup_dma();\\n        // XXX add 2016-09-01\\n        init_dma_list();\\n        fill_dma_item(0);\\n        // end XXX add\\n        start_timer();\\n    }\\n\\n\\nLine Endings\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nCommits should only contain files with LF (Unix style) endings.\\n\\nWindows users can configure git to check out CRLF (Windows style) endings locally and commit LF endings by setting the ``core.autocrlf`` setting. `Github has a document about setting this option <github-line-endings>`.\\n\\nIf you accidentally have some commits in your branch that add LF endings, you can convert them to Unix by running this command in an MSYS2 or Unix terminal (change directory to the IDF working directory and check the correct branch is currently checked out, beforehand):\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  git rebase --exec \\'git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r HEAD | xargs dos2unix && git commit -a --amend --no-edit --allow-empty\\' master\\n\\n(Note that this line rebases on master, change the branch name at the end to rebase on another branch.)\\n\\nFor updating a single commit, it is possible to run ``dos2unix FILENAME`` and then run ``git commit --amend``\\n\\nFormatting Your Code\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-IDF uses Astyle to format source code. The configuration is stored in :project_file:`tools/ci/astyle-rules.yml` file.\\n\\nInitially, all components are excluded from formatting checks. You can enable formatting checks for the component by removing it from ``components_not_formatted_temporary`` list. Then run:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    pre-commit run --files <path_to_files> astyle_py\\n\\nAlternatively, you can run ``astyle_py`` manually. You can install it with ``pip install astyle_py==VERSION``. Make sure you have the same version installed as the one specified in :project_file:`.pre-commit-config.yaml` file. With ``astyle_py`` installed, run:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    astyle_py --rules=$IDF_PATH/tools/ci/astyle-rules.yml <path-to-file>\\n\\n\\nType Definitions\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nShould be snake_case, ending with _t suffix::\\n\\n    typedef int signed_32_bit_t;\\n\\nEnum\\n^^^^\\n\\nEnums should be defined through the `typedef` and be namespaced::\\n\\n    typedef enum\\n    {\\n        MODULE_FOO_ONE,\\n        MODULE_FOO_TWO,\\n        MODULE_FOO_THREE\\n    } module_foo_t;\\n\\n\\n.. _assertions:\\n\\nAssertions\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe standard C ``assert()`` function, defined in ``assert.h`` should be used to check conditions that should be true in source code. In the default configuration, an assert condition that returns ``false`` or 0 will call ``abort()`` and trigger a :doc:`Fatal Error </api-guides/fatal-errors>`.\\n\\n``assert()`` should only be used to detect unrecoverable errors due to a serious internal logic bug or corruption, where it is not possible for the program to continue. For recoverable errors, including errors that are possible due to invalid external input, an :doc:`error value should be returned </api-guides/error-handling>`.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   When asserting a value of type ``esp_err_t`` is equal to ``ESP_OK``, use the :ref:`esp-error-check-macro` instead of an ``assert()``.\\n\\nIt is possible to configure ESP-IDF projects with assertions disabled (see :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_ASSERTION_LEVEL`). Therefore, functions called in an ``assert()`` statement should not have side-effects.\\n\\nIt is also necessary to use particular techniques to avoid \"variable set but not used\" warnings when assertions are disabled, due to code patterns such as::\\n\\n  int res = do_something();\\n  assert(res == 0);\\n\\nOnce the ``assert`` is optimized out, the ``res`` value is unused and the compiler will warn about this. However the function ``do_something()`` must still be called, even if assertions are disabled.\\n\\nWhen the variable is declared and initialized in a single statement, a good strategy is to cast it to ``void`` on a new line. The compiler will not produce a warning, and the variable can still be optimized out of the final binary::\\n\\n  int res = do_something();\\n  assert(res == 0);\\n  (void)res;\\n\\nIf the variable is declared separately, for example if it is used for multiple assertions, then it can be declared with the GCC attribute ``__attribute__((unused))``. The compiler will not produce any unused variable warnings, but the variable can still be optimized out::\\n\\n  int res __attribute__((unused));\\n\\n  res = do_something();\\n  assert(res == 0);\\n\\n  res = do_something_else();\\n  assert(res != 0);\\n\\n\\nHeader File Guards\\n------------------\\n\\nAll public facing header files should have preprocessor guards. A pragma is preferred::\\n\\n    #pragma once\\n\\nover the following pattern::\\n\\n    #ifndef FILE_NAME_H\\n    #define FILE_NAME_H\\n    ...\\n    #endif // FILE_NAME_H\\n\\nIn addition to guard macros, all C header files should have ``extern \"C\"`` guards to allow the header to be used from C++ code. Note that the following order should be used: ``pragma once``, then any ``#include`` statements, then ``extern \"C\"`` guards::\\n\\n    #pragma once\\n\\n    #include <stdint.h>\\n\\n    #ifdef __cplusplus\\n    extern \"C\" {\\n    #endif\\n\\n    /* declarations go here */\\n\\n    #ifdef __cplusplus\\n    }\\n    #endif\\n\\n\\nInclude Statements\\n------------------\\n\\nWhen writing ``#include`` statements, try to maintain the following order:\\n\\n* C standard library headers.\\n* Other POSIX standard headers and common extensions to them (such as ``sys/queue.h``.)\\n* Common IDF headers (``esp_log.h``, ``esp_system.h``, ``esp_timer.h``, ``esp_sleep.h``, etc.)\\n* Headers of other components, such as FreeRTOS.\\n* Public headers of the current component.\\n* Private headers.\\n\\nUse angle brackets for C standard library headers and other POSIX headers (``#include <stdio.h>``).\\n\\nUse double quotes for all other headers (``#include \"esp_log.h\"``).\\n\\n\\nC++ Code Formatting\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe same rules as for C apply. Where they are not enough, apply the following rules.\\n\\nFile Naming\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nC++ Header files have the extension ``.hpp``. C++ source files have the extension ``.cpp``. The latter is important for the compiler to distinguish them from normal C source files.\\n\\nNaming\\n^^^^^^\\n\\n* **Class and struct** names shall be written in ``CamelCase`` with a capital letter as beginning. Member variables and methods shall be in ``snake_case``. An exception from ``CamelCase`` is if the readability is severely decreased, e.g., in ``GPIOOutput``, then an underscore ``_`` is allowed to make it more readable: ``GPIO_Output``.\\n* **Namespaces** shall be in lower ``snake_case``.\\n* **Templates** are specified in the line above the function declaration.\\n* Interfaces in terms of Object-Oriented Programming shall be named without the suffix ``...Interface``. Later, this makes it easier to extract interfaces from normal classes and vice versa without making a breaking change.\\n\\nMember Order in Classes\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nIn order of precedence:\\n\\n* First put the public members, then the protected, then private ones. Omit public, protected or private sections without any members.\\n* First put constructors/destructors, then member functions, then member variables.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n::\\n\\n    class ForExample {\\n    public:\\n        // first constructors, then default constructor, then destructor\\n        ForExample(double example_factor_arg);\\n        ForExample();\\n        ~ForExample();\\n\\n        // then remaining pubic methods\\n        set_example_factor(double example_factor_arg);\\n\\n        // then public member variables\\n        uint32_t public_data_member;\\n\\n    private:\\n        // first private methods\\n        void internal_method();\\n\\n        // then private member variables\\n        double example_factor;\\n    };\\n\\nSpacing\\n^^^^^^^\\n\\n* Do not indent inside namespaces.\\n* Put ``public``, ``protected`` and ``private`` labels at the same indentation level as the corresponding ``class`` label.\\n\\nSimple Example\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n::\\n\\n    // file spaceship.h\\n    #ifndef SPACESHIP_H_\\n    #define SPACESHIP_H_\\n    #include <cstdlib>\\n\\n    namespace spaceships {\\n\\n    class SpaceShip {\\n    public:\\n        SpaceShip(size_t crew);\\n        size_t get_crew_size() const;\\n\\n    private:\\n        const size_t crew;\\n    };\\n\\n    class SpaceShuttle : public SpaceShip {\\n    public:\\n        SpaceShuttle();\\n    };\\n\\n    class Sojuz : public SpaceShip {\\n    public:\\n        Sojuz();\\n    };\\n\\n    template <typename T>\\n    class CargoShip {\\n    public:\\n        CargoShip(const T &cargo);\\n\\n    private:\\n        T cargo;\\n    };\\n\\n    } // namespace spaceships\\n\\n    #endif // SPACESHIP_H_\\n\\n    // file spaceship.cpp\\n    #include \"spaceship.h\"\\n\\n    namespace spaceships {\\n\\n    // Putting the curly braces in the same line for constructors is OK if it only initializes\\n    // values in the initializer list\\n    SpaceShip::SpaceShip(size_t crew) : crew(crew) { }\\n\\n    size_t SpaceShip::get_crew_size() const\\n    {\\n        return crew;\\n    }\\n\\n    SpaceShuttle::SpaceShuttle() : SpaceShip(7)\\n    {\\n        // doing further initialization\\n    }\\n\\n    Sojuz::Sojuz() : SpaceShip(3)\\n    {\\n        // doing further initialization\\n    }\\n\\n    template <typename T>\\n    CargoShip<T>::CargoShip(const T &cargo) : cargo(cargo) { }\\n\\n    } // namespace spaceships\\n\\n\\nCMake Code Style\\n----------------\\n\\n- Indent with four spaces.\\n- Maximum line length 120 characters. When splitting lines, try to\\n  focus on readability where possible (for example, by pairing up\\n  keyword/argument pairs on individual lines).\\n- Do not put anything in the optional parentheses after ``endforeach()``, ``endif()``, etc.\\n- Use lowercase (``with_underscores``) for command, function, and macro names.\\n- For locally scoped variables, use lowercase (``with_underscores``).\\n- For globally scoped variables, use uppercase (``WITH_UNDERSCORES``).\\n- Otherwise follow the defaults of the cmake-lint_ project.\\n\\nConfiguring the Code Style for a Project Using EditorConfig\\n-----------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEditorConfig helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs. The EditorConfig project consists of a file format for defining coding styles and a collection of text editor plugins that enable editors to read the file format and adhere to defined styles. EditorConfig files are easily readable and they work nicely with version control systems.\\n\\nFor more information, see `EditorConfig <https://editorconfig.org>`_ Website.\\n\\nThird Party Component Code Styles\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nESP-IDF integrates a number of third party components where these components may have differing code styles.\\n\\nFreeRTOS\\n^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe code style adopted by FreeRTOS is described in the `FreeRTOS style guide <https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-Coding-Standard-and-Style-Guide.html#StyleGuide>`_. Formatting of FreeRTOS source code is automated using `Uncrustify <https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify>`_, thus a copy of the FreeRTOS code style\\'s Uncrustify configuration (``uncrustify.cfg``) is stored within ESP-IDF FreeRTOS component.\\n\\nIf a FreeRTOS source file is modified, the updated file can be formatted again by following the steps below:\\n\\n1.

Overview\\n===========\\n\\n1.1 What Is Wireshark?\\n======================\\n\\n`Wireshark <https://www.wireshark.org>`_ (originally named \"Ethereal\") is a network packet analyzer that captures network packets and displays the packet data as detailed as possible. It uses WinPcap as its interface to directly capture network traffic going through a network interface controller (NIC).\\n\\nYou could think of a network packet analyzer as a measuring device used to examine what is going on inside a network cable, just like a voltmeter is used by an electrician to examine what is going on inside an electric cable.\\n\\nIn the past, such tools were either very expensive, proprietary, or both. However, with the advent of Wireshark, all that has changed.\\n\\nWireshark is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, which means you can use the software and the source code free of charge. It also allows you to modify and customize the source code.\\n\\nWireshark is, perhaps, one of the best open source packet analyzers available today.\\n\\n\\n1.2 Some Intended Purposes\\n==========================\\n\\nHere are some examples of how Wireshark is typically used:\\n\\n* Network administrators use it to troubleshoot network problems.\\n\\n* Network security engineers use it to examine security problems.\\n\\n* Developers use it to debug protocol implementations.\\n\\n* People use it to learn more about network protocol internals.\\n\\nBeside these examples, Wireshark can be used for many other purposes.\\n\\n\\n1.3 Features\\n============\\n\\nThe main features of Wireshark are as follows:\\n\\n* Available for UNIX and Windows\\n\\n* Captures live packet data from a network interface\\n\\n* Displays packets along with detailed protocol information\\n\\n* Opens/saves the captured packet data\\n\\n* Imports/exports packets into a number of file formats, supported by other capture programs\\n\\n* Advanced packet filtering\\n\\n* Searches for packets based on multiple criteria\\n\\n* Colorizes packets according to display filters\\n\\n* Calculates statistics\\n\\n* ... and a lot more!\\n\\n\\n1.4 Wireshark Can or Cannot Do\\n==============================\\n\\n* **Live capture from different network media**.\\n\\n  Wireshark can capture traffic from different network media, including wireless LAN.\\n\\n* **Import files from many other capture programs**.\\n\\n  Wireshark can import data from a large number of file formats, supported by other capture programs.\\n\\n* **Export files for many other capture programs**.\\n\\n  Wireshark can export data into a large number of file formats, supported by other capture programs.\\n\\n* **Numerous protocol dissectors**.\\n\\n  Wireshark can dissect, or decode, a large number of protocols.\\n\\n* **Wireshark is not an intrusion detection system**.\\n\\n  It will not warn you if there are any suspicious activities on your network. However, if strange things happen, Wireshark might help you figure out what is really going on.\\n\\n* **Wireshark does not manipulate processes on the network, it can only perform \"measurements\" within it**.\\n\\n  Wireshark does not send packets on the network or influence it in any other way, except for resolving names (converting numerical address values into a human readable format), but even that can be disabled.\\n\\n\\n==========================\\n1. Where to Get Wireshark\\n==========================\\n\\nYou can get Wireshark from the official website: https://www.wireshark.org/download.html\\n\\nWireshark can run on various operating systems. Please download the correct version according to the operating system you are using.\\n\\n\\n======================\\n3. Step-by-step Guide\\n======================\\n\\n**This demonstration uses Wireshark 2.2.6 on Linux.**\\n\\n\\n**a) Start Wireshark**\\n\\nOn Linux, you can run the shell script provided below. It starts Wireshark, then configures NIC and the channel for packet capture.\\n\\n::\\n\\n  ifconfig $1 down\\n  iwconfig $1 mode monitor\\n  iwconfig $1 channel $2\\n  ifconfig $1 up\\n  Wireshark&\\n\\nIn the above script, the parameter ``$1`` represents NIC and ``$2`` represents channel. For example, ``wlan0`` in ``./xxx.sh wlan0 6``, specifies the NIC for packet capture, and ``6`` identifies the channel of an AP or Soft-AP.\\n\\n\\n**b) Run the Shell Script to Open Wireshark and Display Capture Interface**\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/ws-capture-interface.jpeg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Wireshark Capture Interface\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n    :width: 60%\\n\\n    Wireshark Capture Interface\\n\\n**c) Select the Interface to Start Packet Capture**\\n\\nAs the red markup shows in the picture above, many interfaces are available.

       " '***************\\nUSB OTG Console\\n***************\\n\\nOn chips with an integrated USB peripheral, it is possible to use USB Communication Device Class (CDC) to implement the serial console, instead of using UART with an external USB-UART bridge chip. {IDF_TARGET_NAME} ROM code contains a USB CDC implementation, which supports for some basic functionality without requiring the application to include the USB stack:\\n\\n* Bidirectional serial console, which can be used with :doc:`IDF Monitor <tools/idf-monitor>` or another serial monitor\\n* Flashing using ``esptool.py`` and ``idf.py flash``.\\n* :doc:`Device Firmware Update (DFU) <dfu>` interface for flashing the device using ``dfu-util`` and ``idf.py dfu``.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    At the moment, this \"USB Console\" feature is incompatible with TinyUSB stack.

Since CDC console is provided via USB_OTG peripheral, it cannot be used through the internal PHY in this configuration.\\n\\n    You can permanently switch the internal USB PHY to work with USB_OTG peripheral instead of USB_SERIAL_JTAG by burning ``USB_PHY_SEL`` eFuse. See ESP32-S3 Technical Reference Manual for more details about USB_SERIAL_JTAG and USB_OTG.\\n\\n    Note however that USB_SERIAL_JTAG also provides a CDC console, so enabling the CDC console should not be the primary reason for switching from USB_SERIAL_JTAG to USB_CDC.\\n\\n\\nSoftware Configuration\\n======================\\n\\nUSB console feature can be enabled using ``CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_USB_CDC`` option in menuconfig tool (see :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_UART`).\\n\\nOnce the option is enabled, build the project as usual.\\n\\nUploading the Application\\n=========================\\n\\n.. _usb_console_initial_upload:\\n\\nInitial Upload\\n--------------\\n\\nIf the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is not yet flashed with a program that enables a USB console, an initial upload of the program is required.

On most operating systems (Windows 8 and later, Linux, macOS) driver installation is not required. Find the port name using Device Manager (Windows) or by listing ``/dev/ttyACM*`` devices on Linux or ``/dev/cu*`` devices on macOS.\\n* Run ``idf.py flash -p PORT`` to upload the application, with ``PORT`` determined in the previous step.\\n\\nInitial Upload Using the ROM Download Mode, over USB DFU\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n* Place {IDF_TARGET_NAME} into download mode.

These may or may not be significant, depending on the type of application being developed, and the development workflow. Most of these limitations stem from the fact that USB CDC is implemented in software, so the console working over USB CDC is more fragile and complex than a console working over UART.\\n\\n1. If the application crashes, panic handler output may not be sent over USB CDC in some cases. If the memory used by the CDC driver is corrupted, or there is some other system-level issue, CDC may not work for sending panic handler messages over USB. This does work in many situations, but is not guaranteed to work as reliably as the UART output does. Similarly, if the application enters a boot loop before the USB CDC driver has a chance to start up, there will be no console output.\\n\\n2. If the application accidentally reconfigures the USB peripheral pins, or disables the USB peripheral, USB CDC device will disappear from the system. After fixing the issue in the application, you will need to follow the :ref:`usb_console_initial_upload` process to flash the application again.\\n\\n3. If the application enters light sleep (including automatic light sleep) or deep sleep mode, USB CDC device will disappear from the system.\\n\\n4. USB CDC driver reserves some amount of RAM and increases application code size. Keep this in mind if trying to optimize application memory usage.\\n\\n5. By default, the low-level ``esp_rom_printf`` feature and ``ESP_EARLY_LOG`` are disabled when USB CDC is used. These can be enabled using :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_USB_CDC_SUPPORT_ETS_PRINTF` option. With this option enabled, ``esp_rom_printf`` can be used, at the expense of increased IRAM usage. Keep in mind that the cost of ``esp_rom_printf`` and ``ESP_EARLY_LOG`` over USB CDC is significantly higher than over UART. This makes these logging mechanisms much less suitable for \"printf debugging\", especially in the interrupt handlers.\\n\\n6. If you are developing an application which uses the USB peripheral with the TinyUSB stack, this USB Console feature can not be used. This is mainly due to the following reasons:\\n\\n   * This feature relies on a different USB CDC software stack in {IDF_TARGET_NAME} ROM.\\n   * USB descriptors used by the ROM CDC stack may be different from the descriptors used by TinyUSB.\\n   * When developing applications which use USB peripheral, it is very likely that USB functionality will not work or will not fully work at some moments during development. This can be due to misconfigured USB descriptors, errors in the USB stack usage, or other reasons. In this case, using the UART console for flashing and monitoring provides a much better development experience.\\n\\n7. When debugging the application using JTAG, USB CDC may stop working if the CPU is stopped on a breakpoint. USB CDC operation relies on interrupts from the USB peripheral being serviced periodically. If the host computer does not receive valid responses from the USB device side for some time, it may decide to disconnect the device. The actual time depends on the OS and the driver, and ranges from a few hundred milliseconds to a few seconds.\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'Running ESP-IDF Applications on Host\\n====================================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Running ESP-IDF applications on host is currently still an experimental feature, thus there is no guarantee for API stability. However, user feedback via the `ESP-IDF GitHub repository <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf>`_ or the `ESP32 forum <https://esp32.com/>`_ is highly welcome, and may help influence the future of design of the ESP-IDF host-based applications.\\n\\nThis document provides an overview of the methods to run ESP-IDF applications on Linux, and what type of ESP-IDF applications can typically be run on Linux.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nTypically, an ESP-IDF application is built (cross-compiled) on a host machine, uploaded (i.e., flashed) to an ESP chip for execution, and monitored by the host machine via a UART/USB port. However, execution of an ESP-IDF application on an ESP chip can be limiting in various development/usage/testing scenarios.\\n\\nTherefore, it is possible for an ESP-IDF application to be built and executed entirely within the same Linux host machine (henceforth referred to as \"running on host\"). Running ESP-IDF applications on host has several advantages:\\n\\n- No need to upload to a target.\\n- Faster execution on a host machine, compared to running on an ESP chip.\\n- No requirements for any specific hardware, except the host machine itself.\\n- Easier automation and setup for software testing.\\n- Large number of tools for code and runtime analysis, e.g., Valgrind.\\n\\nA large number of ESP-IDF components depend on chip-specific hardware. These hardware dependencies must be mocked or simulated when running on host. ESP-IDF currently supports the following mocking and simulation approaches:\\n\\n1. Using the `FreeRTOS POSIX/Linux simulator <https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-simulator-for-Linux.html>`_ that simulates FreeRTOS scheduling. On top of this simulation, other APIs are also simulated or implemented when running on host.\\n2. Using `CMock <https://www.throwtheswitch.org/cmock>`_ to mock all dependencies and run the code in complete isolation.\\n\\nIn principle, it is possible to mix both approaches (POSIX/Linux simulator and mocking using CMock), but this has not been done yet in ESP-IDF. Note that despite the name, the FreeRTOS POSIX/Linux simulator currently also works on macOS. Running ESP-IDF applications on host machines is often used for testing. However, simulating the environment and mocking dependencies does not fully represent the target device. Thus, testing on the target device is still necessary, though with a different focus that usually puts more weight on integration and system testing.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Another possibility to run applications on the host is to use the QEMU simulator. However, QEMU development for ESP-IDF applications is still a work in progress and has not been documented yet.\\n\\nCMock-Based Approach\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThis approach uses the `CMock <https://www.throwtheswitch.org/cmock>`_ framework to solve the problem of missing hardware and software dependencies. CMock-based applications running on the host machine have the added advantage that they usually only compile the necessary code, i.e., the (mostly mocked) dependencies instead of the entire system. For a general introduction to Mocks and how to configure and use them in ESP-IDF, please refer to :ref:`mocks`.\\n\\n\\nPOSIX/Linux Simulator Approach\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe `FreeRTOS POSIX/Linux simulator <https://www.freertos.org/FreeRTOS-simulator-for-Linux.html>`_ is available on ESP-IDF as a preview target already. This simulator allows ESP-IDF components to be implemented on the host, making them accessible to ESP-IDF applications when running on host. Currently, only a limited number of components are ready to be built on Linux. Furthermore, the functionality of each component ported to Linux may also be limited or different compared to the functionality when building that component for a chip target. For more information about whether the desired components are supported on Linux, please refer to :ref:`component-linux-mock-support`.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32p4\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        The FreeRTOS POSIX/Linux simulator allows configuring the :ref:`amazon_smp_freertos` version. However, the simulation still runs in single-core mode. The main reason allowing Amazon SMP FreeRTOS is to provide API compatibility with ESP-IDF applications written for Amazon SMP FreeRTOS.\\n\\nRequirements for Using Mocks\\n----------------------------\\n\\n.. include:: inc/linux-host-requirements.rst\\n\\nIf any mocks are used, then ``Ruby`` is required, too.\\n\\nBuild and Run\\n-------------\\n\\nTo build the application on Linux, the target has to be set to ``linux`` and then it can be built and run:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  idf.py --preview set-target linux\\n  idf.py build\\n  idf.py monitor\\n\\n.. _component-linux-mock-support:\\n\\nComponent Linux/Mock Support Overview\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nNote that any \"Yes\" here does not necessarily mean a full implementation or mocking. It can also mean a partial implementation or mocking of functionality.

       " 'Deep Sleep Wake Stubs\\n=====================\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports running a \"deep sleep wake stub\" when coming out of deep sleep. This function runs immediately as soon as the chip wakes up - before any normal initialisation, bootloader, or ESP-IDF code has run. After the wake stub runs, the SoC can go back to sleep or continue to start ESP-IDF normally.\\n\\nDeep sleep wake stub code is loaded into \"RTC Fast Memory\" and any data which it uses must also be loaded into RTC memory. RTC memory regions hold their contents during deep sleep.\\n\\n\\nRules for Wake Stubs\\n--------------------\\n\\nWake stub code must be carefully written:\\n\\n* As the SoC has freshly woken from sleep, most of the peripherals are in reset states. The SPI flash is unmapped.\\n\\n* The wake stub code can only call functions implemented in ROM or loaded into RTC Fast Memory (see below.)\\n\\n* The wake stub code can only access data loaded in RTC memory. All other RAM will be unintiailised and have random contents. The wake stub can use other RAM for temporary storage, but the contents will be overwritten when the SoC goes back to sleep or starts ESP-IDF.\\n\\n* RTC memory must include any read-only data (.rodata) used by the stub.\\n\\n* Data in RTC memory is initialised whenever the SoC restarts, except when waking from deep sleep. When waking from deep sleep, the values which were present before going to sleep are kept.\\n\\n* Wake stub code is a part of the main esp-idf app. During normal running of esp-idf, functions can call the wake stub functions or access RTC memory. It is as if these were regular parts of the app.\\n\\n\\nImplementing A Stub\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe wake stub in esp-idf is called ``esp_wake_deep_sleep()``. This function runs whenever the SoC wakes from deep sleep. There is a default version of this function provided in esp-idf, but the default function is weak-linked so if your app contains a function named ``esp_wake_deep_sleep()`` then this will override the default.\\n\\nIf supplying a custom wake stub, the first thing it does should be to call ``esp_default_wake_deep_sleep()``.\\n\\nIt is not necessary to implement ``esp_wake_deep_sleep()`` in your app in order to use deep sleep. It is only necessary if you want to have special behaviour immediately on wake.\\n\\nIf you want to swap between different deep sleep stubs at runtime, it is also possible to do this by calling the ``esp_set_deep_sleep_wake_stub()`` function. This is not necessary if you only use the default ``esp_wake_deep_sleep()`` function.\\n\\nAll of these functions are declared in the ``esp_sleep.h`` header under components/{IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}.\\n\\n\\nLoading Code Into RTC Memory\\n----------------------------\\n\\nWake stub code must be resident in RTC Fast Memory. This can be done in one of two ways.\\n\\nThe first way is to use the ``RTC_IRAM_ATTR`` attribute to place a function into RTC memory::\\n\\n    void RTC_IRAM_ATTR esp_wake_deep_sleep(void) {\\n        esp_default_wake_deep_sleep();\\n        // Add additional functionality here\\n    }\\n\\nThe second way is to place the function into any source file whose name starts with ``rtc_wake_stub``. Files names ``rtc_wake_stub*`` have their contents automatically put into RTC memory by the linker.\\n\\nThe first way is simpler for very short and simple code, or for source files where you want to mix \"normal\" and \"RTC\" code. The second way is simpler when you want to write longer pieces of code for RTC memory.\\n\\n\\nLoading Data Into RTC Memory\\n----------------------------\\n\\nData used by stub code must be resident in RTC memory.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_RTC_SLOW_MEM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    The data can be placed in RTC Fast memory or in RTC Slow memory which is also used by the ULP.\\n\\nSpecifying this data can be done in one of two ways:\\n\\nThe first way is to use the ``RTC_DATA_ATTR`` and ``RTC_RODATA_ATTR`` to specify any data (writeable or read-only, respectively) which should be loaded into RTC memory::\\n\\n    RTC_DATA_ATTR int wake_count;\\n\\n    void RTC_IRAM_ATTR esp_wake_deep_sleep(void) {\\n        esp_default_wake_deep_sleep();\\n        static RTC_RODATA_ATTR const char fmt_str[] = \"Wake count %d\\\\n\";\\n        esp_rom_printf(fmt_str, wake_count++);\\n    }\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_RTC_SLOW_MEM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    The RTC memory area where this data will be placed can be configured via menuconfig option named ``CONFIG_{IDF_TARGET_CFG_PREFIX}_RTCDATA_IN_FAST_MEM``. This option allows to keep slow memory area for ULP programs and once it is enabled the data marked with ``RTC_DATA_ATTR`` and ``RTC_RODATA_ATTR`` are placed in the RTC fast memory segment otherwise it goes to RTC slow memory (default option). This option depends on the :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE` option because RTC fast memory can be accessed only by PRO_CPU.\\n\\n    The attributes ``RTC_FAST_ATTR`` and ``RTC_SLOW_ATTR`` can be used to specify data that will be force placed into RTC_FAST and RTC_SLOW memory respectively. Any access to data marked with ``RTC_FAST_ATTR`` is allowed by PRO_CPU only and it is responsibility of user to make sure about it.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_RTC_SLOW_MEM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    The attributes ``RTC_FAST_ATTR`` and ``RTC_SLOW_ATTR`` can be used to specify data that will be force placed into RTC_FAST and RTC_SLOW memory respectively, but for {IDF_TARGET_NAME} there is only RTC fast memory, so both attributes will map to this region.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, any string constants used in this way must be declared as arrays and marked with RTC_RODATA_ATTR, as shown in the example above.\\n\\nThe second way is to place the data into any source file whose name starts with ``rtc_wake_stub``.\\n\\nFor example, the equivalent example in ``rtc_wake_stub_counter.c``::\\n\\n    int wake_count;\\n\\n    void RTC_IRAM_ATTR esp_wake_deep_sleep(void) {\\n        esp_default_wake_deep_sleep();\\n        esp_rom_printf(\"Wake count %d\\\\n\", wake_count++);\\n    }\\n\\nThe second way is a better option if you need to use strings, or write other more complex code.\\n\\nTo reduce wake-up time use the `CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_SKIP_VALIDATE_IN_DEEP_SLEEP` Kconfig option, see more information in :doc:`Fast boot from Deep Sleep <bootloader>`.\\n\\n\\nCRC Check For Wake Stubs\\n------------------------\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_PM_SUPPORT_DEEPSLEEP_CHECK_STUB_ONLY\\n\\n    During deep sleep, only the wake stubs area of RTC Fast memory is validated with CRC. When {IDF_TARGET_NAME} wakes up from deep sleep, the wake stubs area is validated again. If the validation passes, the wake stubs code will be executed. Otherwise, the normal initialization, bootloader, and esp-idf codes will be executed.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_PM_SUPPORT_DEEPSLEEP_CHECK_STUB_ONLY\\n\\n    During deep sleep, all RTC Fast memory areas will be validated with CRC. When {IDF_TARGET_NAME} wakes up from deep sleep, the RTC fast memory will be validated with CRC again. If the validation passes, the wake stubs code will be executed. Otherwise, the normal initialization, bootloader and esp-idf codes will be executed.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    When the `CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_ALLOW_RTC_FAST_MEM_AS_HEAP` option is enabled, all the RTC fast memory except the wake stubs area is added to the heap.\\n\\n\\nExample\\n-------\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_RTC_FAST_MEM_SUPPORTED\\n\\nESP-IDF provides an example to show how to implement the Deep-sleep wake stub.\\n\\n- :example:`system/deep_sleep_wake_stub`\\n',\n",

ESP-IDF provides three ways to make use of such variables:\\n\\n- :ref:`freertos-native`: ESP-IDF FreeRTOS native APIs.\\n- :ref:`pthread-api`: ESP-IDF pthread APIs.\\n- :ref:`c11-std`: C11 standard introduces special keywords to declare variables as thread local.\\n\\n.. _freertos-native:\\n\\nFreeRTOS Native APIs\\n--------------------\\n\\nThe ESP-IDF FreeRTOS provides the following APIs to manage thread local variables:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`vTaskSetThreadLocalStoragePointer`\\n- :cpp:func:`pvTaskGetThreadLocalStoragePointer`\\n- :cpp:func:`vTaskSetThreadLocalStoragePointerAndDelCallback`\\n\\nIn this case, the maximum number of variables that can be allocated is limited by :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_THREAD_LOCAL_STORAGE_POINTERS`. Variables are kept in the task control block (TCB) and accessed by their index. Note that index 0 is reserved for ESP-IDF internal uses.\\n\\nUsing the APIs above, you can allocate thread local variables of an arbitrary size, and assign them to any number of tasks. Different tasks can have different sets of TLS variables.\\n\\nIf size of the variable is more than 4 bytes, then you need to allocate/deallocate memory for it. Variable's deallocation is initiated by FreeRTOS when task is deleted, but user must provide callback function to do proper cleanup.\\n\\n.. _pthread-api:\\n\\nPthread APIs\\n----------------\\n\\nThe ESP-IDF provides the following :doc:`/api-reference/system/pthread` to manage thread local variables:\\n\\n- :cpp:func:`pthread_key_create`\\n- :cpp:func:`pthread_key_delete`\\n- :cpp:func:`pthread_getspecific`\\n- :cpp:func:`pthread_setspecific`\\n\\nThese APIs have all benefits of the ones above, but eliminates some their limits. The number of variables is limited only by size of available memory on the heap. Due to the dynamic nature, this API introduces additional performance overhead compared to the native one.\\n\\n.. _c11-std:\\n\\nC11 Standard\\n------------\\n\\nThe ESP-IDF FreeRTOS supports thread local variables according to C11 standard, ones specified with ``__thread`` keyword. For details on this feature, please refer to the `GCC documentation <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-5.5.0/gcc/Thread-Local.html#Thread-Local>`_.\\n\\nStorage for that kind of variables is allocated on the task stack. Note that area for all such variables in the program is allocated on the stack of every task in the system even if that task does not use such variables at all. For example, ESP-IDF system tasks (e.g., ``ipc``, ``timer`` tasks etc.) will also have that extra stack space allocated. Thus feature should be used with care.\\n\\nUsing C11 thread local variables comes at a trade-off. On one hand, they are quite handy to use in programming and can be accessed using minimal CPU instructions. However, this benefit comes at the cost of additional stack usage for all tasks in the system. Due to static nature of variables allocation, all tasks in the system have the same sets of C11 thread local variables.\\n\",\n",
       " 'RF Calibration\\n==============\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports three RF calibration methods during RF initialization:\\n\\n1. Partial calibration\\n\\n2. Full calibration\\n\\n3. No calibration\\n\\nPartial Calibration\\n-------------------\\n\\nDuring RF initialization, the partial calibration method is used by default for RF calibration. It is done based on the full calibration data which is stored in the NVS. To use this method, please go to ``menuconfig`` and enable :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_PHY_CALIBRATION_AND_DATA_STORAGE`.\\n\\nFull Calibration\\n----------------\\n\\nFull calibration is triggered in the following conditions:\\n\\n1. NVS does not exist.\\n\\n2. The NVS partition to store calibration data has been erased.\\n\\n3. Hardware MAC address has changed.\\n\\n4. PHY library version has changed.\\n\\n5. The RF calibration data loaded from the NVS partition is broken.\\n\\nFull calibration takes 100 ms longer than the partial calibration method. If boot duration is not of critical importance to the application, the full calibration method is recommended. To switch to the full calibration method, go to ``menuconfig`` and disable :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_PHY_CALIBRATION_AND_DATA_STORAGE`. If you use the default method of RF calibration, there are two ways to add the function of triggering full calibration as a last-resort remedy.\\n\\n1. Erase the NVS partition if you do not mind all of the data stored in the NVS partition is erased. That is indeed the easiest way.\\n\\n2. Call API :cpp:func:`esp_phy_erase_cal_data_in_nvs` before initializing Wi-Fi and Bluetooth®/Bluetooth Low Energy based on some conditions (e.g., an option provided in some diagnostic mode). In this case, only the PHY namespace of the NVS partition is erased.\\n\\nNo Calibration\\n---------------\\n\\nThe no calibration method is only used when the device wakes up from Deep-sleep mode.\\n\\nPHY Initialization Data\\n-----------------------\\n\\nThe PHY initialization data is used for RF calibration. There are two ways to get the PHY initialization data.\\n\\nOne is to use the default initialization data which is located in the header file :idf_file:`components/esp_phy/{IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}/include/phy_init_data.h`. It is embedded into the application binary after compiling and then stored into read-only memory (DROM). To use the default initialization data, please go to ``menuconfig`` and disable :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_PHY_INIT_DATA_IN_PARTITION`.\\n\\nAn alternative is to store the initialization data in a PHY data partition. A PHY data partition is included in the default partition table. However, when using a custom partition table, please ensure that a PHY data partition (type: ``data``, subtype: ``phy``) is included in the custom partition table. Whether you are using a custom partition table or the default partition table, if initialization data is stored in a partition, it has to be flashed there, otherwise a runtime error occurs. If you want to use initialization data stored in a partition, go to ``menuconfig`` and enable the option :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_PHY_INIT_DATA_IN_PARTITION`.\\n\\nAPI Reference\\n-------------\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_phy_init.inc\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/esp_phy_cert_test.inc\\n',\n",

       " 'Support for External RAM\\n************************\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\n.. toctree::\\n    :maxdepth: 1\\n\\nIntroduction\\n============\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_PSRAM_VADDR_SIZE:default=\"Value not updated\", esp32=\"4 MB\", esp32s2=\"10.5 MB\", esp32s3=\"32 MB\", esp32p4=\"64 MB\"}\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} has a few hundred kilobytes of internal RAM, residing on the same die as the rest of the chip components. It can be insufficient for some purposes, so {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has the ability to use up to {IDF_TARGET_PSRAM_VADDR_SIZE} of virtual addresses for external PSRAM (Psuedostatic RAM) memory. The external memory is incorporated in the memory map and, with certain restrictions, is usable in the same way as internal data RAM.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s3\\n\\n    The {IDF_TARGET_PSRAM_VADDR_SIZE} virtual addresses are shared with flash instructions and rodata.\\n\\nHardware\\n========\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports PSRAM connected in parallel with the SPI flash chip. While {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is capable of supporting several types of RAM chips, ESP-IDF currently only supports Espressif branded PSRAM chips (e.g., ESP-PSRAM32, ESP-PSRAM64, etc).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32 or esp32s2 or esp32s3\\n\\n        Some PSRAM chips are 1.8 V devices and some are 3.3 V. The working voltage of the PSRAM chip must match the working voltage of the flash component. Consult the datasheet for your PSRAM chip and {IDF_TARGET_NAME} device to find out the working voltages. For a 1.8 V PSRAM chip, make sure to either set the MTDI pin to a high signal level on bootup, or program {IDF_TARGET_NAME} eFuses to always use the VDD_SIO level of 1.8 V. Not doing this can damage the PSRAM and/or flash chip.\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32p4\\n\\n        Some PSRAM chips are 1.8 V devices and some are 3.3 V. Consult the datasheet for your PSRAM chip and {IDF_TARGET_NAME} device to find out the working voltages.\\n\\n        By default, the PSRAM is powered up by the on-chip LDO2. You can use :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_VDD_PSRAM_LDO_ID` to switch the LDO ID accordingly. Set this value to -1 to use an external power supply, which means the on-chip LDO will not be used. By default, the PSRAM connected to LDO is set to the correct voltage based on the Espressif module used. You can still use :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_VDD_PSRAM_LDO_VOLTAGE_MV` to select the LDO output voltage if you are not using an Espressif module. When using an external power supply, this option does not exist.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Espressif produces both modules and system-in-package chips that integrate compatible PSRAM and flash and are ready to mount on a product PCB. Consult the Espressif website for more information. If you are using a custom PSRAM chip, ESP-IDF SDK might not be compatible with it.\\n\\nFor specific details about connecting the SoC or module pins to an external PSRAM chip, consult the SoC or module datasheet.\\n\\n.. _external_ram_config:\\n\\n\\nConfiguring External RAM\\n========================\\n\\nESP-IDF fully supports the use of external RAM in applications. Once the external RAM is initialized at startup, ESP-IDF can be configured to integrate the external RAM in several ways:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    * :ref:`external_ram_config_memory_map`\\n    * :ref:`external_ram_config_capability_allocator`\\n    * :ref:`external_ram_config_malloc` (default)\\n    * :ref:`external_ram_config_bss`\\n    :esp32: * :ref:`external_ram_config_noinit`\\n    :SOC_SPIRAM_XIP_SUPPORTED: * :ref:`external_ram_config_instructions`\\n    :SOC_SPIRAM_XIP_SUPPORTED: * :ref:`external_ram_config_rodata`\\n\\n.. _external_ram_config_memory_map:\\n\\n\\nIntegrate RAM into the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} Memory Map\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSelect this option by choosing ``Integrate RAM into memory map`` from :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_USE`.\\n\\nThis is the most basic option for external RAM integration. Most likely, you will need another, more advanced option.\\n\\nDuring the ESP-IDF startup, external RAM is mapped into the data virtual address space. The address space is dynamically allocated. The length will be the mininum length between the PSRAM size and the available data virtual address space size.\\n\\nApplications can manually place data in external memory by creating pointers to this region. So if an application uses external memory, it is responsible for all management of the external RAM: coordinating buffer usage, preventing corruption, etc.\\n\\nIt is recommended to access the PSRAM by ESP-IDF heap memory allocator (see next chapter).\\n\\n.. _external_ram_config_capability_allocator:\\n\\n\\nAdd External RAM to the Capability Allocator\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\nSelect this option by choosing ``Make RAM allocatable using heap_caps_malloc(..., MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM)`` from :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_USE`.\\n\\nWhen enabled, memory is mapped to data virtual address space and also added to the :doc:`capabilities-based heap memory allocator </api-reference/system/mem_alloc>` using ``MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM``.\\n\\nTo allocate memory from external RAM, a program should call ``heap_caps_malloc(size, MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM)``. After use, this memory can be freed by calling the normal ``free()`` function.\\n\\n.. _external_ram_config_malloc:\\n\\n\\nProvide External RAM via malloc()\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nSelect this option by choosing ``Make RAM allocatable using malloc() as well`` from :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_USE`. This is the default option.\\n\\nIn this case, memory is added to the capability allocator as described for the previous option. However, it is also added to the pool of RAM that can be returned by the standard ``malloc()`` function.\\n\\nThis allows any application to use the external RAM without having to rewrite the code to use ``heap_caps_malloc(..., MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM)``.\\n\\nAn additional configuration item, :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_MALLOC_ALWAYSINTERNAL`, can be used to set the size threshold when a single allocation should prefer external memory:\\n\\n- When allocating a size less than the threshold, the allocator will try internal memory first.\\n- When allocating a size equal to or larger than the threshold, the allocator will try external memory first.\\n\\nIf a suitable block of preferred internal/external memory is not available, the allocator will try the other type of memory.\\n\\nBecause some buffers can only be allocated in internal memory, a second configuration item :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_MALLOC_RESERVE_INTERNAL` defines a pool of internal memory which is reserved for *only* explicitly internal allocations (such as memory for DMA use). Regular ``malloc()`` will not allocate from this pool. The :ref:`MALLOC_CAP_DMA <dma-capable-memory>` and ``MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL`` flags can be used to allocate memory from this pool.\\n\\n.. _external_ram_config_bss:\\n\\nAllow .bss Segment to Be Placed in External Memory\\n--------------------------------------------------\\n\\nEnable this option by checking :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_ALLOW_BSS_SEG_EXTERNAL_MEMORY`.\\n\\nIf enabled, the region of the data virtual address space where the PSRAM is mapped to will be used to store zero-initialized data (BSS segment) from the lwIP, net80211, libpp, wpa_supplicant and bluedroid ESP-IDF libraries.\\n\\nAdditional data can be moved from the internal BSS segment to external RAM by applying the macro ``EXT_RAM_BSS_ATTR`` to any static declaration (which is not initialized to a non-zero value).\\n\\nIt is also possible to place the BSS section of a component or a library to external RAM using linker fragment scheme ``extram_bss``.\\n\\nThis option reduces the internal static memory used by the BSS segment.\\n\\nRemaining external RAM can also be added to the capability heap allocator using the method shown above.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    .. _external_ram_config_noinit:\\n\\n    Allow .noinit Segment to Be Placed in External Memory\\n    --------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n    Enable this option by checking :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_ALLOW_NOINIT_SEG_EXTERNAL_MEMORY`. If enabled, the region of the data virtual address space where the PSRAM is mapped to will be used to store non-initialized data. The values placed in this segment will not be initialized or modified even during startup or restart.\\n\\n    By applying the macro ``EXT_RAM_NOINIT_ATTR``, data could be moved from the internal NOINIT segment to external RAM. Remaining external RAM can still be added to the capability heap allocator using the method shown above, :ref:`external_ram_config_capability_allocator`.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPIRAM_XIP_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    .. _external_ram_config_instructions:\\n\\n    Move Instructions in Flash to PSRAM\\n    -----------------------------------\\n\\n    The :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_FETCH_INSTRUCTIONS` option allows the flash ``.text`` sections (use for instructions) to be placed in PSRAM.\\n\\n    By enabling the :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_FETCH_INSTRUCTIONS` option\\n\\n    - Instructions from the ``.text`` sections of flash are moved into PSRAM on system startup.\\n\\n    - The corresponding virtual memory range of those instructions will also be re-mapped to PSRAM.\\n\\n    If :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_RODATA` is also enabled, the cache will not be disabled during an SPI1 flash operation. You do not need to make sure ISRs, ISR callbacks and involved data are placed in internal RAM, thus internal RAM usage can be optimized.\\n\\n    .. _external_ram_config_rodata:\\n\\n    Move Read-Only Data in Flash to PSRAM\\n    ---------------------------------------\\n\\n    The :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_RODATA` option allows the flash ``.rodata`` sections (use for read only data) to be placed in PSRAM.\\n\\n    By enabling the :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_RODATA` option\\n\\n    - Instructions from the ``.rodata`` sections of flash are moved into PSRAM on system startup.\\n\\n    - The corresponding virtual memory range of those rodata will also be re-mapped to PSRAM.\\n\\n    If :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_FETCH_INSTRUCTIONS` is also enabled, the cache will not be disabled during an SPI1 flash operation. You do not need to make sure ISRs, ISR callbacks and involved data are placed in internal RAM, thus internal RAM usage can be optimized.\\n\\nRestrictions\\n============\\n\\nExternal RAM use has the following restrictions:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - When flash cache is disabled (for example, if the flash is being written to), the external RAM also becomes inaccessible. Any read operations from or write operations to it will lead to an illegal cache access exception. This is also the reason why ESP-IDF does not by default allocate any task stacks in external RAM (see below).\\n\\n    :esp32s2: - External RAM cannot be used as a place to store DMA transaction descriptors or as a buffer for a DMA transfer to read from or write into. Therefore when External RAM is enabled, any buffer that will be used in combination with DMA must be allocated using ``heap_caps_malloc(size, MALLOC_CAP_DMA | MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL)`` and can be freed using a standard ``free()`` call. Note that although {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has hardware support for DMA to or from external RAM, this is not yet supported in ESP-IDF.\\n\\n    :esp32s3: - Although {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has hardware support for DMA to or from external RAM, there are still limitations:\\n\\n        :esp32s3: - DMA transaction descriptors cannot be placed in PSRAM.\\n        :esp32s3: - The bandwidth that DMA accesses external RAM is very limited, especially when the core is trying to access the external RAM at the same time.\\n        :esp32s3: - You can configure :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_SPEED` as 120 MHz for an octal PSRAM. The bandwidth will be improved. However there are still restrictions for this option. See :ref:`All Supported PSRAM Modes and Speeds <flash-psram-combination>` for more details.\\n\\n    - External RAM uses the same cache region as the external flash. This means that frequently accessed variables in external RAM can be read and modified almost as quickly as in internal RAM. However, when accessing large chunks of data (> 32 KB), the cache can be insufficient, and speeds will fall back to the access speed of the external RAM. Moreover, accessing large chunks of data can \"push out\" cached flash, possibly making the execution of code slower afterwards.\\n\\n    - In general, external RAM will not be used as task stack memory. :cpp:func:`xTaskCreate` and similar functions will always allocate internal memory for stack and task TCBs.\\n\\nThe option :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_ALLOW_STACK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY` can be used to allow placing task stacks into external memory. In these cases :cpp:func:`xTaskCreateStatic` must be used to specify a task stack buffer allocated from external memory, otherwise task stacks will still be allocated from internal memory.\\n\\n\\nFailure to Initialize\\n=====================\\n\\nBy default, failure to initialize external RAM will cause the ESP-IDF startup to abort. This can be disabled by enabling the config item :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_IGNORE_NOTFOUND`.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32s2\\n\\n    If :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_ALLOW_BSS_SEG_EXTERNAL_MEMORY` is enabled, the option to ignore failure is not available as the linker will have assigned symbols to external memory addresses at link time.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n    Encryption\\n    ==========\\n\\n    It is possible to enable automatic encryption for data stored in external RAM. When this is enabled any data read and written through the cache will automatically be encrypted or decrypted by the external memory encryption hardware.\\n\\n    This feature is enabled whenever flash encryption is enabled. For more information on how to enable and how it works see :doc:`Flash Encryption </security/flash-encryption>`.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    .. include:: inc/external-ram-esp32-notes.rst\\n\\n.. _ESP32 Series SoC Errata: https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/eco_and_workarounds_for_bugs_in_esp32_en.pdf\\n.. _ESP32 Chip Revision v3.0 User Guide: https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/ESP32_ECO_V3_User_Guide__EN.pdf\\n',\n",
       " 'Hardware Abstraction\\n====================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nESP-IDF provides a group of APIs for hardware abstraction. These APIs allow you to control peripherals at different levels of abstraction, giving you more flexibility compared to using only the ESP-IDF drivers to interact with hardware. ESP-IDF Hardware abstraction is likely to be useful for writing high-performance bare-metal drivers, or for attempting to port an ESP chip to another platform.\\n\\nThis guide is split into the following sections:\\n\\n    1. :ref:`hw-abstraction-architecture`\\n    2. :ref:`hw-abstraction-ll-layer`\\n    3. :ref:`hw-abstraction-hal-layer`\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    Hardware abstraction API (excluding the driver and ``xxx_types.h``) should be considered an experimental feature, thus cannot be considered public API. The hardware abstraction API does not adhere to the API name changing restrictions of ESP-IDF\\'s versioning scheme. In other words, it is possible that Hardware Abstraction API may change in between non-major release versions.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Although this document mainly focuses on hardware abstraction of peripherals, e.g., UART, SPI, I2C, certain layers of hardware abstraction extend to other aspects of hardware as well, e.g., some of the CPU\\'s features are partially abstracted.\\n\\n.. _hw-abstraction-architecture:\\n\\nArchitecture\\n------------\\n\\nHardware abstraction in ESP-IDF is comprised of the following layers, ordered from low level of abstraction that is closer to hardware, to high level of abstraction that is further away from hardware.\\n\\n- Low Level (LL) Layer\\n- Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)\\n- Driver Layers\\n\\nThe LL Layer, and HAL are entirely contained within the ``hal`` component. Each layer is dependent on the layer below it, i.e, driver depends on HAL, HAL depends on LL, LL depends on the register header files.\\n\\nFor a particular peripheral ``xxx``, its hardware abstraction generally consists of the header files described in the table below. Files that are **Target Specific** have a separate implementation for each target, i.e., a separate copy for each chip. However, the ``#include`` directive is still target-independent, i.e., is the same for different targets, as the build system automatically includes the correct version of the header and source files.\\n\\n.. |br| raw:: html\\n\\n    <br>\\n\\n.. list-table:: Hardware Abstraction Header Files\\n    :widths: 25 5 70\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Include |br| Directive\\n      - Target |br| Specific\\n      - Description\\n    * - ``#include \\'soc/xxx_caps.h\"``\\n      - Y\\n      - This header contains a list of C macros specifying the various capabilities of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s peripheral ``xxx``. Hardware capabilities of a peripheral include things such as the number of channels, DMA support, hardware FIFO/buffer lengths, etc.\\n    * - ``#include \"soc/xxx_struct.h\"`` |br| ``#include \"soc/xxx_reg.h\"``\\n      - Y\\n      - The two headers contain a representation of a peripheral\\'s registers in C structure and C macro format respectively, allowing you to operate a peripheral at the register level via either of these two header files.\\n    * - ``#include \"soc/xxx_pins.h\"``\\n      - Y\\n      - If certain signals of a peripheral are mapped to a particular pin of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, their mappings are defined in this header as C macros.\\n    * - ``#include \"soc/xxx_periph.h\"``\\n      - N\\n      - This header is mainly used as a convenience header file to automatically include ``xxx_caps.h``, ``xxx_struct.h``, and ``xxx_reg.h``.\\n    * - ``#include \"hal/xxx_types.h``\\n      - N\\n      - This header contains type definitions and macros that are shared among the LL, HAL, and driver layers. Moreover, it is considered public API thus can be included by the application level. The shared types and definitions usually related to non-implementation specific concepts such as the following:\\n\\n          - Protocol-related types/macros such a frames, modes, common bus speeds, etc.\\n          - Features/characteristics of an ``xxx`` peripheral that are likely to be present on any implementation (implementation-independent) such as channels, operating modes, signal amplification or attenuation intensities, etc.\\n    * - ``#include \"hal/xxx_ll.h\"``\\n      - Y\\n      - This header contains the Low Level (LL) Layer of hardware abstraction. LL Layer API are primarily used to abstract away register operations into readable functions.\\n    * - ``#include \"hal/xxx_hal.h\"``\\n      - Y\\n      - The Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) is used to abstract away peripheral operation steps into functions (e.g., reading a buffer, starting a transmission, handling an event, etc). The HAL is built on top of the LL Layer.\\n    * - ``#include \"driver/xxx.h\"``\\n      - N\\n      - The driver layer is the highest level of ESP-IDF\\'s hardware abstraction. Driver layer API are meant to be called from ESP-IDF applications, and internally utilize OS primitives. Thus, driver layer API are event-driven, and can used in a multi-threaded environment.\\n\\n\\n.. _hw-abstraction-ll-layer:\\n\\nLL (Low Level) Layer\\n--------------------\\n\\nThe primary purpose of the LL Layer is to abstract away register field access into more easily understandable functions. LL functions essentially translate various in/out arguments into the register fields of a peripheral in the form of get/set functions. All the necessary bit shifting, masking, offsetting, and endianness of the register fields should be handled by the LL functions.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    //Inside xxx_ll.h\\n\\n    static inline void xxx_ll_set_baud_rate(xxx_dev_t *hw,\\n                                            xxx_ll_clk_src_t clock_source,\\n                                            uint32_t baud_rate) {\\n        uint32_t src_clk_freq = (source_clk == XXX_SCLK_APB) ? APB_CLK_FREQ : REF_CLK_FREQ;\\n        uint32_t clock_divider = src_clk_freq / baud;\\n        // Set clock select field\\n        hw->clk_div_reg.divider = clock_divider >> 4;\\n        // Set clock divider field\\n        hw->config.clk_sel = (source_clk == XXX_SCLK_APB) ? 0 : 1;\\n    }\\n\\n    static inline uint32_t xxx_ll_get_rx_byte_count(xxx_dev_t *hw) {\\n        return hw->status_reg.rx_cnt;\\n    }\\n\\nThe code snippet above illustrates typical LL functions for a peripheral ``xxx``. LL functions typically have the following characteristics:\\n\\n- All LL functions are defined as ``static inline`` so that there is minimal overhead when calling these functions due to compiler optimization. These functions are not guaranteed to be inlined by the compiler, so any LL function that is called when the cache is disabled (e.g., from an IRAM ISR context) should be marked with ``__attribute__((always_inline))``.\\n- The first argument should be a pointer to a ``xxx_dev_t`` type. The ``xxx_dev_t`` type is a structure representing the peripheral\\'s registers, thus the first argument is always a pointer to the starting address of the peripheral\\'s registers. Note that in some cases where the peripheral has multiple channels with identical register layouts, ``xxx_dev_t *hw`` may point to the registers of a particular channel instead.\\n- LL functions should be short, and in most cases are deterministic. In other words, in the worst case, runtime of the LL function can be determined at compile time. Thus, any loops in LL functions should be finite bounded; however, there are currently a few exceptions to this rule.\\n- LL functions are not thread-safe, it is the responsibility of the upper layers (driver layer) to ensure that registers or register fields are not accessed concurrently.\\n\\n\\n.. _hw-abstraction-hal-layer:\\n\\nHAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer)\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThe HAL layer models the operational process of a peripheral as a set of general steps, where each step has an associated function. For each step, the details of a peripheral\\'s register implementation (i.e., which registers need to be set/read) are hidden (abstracted away) by the HAL. By modeling peripheral operation as a set of functional steps, any minor hardware implementation differences of the peripheral between different targets or chip versions can be abstracted away by the HAL (i.e., handled transparently). In other words, the HAL API for a particular peripheral remains mostly the same across multiple targets/chip versions.\\n\\nThe following HAL function examples are selected from the Watchdog Timer HAL as each function maps to one of the steps in a WDT\\'s operation life cycle, thus illustrating how a HAL abstracts a peripheral\\'s operation into functional steps.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    // Initialize one of the WDTs\\n    void wdt_hal_init(wdt_hal_context_t *hal, wdt_inst_t wdt_inst, uint32_t prescaler, bool enable_intr);\\n\\n    // Configure a particular timeout stage of the WDT\\n    void wdt_hal_config_stage(wdt_hal_context_t *hal, wdt_stage_t stage, uint32_t timeout, wdt_stage_action_t behavior);\\n\\n    // Start the WDT\\n    void wdt_hal_enable(wdt_hal_context_t *hal);\\n\\n    // Feed (i.e., reset) the WDT\\n    void wdt_hal_feed(wdt_hal_context_t *hal);\\n\\n    // Handle a WDT timeout\\n    void wdt_hal_handle_intr(wdt_hal_context_t *hal);\\n\\n    // Stop the WDT\\n    void wdt_hal_disable(wdt_hal_context_t *hal);\\n\\n    // De-initialize the WDT\\n    void wdt_hal_deinit(wdt_hal_context_t *hal);\\n\\n.. _hw-abstraction-hal-layer-disable-rtc-wdt:\\n\\nTo Disable RTC_WDT\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    wdt_hal_context_t rtc_wdt_ctx = RWDT_HAL_CONTEXT_DEFAULT();\\n    wdt_hal_write_protect_disable(&rtc_wdt_ctx);\\n    wdt_hal_disable(&rtc_wdt_ctx);\\n    wdt_hal_write_protect_enable(&rtc_wdt_ctx);\\n\\n.. _hw-abstraction-hal-layer-feed-rtc-wdt:\\n\\nTo Reset the RTC_WDT Counter\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    wdt_hal_context_t rtc_wdt_ctx = RWDT_HAL_CONTEXT_DEFAULT();\\n    wdt_hal_write_protect_disable(&rtc_wdt_ctx);\\n    wdt_hal_feed(&rtc_wdt_ctx);\\n    wdt_hal_write_protect_enable(&rtc_wdt_ctx);\\n\\nHAL functions generally have the following characteristics:\\n\\n- The first argument to a HAL function has the ``xxx_hal_context_t *`` type. The HAL context type is used to store information about a particular instance of the peripheral (i.e., the context instance). A HAL context is initialized by the ``xxx_hal_init()`` function and can store information such as the following:\\n\\n    - The channel number of this instance\\n    - Pointer to the peripheral\\'s (or channel\\'s) registers  (i.e., a ``xxx_dev_t *`` type)\\n    - Information about an ongoing transaction (e.g., pointer to DMA descriptor list in use)\\n    - Some configuration values for the instance (e.g., channel configurations)\\n    - Variables to maintain state information regarding the instance (e.g., a flag to indicate if the instance is waiting for transaction to complete)\\n\\n- HAL functions should not contain any OS primitives such as queues, semaphores, mutexes, etc. All synchronization/concurrency should be handled at higher layers (e.g., the driver).\\n- Some peripherals may have steps that cannot be further abstracted by the HAL, thus end up being a direct wrapper (or macro) for an LL function.\\n- Some HAL functions may be placed in IRAM thus may carry an ``IRAM_ATTR`` or be placed in a separate ``xxx_hal_iram.c`` source file.\\n',\n",
       " 'Build System\\n************\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThis document explains the implementation of the ESP-IDF build system and the concept of \"components\". Read this document if you want to know how to organize and build a new ESP-IDF project or component.\\n\\n\\nOverview\\n========\\n\\nAn ESP-IDF project can be seen as an amalgamation of a number of components. For example, for a web server that shows the current humidity, there could be:\\n\\n- The ESP-IDF base libraries (libc, ROM bindings, etc)\\n- The Wi-Fi drivers\\n- A TCP/IP stack\\n- The FreeRTOS operating system\\n- A web server\\n- A driver for the humidity sensor\\n- Main code tying it all together\\n\\nESP-IDF makes these components explicit and configurable. To do that, when a project is compiled, the build system will look up all the components in the ESP-IDF directories, the project directories and (optionally) in additional custom component directories. It then allows the user to configure the ESP-IDF project using a text-based menu system to customize each component. After the components in the project are configured, the build system will compile the project.\\n\\n\\nConcepts\\n--------\\n\\n- A \"project\" is a directory that contains all the files and configuration to build a single \"app\" (executable), as well as additional supporting elements such as a partition table, data/filesystem partitions, and a bootloader.\\n\\n- \"Project configuration\" is held in a single file called ``sdkconfig`` in the root directory of the project. This configuration file is modified via ``idf.py menuconfig`` to customize the configuration of the project. A single project contains exactly one project configuration.\\n\\n- An \"app\" is an executable that is built by ESP-IDF. A single project will usually build two apps - a \"project app\" (the main executable, ie your custom firmware) and a \"bootloader app\" (the initial bootloader program which launches the project app).\\n\\n- \"components\" are modular pieces of standalone code that are compiled into static libraries (.a files) and linked to an app. Some are provided by ESP-IDF itself, others may be sourced from other places.\\n\\n- \"Target\" is the hardware for which an application is built. A full list of supported targets in your version of ESP-IDF can be seen by running `idf.py --list-targets`.\\n\\nSome things are not part of the project:\\n\\n- \"ESP-IDF\" is not part of the project. Instead, it is standalone, and linked to the project via the ``IDF_PATH`` environment variable which holds the path of the ``esp-idf`` directory. This allows the ESP-IDF framework to be decoupled from your project.\\n\\n- The toolchain for compilation is not part of the project. The toolchain should be installed in the system command line PATH.\\n\\n\\nUsing the Build System\\n======================\\n\\n.. _idf.py:\\n\\n``idf.py``\\n----------\\n\\nThe ``idf.py`` command-line tool provides a front-end for easily managing your project builds. It manages the following tools:\\n\\n- CMake_, which configures the project to be built\\n- Ninja_ which builds the project\\n- `esptool.py`_ for flashing the target.\\n\\nYou can read more about configuring the build system using ``idf.py`` :doc:`here <tools/idf-py>`.\\n\\n\\nUsing CMake Directly\\n--------------------\\n\\n:ref:`idf.py` is a wrapper around CMake_ for convenience. However, you can also invoke CMake directly if you prefer.\\n\\n.. highlight:: bash\\n\\nWhen ``idf.py`` does something, it prints each command that it runs for easy reference. For example, the ``idf.py build`` command is the same as running these commands in a bash shell (or similar commands for Windows Command Prompt)::\\n\\n  mkdir -p build\\n  cd build\\n  cmake .. -G Ninja   # or \\'Unix Makefiles\\'\\n  ninja\\n\\nIn the above list, the ``cmake`` command configures the project and generates build files for use with the final build tool. In this case, the final build tool is Ninja_: running ``ninja`` actually builds the project.\\n\\nIt\\'s not necessary to run ``cmake`` more than once. After the first build, you only need to run ``ninja`` each time. ``ninja`` will automatically re-invoke ``cmake`` if the project needs reconfiguration.\\n\\nIf using CMake with ``ninja`` or ``make``, there are also targets for more of the ``idf.py`` sub-commands. For example, running ``make menuconfig`` or ``ninja menuconfig`` in the build directory will work the same as ``idf.py menuconfig``.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   If you\\'re already familiar with CMake_, you may find the ESP-IDF CMake-based build system unusual because it wraps a lot of CMake\\'s functionality to reduce boilerplate. See `writing pure CMake components`_ for some information about writing more \"CMake style\" components.\\n\\n\\n.. _flash-with-ninja-or-make:\\n\\nFlashing with Ninja or Make\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIt\\'s possible to build and flash directly from ninja or make by running a target like::\\n\\n  ninja flash\\n\\nOr::\\n\\n  make app-flash\\n\\nAvailable targets are: ``flash``, ``app-flash`` (app only), ``bootloader-flash`` (bootloader only).\\n\\nWhen flashing this way, optionally set the ``ESPPORT`` and ``ESPBAUD`` environment variables to specify the serial port and baud rate. You can set environment variables in your operating system or IDE project. Alternatively, set them directly on the command line::\\n\\n  ESPPORT=/dev/ttyUSB0 ninja flash\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  Providing environment variables at the start of the command like this is Bash shell Syntax. It will work on Linux and macOS. It won\\'t work when using Windows Command Prompt, but it will work when using Bash-like shells on Windows.\\n\\nOr::\\n\\n  make -j3 app-flash ESPPORT=COM4 ESPBAUD=2000000\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  Providing variables at the end of the command line is ``make`` syntax, and works for ``make`` on all platforms.\\n\\n\\nUsing CMake in an IDE\\n---------------------\\n\\nYou can also use an IDE with CMake integration. The IDE will want to know the path to the project\\'s ``CMakeLists.txt`` file. IDEs with CMake integration often provide their own build tools (CMake calls these \"generators\") to build the source files as part of the IDE.\\n\\nWhen adding custom non-build steps like \"flash\" to the IDE, it is recommended to execute ``idf.py`` for these \"special\" commands.\\n\\nFor more detailed information about integrating ESP-IDF with CMake into an IDE, see `Build System Metadata`_.\\n\\n\\n.. _setting-python-interpreter:\\n\\nSetting up the Python Interpreter\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nESP-IDF works well with Python version 3.8+.\\n\\n``idf.py`` and other Python scripts will run with the default Python interpreter, i.e., ``python``. You can switch to a different one like ``python3 $IDF_PATH/tools/idf.py ...``, or you can set up a shell alias or another script to simplify the command.\\n\\nIf using CMake directly, running ``cmake -D PYTHON=python3 ...`` will cause CMake to override the default Python interpreter.\\n\\nIf using an IDE with CMake, setting the ``PYTHON`` value as a CMake cache override in the IDE UI will override the default Python interpreter.\\n\\nTo manage the Python version more generally via the command line, check out the tools pyenv_ or virtualenv_. These let you change the default Python version.\\n\\n\\n.. _example-project-structure:\\n\\nExample Project\\n===============\\n\\n.. highlight:: none\\n\\nAn example project directory tree might look like this::\\n\\n    - myProject/\\n                 - CMakeLists.txt\\n                 - sdkconfig\\n                 - bootloader_components/ - boot_component/ - CMakeLists.txt\\n                                                            - Kconfig\\n                                                            - src1.c\\n                 - components/ - component1/ - CMakeLists.txt\\n                                             - Kconfig\\n                                             - src1.c\\n                               - component2/ - CMakeLists.txt\\n                                             - Kconfig\\n                                             - src1.c\\n                                             - include/ - component2.h\\n                 - main/       - CMakeLists.txt\\n                               - src1.c\\n                               - src2.c\\n\\n                 - build/\\n\\nThis example \"myProject\" contains the following elements:\\n\\n- A top-level project CMakeLists.txt file. This is the primary file which CMake uses to learn how to build the project; and may set project-wide CMake variables. It includes the file :idf_file:`/tools/cmake/project.cmake` which implements the rest of the build system. Finally, it sets the project name and defines the project.\\n\\n- \"sdkconfig\" project configuration file. This file is created/updated when ``idf.py menuconfig`` runs, and holds the configuration for all of the components in the project (including ESP-IDF itself). The ``sdkconfig`` file may or may not be added to the source control system of the project.\\n\\n- Optional \"bootloader_components\" directory contains components that need to be compiled and linked inside the bootloader project. A project does not have to contain custom bootloader components of this kind, but it can be useful in case the bootloader needs to be modified to embed new features.\\n\\n- Optional \"components\" directory contains components that are part of the project. A project does not have to contain custom components of this kind, but it can be useful for structuring reusable code or including third-party components that aren\\'t part of ESP-IDF. Alternatively, ``EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS`` can be set in the top-level CMakeLists.txt to look for components in other places.\\n\\n- \"main\" directory is a special component that contains source code for the project itself. \"main\" is a default name, the CMake variable ``COMPONENT_DIRS`` includes this component but you can modify this variable. See the :ref:`renaming main <rename-main>` section for more info. If you have a lot of source files in your project, we recommend grouping most into components instead of putting them all in \"main\".\\n\\n- \"build\" directory is where the build output is created. This directory is created by ``idf.py`` if it doesn\\'t already exist. CMake configures the project and generates interim build files in this directory. Then, after the main build process is run, this directory will also contain interim object files and libraries as well as final binary output files. This directory is usually not added to source control or distributed with the project source code.\\n\\nComponent directories each contain a component ``CMakeLists.txt`` file. This file contains variable definitions to control the build process of the component, and its integration into the overall project. See `Component CMakeLists Files`_ for more details.\\n\\nEach component may also include a ``Kconfig`` file defining the `component configuration`_ options that can be set via ``menuconfig``. Some components may also include ``Kconfig.projbuild`` and ``project_include.cmake`` files, which are special files for `overriding parts of the project`_.\\n\\n\\nProject CMakeLists File\\n=======================\\n\\nEach project has a single top-level ``CMakeLists.txt`` file that contains build settings for the entire project. By default, the project CMakeLists can be quite minimal.\\n\\n\\nMinimal Example CMakeLists\\n--------------------------\\n\\n.. highlight:: cmake\\n\\nMinimal project::\\n\\n      cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)\\n      include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/project.cmake)\\n      project(myProject)\\n\\n\\n.. _project-mandatory-parts:\\n\\nMandatory Parts\\n---------------\\n\\nThe inclusion of these three lines, in the order shown above, is necessary for every project:\\n\\n- ``cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)`` tells CMake the minimum version that is required to build the project. ESP-IDF is designed to work with CMake 3.16 or newer. This line must be the first line in the CMakeLists.txt file.\\n- ``include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/project.cmake)`` pulls in the rest of the CMake functionality to configure the project, discover all the components, etc.\\n- ``project(myProject)`` creates the project itself, and specifies the project name. The project name is used for the final binary output files of the app - ie ``myProject.elf``, ``myProject.bin``. Only one project can be defined per CMakeLists file.\\n\\n\\n.. _optional_project_variable:\\n\\nOptional Project Variables\\n--------------------------\\n\\nThese variables all have default values that can be overridden for custom behavior. Look in :idf_file:`/tools/cmake/project.cmake` for all of the implementation details.\\n\\n- ``COMPONENT_DIRS``: Directories to search for components. Defaults to ``IDF_PATH/components``, ``PROJECT_DIR/components``, and ``EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS``. Override this variable if you don\\'t want to search for components in these places.\\n\\n- ``EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS``: Optional list of additional directories to search for components. Paths can be relative to the project directory, or absolute.\\n\\n- ``COMPONENTS``: A list of component names to build into the project. Defaults to all components found in the ``COMPONENT_DIRS`` directories. Use this variable to \"trim down\" the project for faster build times. Note that any component which \"requires\" another component via the REQUIRES or PRIV_REQUIRES arguments on component registration will automatically have it added to this list, so the ``COMPONENTS`` list can be very short.\\n\\n- ``BOOTLOADER_IGNORE_EXTRA_COMPONENT``: A list of components, placed in ``bootloader_components/``, that should be ignored by the bootloader compilation. Use this variable if a bootloader component needs to be included conditionally inside the project.\\n\\nAny paths in these variables can be absolute paths, or set relative to the project directory.\\n\\nTo set these variables, use the `cmake set command <cmake set_>`_ ie ``set(VARIABLE \"VALUE\")``. The ``set()`` commands should be placed after the ``cmake_minimum(...)`` line but before the ``include(...)`` line.\\n\\n\\n.. _rename-main:\\n\\nRenaming ``main`` Component\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThe build system provides special treatment to the ``main`` component. It is a component that gets automatically added to the build provided that it is in the expected location, PROJECT_DIR/main. All other components in the build are also added as its dependencies, saving the user from hunting down dependencies and providing a build that works right out of the box. Renaming the ``main`` component causes the loss of these behind-the-scenes heavy lifting, requiring the user to specify the location of the newly renamed component and manually specify its dependencies. Specifically, the steps to renaming ``main`` are as follows:\\n\\n1. Rename ``main`` directory.\\n2. Set ``EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS`` in the project CMakeLists.txt to include the renamed ``main`` directory.\\n3. Specify the dependencies in the renamed component\\'s CMakeLists.txt file via REQUIRES or PRIV_REQUIRES arguments :ref:`on component registration <cmake_minimal_component_cmakelists>`.\\n\\n\\nOverriding Default Build Specifications\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nThe build sets some global build specifications (compile flags, definitions, etc.) that gets used in compiling all sources from all components.\\n\\n.. highlight:: cmake\\n\\nFor example, one of the default build specifications set is the compile option ``-Wextra``. Suppose a user wants to use override this with ``-Wno-extra``,\\nit should be done after ``project()``::\\n\\n\\n    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)\\n    include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/project.cmake)\\n    project(myProject)\\n\\n    idf_build_set_property(COMPILE_OPTIONS \"-Wno-error\" APPEND)\\n\\nThis ensures that the compile options set by the user won\\'t be overridden by the default build specifications, since the latter are set inside ``project()``.\\n\\n\\n.. _component-directories:\\n\\nComponent CMakeLists Files\\n==========================\\n\\nEach project contains one or more components. Components can be part of ESP-IDF, part of the project\\'s own components directory, or added from custom component directories (:ref:`see above <component-directories>`).\\n\\nA component is any directory in the ``COMPONENT_DIRS`` list which contains a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file.\\n\\n\\nSearching for Components\\n------------------------\\n\\nThe list of directories in ``COMPONENT_DIRS`` is searched for the project\\'s components. Directories in this list can either be components themselves (ie they contain a `CMakeLists.txt` file), or they can be top-level directories whose sub-directories are components.\\n\\nWhen CMake runs to configure the project, it logs the components included in the build. This list can be useful for debugging the inclusion/exclusion of certain components.\\n\\n\\n.. _cmake-components-same-name:\\n\\nMultiple Components with the Same Name\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nWhen ESP-IDF is collecting all the components to compile, it will do this in the order specified by ``COMPONENT_DIRS``; by default, this means ESP-IDF\\'s internal components first (``IDF_PATH/components``), then any components in directories specified in ``EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS``, and finally the project\\'s components (``PROJECT_DIR/components``). If two or more of these directories contain component sub-directories with the same name, the component in the last place searched is used. This allows, for example, overriding ESP-IDF components with a modified version by copying that component from the ESP-IDF components directory to the project components directory and then modifying it there. If used in this way, the ESP-IDF directory itself can remain untouched.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  If a component is overridden in an existing project by moving it to a new location, the project will not automatically see the new component path. Run ``idf.py reconfigure`` (or delete the project build folder) and then build again.\\n\\n\\n.. _cmake_minimal_component_cmakelists:\\n\\nMinimal Component CMakeLists\\n----------------------------\\n\\n.. highlight:: cmake\\n\\nThe minimal component ``CMakeLists.txt`` file simply registers the component to the build system using ``idf_component_register``::\\n\\n  idf_component_register(SRCS \"foo.c\" \"bar.c\"\\n                         INCLUDE_DIRS \"include\"\\n                         REQUIRES mbedtls)\\n\\n- ``SRCS`` is a list of source files (``*.c``, ``*.cpp``, ``*.cc``, ``*.S``). These source files will be compiled into the component library.\\n- ``INCLUDE_DIRS`` is a list of directories to add to the global include search path for any component which requires this component, and also the main source files.\\n- ``REQUIRES`` is not actually required, but it is very often required to declare what other components this component will use. See :ref:`component requirements <component-requirements>`.\\n\\nA library with the name of the component will be built and linked to the final app.\\n\\nDirectories are usually specified relative to the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file itself, although they can be absolute.\\n\\nThere are other arguments that can be passed to ``idf_component_register``. These arguments are discussed :ref:`here <cmake-component-register>`.\\n\\nSee `example component requirements`_ and  `example component CMakeLists`_ for more complete component ``CMakeLists.txt`` examples.\\n\\n\\n.. _preset_component_variables:\\n\\nPreset Component Variables\\n--------------------------\\n\\nThe following component-specific variables are available for use inside component CMakeLists, but should not be modified:\\n\\n- ``COMPONENT_DIR``: The component directory. Evaluates to the absolute path of the directory containing ``CMakeLists.txt``. The component path cannot contain spaces. This is the same as the ``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`` variable.\\n- ``COMPONENT_NAME``: Name of the component. Same as the name of the component directory.\\n- ``COMPONENT_ALIAS``: Alias of the library created internally by the build system for the component.\\n- ``COMPONENT_LIB``: Name of the library created internally by the build system for the component.\\n\\nThe following variables are set at the project level, but available for use in component CMakeLists:\\n\\n- ``CONFIG_*``: Each value in the project configuration has a corresponding variable available in cmake. All names begin with ``CONFIG_``. :doc:`More information here </api-reference/kconfig>`.\\n- ``ESP_PLATFORM``: Set to 1 when the CMake file is processed within the ESP-IDF build system.\\n\\n\\nBuild/Project Variables\\n-----------------------\\n\\nThe following are some project/build variables that are available as build properties and whose values can be queried using ``idf_build_get_property`` from the component CMakeLists.txt:\\n\\n- ``PROJECT_NAME``: Name of the project, as set in project CMakeLists.txt file.\\n- ``PROJECT_DIR``: Absolute path of the project directory containing the project CMakeLists. Same as the ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`` variable.\\n- ``COMPONENTS``: Names of all components that are included in this build, formatted as a semicolon-delimited CMake list.\\n- ``IDF_VER``: Git version of ESP-IDF (produced by ``git describe``)\\n- ``IDF_VERSION_MAJOR``, ``IDF_VERSION_MINOR``, ``IDF_VERSION_PATCH``: Components of ESP-IDF version, to be used in conditional expressions. Note that this information is less precise than that provided by ``IDF_VER`` variable. ``v4.0-dev-*``, ``v4.0-beta1``, ``v4.0-rc1`` and ``v4.0`` will all have the same values of ``IDF_VERSION_*`` variables, but different ``IDF_VER`` values.\\n- ``IDF_TARGET``: Name of the target for which the project is being built.\\n- ``PROJECT_VER``: Project version.\\n\\n  * If :ref:`CONFIG_APP_PROJECT_VER_FROM_CONFIG` option is set, the value of :ref:`CONFIG_APP_PROJECT_VER` will be used.\\n  * Else, if ``PROJECT_VER`` variable is set in project CMakeLists.txt file, its value will be used.\\n  * Else, if the ``PROJECT_DIR/version.txt`` exists, its contents will be used as ``PROJECT_VER``.\\n  * Else, if ``VERSION`` argument is passed to the ``project()`` call in the CMakeLists.txt file as ``project(... VERSION x.y.z.w )`` then it will be used as ``PROJECT_VER``. The ``VERSION`` argument must be compilant with the `cmake standard <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/command/project.html>`_.\\n  * Else, if the project is located inside a Git repository, the output of git description will be used.\\n  * Otherwise, ``PROJECT_VER`` will be \"1\".\\n- ``EXTRA_PARTITION_SUBTYPES``: CMake list of extra partition subtypes. Each subtype description is a comma-separated string with ``type_name, subtype_name, numeric_value`` format. Components may add new subtypes by appending them to this list.\\n\\nOther build properties are listed :ref:`here <cmake-build-properties>`.\\n\\n\\n.. _component_build_control:\\n\\nControlling Component Compilation\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n.. highlight:: cmake\\n\\nTo pass compiler options when compiling source files belonging to a particular component, use the `target_compile_options`_ function::\\n\\n  target_compile_options(${COMPONENT_LIB} PRIVATE -Wno-unused-variable)\\n\\nTo apply the compilation flags to a single source file, use the CMake `set_source_files_properties`_ command::\\n\\n    set_source_files_properties(mysrc.c\\n        PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS\\n        -Wno-unused-variable\\n    )\\n\\nThis can be useful if there is upstream code that emits warnings.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    CMake `set_source_files_properties`_ command is not applicable when the source files have been populated with help of the ``SRC_DIRS`` variable in ``idf_component_register``. See :ref:`cmake-file-globbing` for more details.\\n\\nWhen using these commands, place them after the call to ``idf_component_register`` in the component CMakeLists file.\\n\\n\\n.. _component-configuration:\\n\\nComponent Configuration\\n=======================\\n\\nEach component can also have a ``Kconfig`` file, alongside ``CMakeLists.txt``. This contains configuration settings to add to the configuration menu for this component.\\n\\nThese settings are found under the \"Component Settings\" menu when menuconfig is run.\\n\\nTo create a component Kconfig file, it is easiest to start with one of the Kconfig files distributed with ESP-IDF.\\n\\nFor an example, see `Adding conditional configuration`_.\\n\\n\\nPreprocessor Definitions\\n========================\\n\\nThe ESP-IDF build system adds the following C preprocessor definitions on the command line:\\n\\n- ``ESP_PLATFORM`` : Can be used to detect that build happens within ESP-IDF.\\n- ``IDF_VER`` : Defined to a git version string.  E.g. ``v2.0`` for a tagged release or ``v1.0-275-g0efaa4f`` for an arbitrary commit.\\n\\n\\n.. _component-requirements:\\n\\nComponent Requirements\\n======================\\n\\nWhen compiling each component, the ESP-IDF build system recursively evaluates its dependencies. This means each component needs to declare the components that it depends on (\"requires\").\\n\\n\\nWhen Writing a Component\\n------------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n   idf_component_register(...\\n                          REQUIRES mbedtls\\n                          PRIV_REQUIRES console spiffs)\\n\\n- ``REQUIRES`` should be set to all components whose header files are #included from the *public* header files of this component.\\n\\n- ``PRIV_REQUIRES`` should be set to all components whose header files are #included from *any source files* in this component, unless already listed in ``REQUIRES``. Also, any component which is required to be linked in order for this component to function correctly.\\n\\n- The values of ``REQUIRES`` and ``PRIV_REQUIRES`` should not depend on any configuration choices (``CONFIG_xxx`` macros). This is because requirements are expanded before the configuration is loaded. Other component variables (like include paths or source files) can depend on configuration choices.\\n\\n- Not setting either or both ``REQUIRES`` variables is fine. If the component has no requirements except for the `Common component requirements`_ needed for RTOS, libc, etc.\\n\\nIf a component only supports some target chips (values of ``IDF_TARGET``) then it can specify ``REQUIRED_IDF_TARGETS`` in the ``idf_component_register`` call to express these requirements. In this case, the build system will generate an error if the component is included in the build, but does not support the selected target.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  In CMake terms, ``REQUIRES`` & ``PRIV_REQUIRES`` are approximate wrappers around the CMake functions ``target_link_libraries(... PUBLIC ...)`` and ``target_link_libraries(... PRIVATE ...)``.\\n\\n\\n.. _example component requirements:\\n\\nExample of Component Requirements\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nImagine there is a ``car`` component, which uses the ``engine`` component, which uses the ``spark_plug`` component:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    - autoProject/\\n                 - CMakeLists.txt\\n                 - components/ - car/ - CMakeLists.txt\\n                                         - car.c\\n                                         - car.h\\n                               - engine/ - CMakeLists.txt\\n                                         - engine.c\\n                                         - include/ - engine.h\\n                               - spark_plug/  - CMakeLists.txt\\n                                              - spark_plug.c\\n                                              - spark_plug.h\\n\\n\\nCar Component\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. highlight:: c\\n\\nThe ``car.h`` header file is the public interface for the ``car`` component. This header includes ``engine.h`` directly because it uses some declarations from this header::\\n\\n  /* car.h */\\n  #include \"engine.h\"\\n\\n  #ifdef ENGINE_IS_HYBRID\\n  #define CAR_MODEL \"Hybrid\"\\n  #endif\\n\\nAnd car.c includes ``car.h`` as well::\\n\\n  /* car.c */\\n  #include \"car.h\"\\n\\nThis means the ``car/CMakeLists.txt`` file needs to declare that ``car`` requires ``engine``:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n  idf_component_register(SRCS \"car.c\"\\n                    INCLUDE_DIRS \".\"\\n                    REQUIRES engine)\\n\\n- ``SRCS`` gives the list of source files in the ``car`` component.\\n- ``INCLUDE_DIRS`` gives the list of public include directories for this component. Because the public interface is ``car.h``, the directory containing ``car.h`` is listed here.\\n- ``REQUIRES`` gives the list of components required by the public interface of this component. Because ``car.h`` is a public header and includes a header from ``engine``, we include ``engine`` here. This makes sure that any other component which includes ``car.h`` will be able to recursively include the required ``engine.h`` also.\\n\\n\\nEngine Component\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. highlight:: c\\n\\nThe ``engine`` component also has a public header file ``include/engine.h``, but this header is simpler::\\n\\n  /* engine.h */\\n  #define ENGINE_IS_HYBRID\\n\\n  void engine_start(void);\\n\\nThe implementation is in ``engine.c``::\\n\\n  /* engine.c */\\n  #include \"engine.h\"\\n  #include \"spark_plug.h\"\\n\\n  ...\\n\\nIn this component, ``engine`` depends on ``spark_plug`` but this is a private dependency. ``spark_plug.h`` is needed to compile ``engine.c``, but not needed to include ``engine.h``.\\n\\nThis means that the ``engine/CMakeLists.txt`` file can use ``PRIV_REQUIRES``:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n  idf_component_register(SRCS \"engine.c\"\\n                    INCLUDE_DIRS \"include\"\\n                    PRIV_REQUIRES spark_plug)\\n\\nAs a result, source files in the ``car`` component don\\'t need the ``spark_plug`` include directories added to their compiler search path. This can speed up compilation, and stops compiler command lines from becoming longer than necessary.\\n\\n\\nSpark Plug Component\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe ``spark_plug`` component doesn\\'t depend on anything else. It has a public header file ``spark_plug.h``, but this doesn\\'t include headers from any other components.\\n\\nThis means that the ``spark_plug/CMakeLists.txt`` file doesn\\'t need any ``REQUIRES`` or ``PRIV_REQUIRES`` clauses:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n  idf_component_register(SRCS \"spark_plug.c\"\\n                    INCLUDE_DIRS \".\")\\n\\n\\nSource File Include Directories\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nEach component\\'s source file is compiled with these include path directories, as specified in the passed arguments to ``idf_component_register``:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n  idf_component_register(..\\n                         INCLUDE_DIRS \"include\"\\n                         PRIV_INCLUDE_DIRS \"other\")\\n\\n\\n- The current component\\'s ``INCLUDE_DIRS`` and ``PRIV_INCLUDE_DIRS``.\\n- The ``INCLUDE_DIRS`` belonging to all other components listed in the ``REQUIRES`` and ``PRIV_REQUIRES`` parameters (ie all the current component\\'s public and private dependencies).\\n- Recursively, all of the ``INCLUDE_DIRS`` of those components ``REQUIRES`` lists (ie all public dependencies of this component\\'s dependencies, recursively expanded).\\n\\n\\nMain Component Requirements\\n---------------------------\\n\\nThe component named ``main`` is special because it automatically requires all other components in the build. So it\\'s not necessary to pass ``REQUIRES`` or ``PRIV_REQUIRES`` to this component. See :ref:`renaming main <rename-main>` for a description of what needs to be changed if no longer using the ``main`` component.\\n\\n\\n.. _component-common-requirements:\\n\\nCommon Component Requirements\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nTo avoid duplication, every component automatically requires some \"common\" IDF components even if they are not mentioned explicitly. Headers from these components can always be included.\\n\\nThe list of common components is: cxx, newlib, freertos, esp_hw_support, heap, log, soc, hal, esp_rom, esp_common, esp_system, xtensa/riscv.\\n\\n\\nIncluding Components in the Build\\n---------------------------------\\n\\n- By default, every component is included in the build.\\n- If you set the ``COMPONENTS`` variable to a minimal list of components used directly by your project, then the build will expand to also include required components. The full list of components will be:\\n\\n  - Components mentioned explicitly in ``COMPONENTS``.\\n  - Those components\\' requirements (evaluated recursively).\\n  - The \"common\" components that every component depends on.\\n\\n- Setting ``COMPONENTS`` to the minimal list of required components can significantly reduce compile times.\\n\\n\\n.. _component-circular-dependencies:\\n\\nCircular Dependencies\\n---------------------\\n\\nIt\\'s possible for a project to contain Component A that requires (``REQUIRES`` or ``PRIV_REQUIRES``) Component B, and Component B that requires Component A. This is known as a dependency cycle or a circular dependency.\\n\\nCMake will usually handle circular dependencies automatically by repeating the component library names twice on the linker command line. However this strategy doesn\\'t always work, and the build may fail with a linker error about \"Undefined reference to ...\", referencing a symbol defined by one of the components inside the circular dependency. This is particularly likely if there is a large circular dependency, i.e., A > B > C > D > A.\\n\\nThe best solution is to restructure the components to remove the circular dependency. In most cases, a software architecture without circular dependencies has desirable properties of modularity and clean layering and will be more maintainable in the long term. However, removing circular dependencies is not always possible.\\n\\nTo bypass a linker error caused by a circular dependency, the simplest workaround is to increase the CMake `LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY`_ property of one of the component libraries. This causes CMake to repeat this library and its dependencies more than two times on the linker command line.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n    set_property(TARGET ${COMPONENT_LIB} APPEND PROPERTY LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY 3)\\n\\n- This line should be placed after ``idf_component_register`` in the component CMakeLists.txt file.\\n- If possible, place this line in the component that creates the circular dependency by depending on a lot of other components. However, the line can be placed inside any component that is part of the cycle. Choosing the component that owns the source file shown in the linker error message, or the component that defines the symbol(s) mentioned in the linker error message, is a good place to start.\\n- Usually increasing the value to 3 (default is 2) is enough, but if this doesn\\'t work then try increasing the number further.\\n- Adding this option will make the linker command line longer, and the linking stage slower.\\n\\n\\nAdvanced Workaround: Undefined Symbols\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf only one or two symbols are causing a circular dependency, and all other dependencies are linear, then there is an alternative method to avoid linker errors: Specify the specific symbols required for the \"reverse\" dependency as undefined symbols at link time.\\n\\nFor example, if component A depends on component B but component B also needs to reference ``reverse_ops`` from component A (but nothing else), then you can add a line like the following to the component B CMakeLists.txt to resolve the cycle at link time:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n    # This symbol is provided by \\'Component A\\' at link time\\n    target_link_libraries(${COMPONENT_LIB} INTERFACE \"-u reverse_ops\")\\n\\n- The ``-u`` argument means that the linker will always include this symbol in the link, regardless of dependency ordering.\\n- This line should be placed after ``idf_component_register`` in the component CMakeLists.txt file.\\n- If \\'Component B\\' doesn\\'t need to access any headers of \\'Component A\\', only link to a few symbol(s), then this line can be used instead of any ``REQUIRES`` from B to A. This further simplifies the component structure in the build system.\\n\\nSee the `target_link_libraries`_ documentation for more information about this CMake function.\\n\\n\\n.. _component-requirements-implementation:\\n\\nRequirements in the Build System Implementation\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\n- Very early in the CMake configuration process, the script ``expand_requirements.cmake`` is run. This script does a partial evaluation of all component CMakeLists.txt files and builds a graph of component requirements (this :ref:`graph may have cycles <component-circular-dependencies>`). The graph is used to generate a file ``component_depends.cmake`` in the build directory.\\n- The main CMake process then includes this file and uses it to determine the list of components to include in the build (internal ``BUILD_COMPONENTS`` variable). The ``BUILD_COMPONENTS`` variable is sorted so dependencies are listed first, however, as the component dependency graph has cycles this cannot be guaranteed for all components. The order should be deterministic given the same set of components and component dependencies.\\n- The value of ``BUILD_COMPONENTS`` is logged by CMake as \"Component names: \"\\n- Configuration is then evaluated for the components included in the build.\\n- Each component is included in the build normally and the CMakeLists.txt file is evaluated again to add the component libraries to the build.\\n\\n\\nComponent Dependency Order\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe order of components in the ``BUILD_COMPONENTS`` variable determines other orderings during the build:\\n\\n- Order that :ref:`project_include.cmake` files are included in the project.\\n- Order that the list of header paths is generated for compilation (via ``-I`` argument). (Note that for a given component\\'s source files, only that component\\'s dependency\\'s header paths are passed to the compiler.)\\n\\n\\nAdding Link-Time Dependencies\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. highlight:: cmake\\n\\nThe ESP-IDF CMake helper function ``idf_component_add_link_dependency`` adds a link-only dependency between one component and another. In almost all cases, it is better to use the ``PRIV_REQUIRES`` feature in ``idf_component_register`` to create a dependency. However, in some cases, it\\'s necessary to add the link-time dependency of another component to this component, i.e., the reverse order to ``PRIV_REQUIRES`` (for example: :doc:`/api-reference/peripherals/spi_flash/spi_flash_override_driver`).\\n\\nTo make another component depend on this component at link time::\\n\\n  idf_component_add_link_dependency(FROM other_component)\\n\\nPlace this line after the line with ``idf_component_register``.\\n\\nIt\\'s also possible to specify both components by name::\\n\\n  idf_component_add_link_dependency(FROM other_component TO that_component)\\n\\n\\n.. _override_project_config:\\n\\nOverriding Parts of the Project\\n===============================\\n\\n.. _project_include.cmake:\\n\\nProject_include.cmake\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor components that have build requirements that must be evaluated before any component CMakeLists files are evaluated, you can create a file called ``project_include.cmake`` in the component directory. This CMake file is included when ``project.cmake`` is evaluating the entire project.\\n\\n``project_include.cmake`` files are used inside ESP-IDF, for defining project-wide build features such as ``esptool.py`` command line arguments and the ``bootloader`` \"special app\".\\n\\nUnlike component ``CMakeLists.txt`` files, when including a ``project_include.cmake`` file the current source directory (``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`` and working directory) is the project directory. Use the variable ``COMPONENT_DIR`` for the absolute directory of the component.\\n\\nNote that ``project_include.cmake`` isn\\'t necessary for the most common component uses, such as adding include directories to the project, or ``LDFLAGS`` to the final linking step. These values can be customized via the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file itself. See `Optional Project Variables`_ for details.\\n\\n``project_include.cmake`` files are included in the order given in ``BUILD_COMPONENTS`` variable (as logged by CMake). This means that a component\\'s ``project_include.cmake`` file will be included after it\\'s all dependencies\\' ``project_include.cmake`` files, unless both components are part of a dependency cycle. This is important if a ``project_include.cmake`` file relies on variables set by another component. See also :ref:`above <component-requirements-implementation>`.\\n\\nTake great care when setting variables or targets in a ``project_include.cmake`` file. As the values are included in the top-level project CMake pass, they can influence or break functionality across all components!\\n\\n\\nKConfig.projbuild\\n-----------------\\n\\nThis is an equivalent to ``project_include.cmake`` for :ref:`component-configuration` KConfig files. If you want to include configuration options at the top level of menuconfig, rather than inside the \"Component Configuration\" sub-menu, then these can be defined in the KConfig.projbuild file alongside the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file.\\n\\nTake care when adding configuration values in this file, as they will be included across the entire project configuration. Where possible, it\\'s generally better to create a KConfig file for :ref:`component-configuration`.\\n\\n\\nWrappers to Redefine or Extend Existing Functions\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThanks to the linker\\'s wrap feature, it is possible to redefine or extend the behavior of an existing ESP-IDF function. To do so, you will need to provide the following CMake declaration in your project\\'s ``CMakeLists.txt`` file:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n    target_link_libraries(${COMPONENT_LIB} INTERFACE \"-Wl,--wrap=function_to_redefine\")\\n\\nWhere ``function_to_redefine`` is the name of the function to redefine or extend. This option will let the linker replace all the calls to ``function_to_redefine`` functions in the binary libraries with calls to ``__wrap_function_to_redefine`` function. Thus, you must define this new symbol in your application.\\n\\nThe linker will provide a new symbol named ``__real_function_to_redefine`` which points to the former implementation of the function to redefine. It can be called from the new implementation, making it an extension of the former one.\\n\\nThis mechanism is shown in the example :example:`build_system/wrappers`. Check :idf_file:`examples/build_system/wrappers/README.md` for more details.\\n\\n\\nOverride the Default Bootloader\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nThanks to the optional ``bootloader_components`` directory present in your ESP-IDf project, it is possible to override the default ESP-IDF bootloader. To do so, a new ``bootloader_components/main`` component should be defined, which will make the project directory tree look like the following:\\n\\n    - myProject/\\n                 - CMakeLists.txt\\n                 - sdkconfig\\n                 - bootloader_components/ - main/ - CMakeLists.txt\\n                                                  - Kconfig\\n                                                  - my_bootloader.c\\n                 - main/       - CMakeLists.txt\\n                               - app_main.c\\n\\n                 - build/\\n\\n\\nHere the ``my_bootloader.c`` file becomes source code for the new bootloader, which means that it will need to perform all the required operations to set up and load the ``main`` application from flash.\\n\\nIt is also possible to conditionally replace the bootloader depending on a certain condition, such as the target for example. This can be achieved thanks to the ``BOOTLOADER_IGNORE_EXTRA_COMPONENT`` CMake variable. This list can be used to tell the ESP-IDF bootloader project to ignore and not compile the given components present in ``bootloader_components``. For example, if one wants to use the default bootloader for ESP32 target, then ``myProject/CMakeLists.txt`` should look like the following::\\n\\n    include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/project.cmake)\\n\\n    if(${IDF_TARGET} STREQUAL \"esp32\")\\n        set(BOOTLOADER_IGNORE_EXTRA_COMPONENT \"main\")\\n    endif()\\n\\n    project(main)\\n\\nIt is important to note that this can also be used for any other bootloader components than ``main``. In all cases, the prefix ``bootloader_component`` must not be specified.\\n\\nSee :example:`custom_bootloader/bootloader_override` for an example of overriding the default bootloader.\\n\\n\\n.. _config_only_component:\\n\\nConfiguration-Only Components\\n=============================\\n\\nSpecial components which contain no source files, only ``Kconfig.projbuild`` and ``KConfig``, can have a one-line ``CMakeLists.txt`` file which calls the function ``idf_component_register()`` with no arguments specified. This function will include the component in the project build, but no library will be built *and* no header files will be added to any included paths.\\n\\n\\nDebugging CMake\\n===============\\n\\nFor full details about CMake_ and CMake commands, see the `CMake v3.16 documentation`_.\\n\\nSome tips for debugging the ESP-IDF CMake-based build system:\\n\\n- When CMake runs, it prints quite a lot of diagnostic information including lists of components and component paths.\\n- Running ``cmake -DDEBUG=1`` will produce more verbose diagnostic output from the IDF build system.\\n- Running ``cmake`` with the ``--trace`` or ``--trace-expand`` options will give a lot of information about control flow. See the `cmake command line documentation`_.\\n\\nWhen included from a project CMakeLists file, the ``project.cmake`` file defines some utility modules and global variables and then sets ``IDF_PATH`` if it was not set in the system environment.\\n\\nIt also defines an overridden custom version of the built-in CMake_ ``project`` function. This function is overridden to add all of the ESP-IDF specific project functionality.\\n\\n\\n.. _warn-undefined-variables:\\n\\nWarning On Undefined Variables\\n------------------------------\\n\\nBy default, the function of warnings on undefined variables is disabled.\\n\\nTo enable this function, we can pass the ``--warn-uninitialized`` flag to CMake_ or pass the ``--cmake-warn-uninitialized`` flag to ``idf.py`` so it will print a warning if an undefined variable is referenced in the build. This can be very useful to find buggy CMake files.\\n\\nBrowse the :idf_file:`/tools/cmake/project.cmake` file and supporting functions in :idf:`/tools/cmake/` for more details.\\n\\n\\n.. _component_cmakelists_example:\\n\\n\\nExample Component CMakeLists\\n============================\\n\\nBecause the build environment tries to set reasonable defaults that will work most of the time, component ``CMakeLists.txt`` can be very small or even empty (see `Minimal Component CMakeLists`_). However, overriding `preset_component_variables`_ is usually required for some functionality.\\n\\nHere are some more advanced examples of component CMakeLists files.\\n\\n\\n.. _add_conditional_config:\\n\\nAdding Conditional Configuration\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThe configuration system can be used to conditionally compile some files depending on the options selected in the project configuration.\\n\\n.. highlight:: none\\n\\n``Kconfig``::\\n\\n    config FOO_ENABLE_BAR\\n        bool \"Enable the BAR feature.\"\\n        help\\n            This enables the BAR feature of the FOO component.\\n\\n``CMakeLists.txt``::\\n\\n    set(srcs \"foo.c\" \"more_foo.c\")\\n\\n    if(CONFIG_FOO_ENABLE_BAR)\\n        list(APPEND srcs \"bar.c\")\\n    endif()\\n\\n   idf_component_register(SRCS \"${srcs}\"\\n                        ...)\\n\\nThis example makes use of the CMake `if <cmake if_>`_ function and `list APPEND <cmake list_>`_ function.\\n\\nThis can also be used to select or stub out an implementation, as such:\\n\\n``Kconfig``::\\n\\n    config ENABLE_LCD_OUTPUT\\n        bool \"Enable LCD output.\"\\n        help\\n            Select this if your board has an LCD.\\n\\n    config ENABLE_LCD_CONSOLE\\n        bool \"Output console text to LCD\"\\n        depends on ENABLE_LCD_OUTPUT\\n        help\\n            Select this to output debugging output to the LCD\\n\\n    config ENABLE_LCD_PLOT\\n        bool \"Output temperature plots to LCD\"\\n        depends on ENABLE_LCD_OUTPUT\\n        help\\n            Select this to output temperature plots\\n\\n.. highlight:: cmake\\n\\n``CMakeLists.txt``::\\n\\n    if(CONFIG_ENABLE_LCD_OUTPUT)\\n       set(srcs lcd-real.c lcd-spi.c)\\n    else()\\n       set(srcs lcd-dummy.c)\\n    endif()\\n\\n    # We need font if either console or plot is enabled\\n    if(CONFIG_ENABLE_LCD_CONSOLE OR CONFIG_ENABLE_LCD_PLOT)\\n       list(APPEND srcs \"font.c\")\\n    endif()\\n\\n    idf_component_register(SRCS \"${srcs}\"\\n                        ...)\\n\\n\\nConditions Which Depend on the Target\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nThe current target is available to CMake files via ``IDF_TARGET`` variable.\\n\\nIn addition to that, if target ``xyz`` is used (``IDF_TARGET=xyz``), then Kconfig variable ``CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_XYZ`` will be set.\\n\\nNote that component dependencies may depend on ``IDF_TARGET`` variable, but not on Kconfig variables. Also one can not use Kconfig variables in ``include`` statements in CMake files, but ``IDF_TARGET`` can be used in such context.\\n\\n\\nSource Code Generation\\n----------------------\\n\\nSome components will have a situation where a source file isn\\'t supplied with the component itself but has to be generated from another file. Say our component has a header file that consists of the converted binary data of a BMP file, converted using a hypothetical tool called bmp2h. The header file is then included in as C source file called graphics_lib.c::\\n\\n    add_custom_command(OUTPUT logo.h\\n         COMMAND bmp2h -i ${COMPONENT_DIR}/logo.bmp -o log.h\\n         DEPENDS ${COMPONENT_DIR}/logo.bmp\\n         VERBATIM)\\n\\n    add_custom_target(logo DEPENDS logo.h)\\n    add_dependencies(${COMPONENT_LIB} logo)\\n\\n    set_property(DIRECTORY \"${COMPONENT_DIR}\" APPEND PROPERTY\\n         ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES logo.h)\\n\\nThis answer is adapted from the `CMake FAQ entry <cmake faq generated files_>`_, which contains some other examples that will also work with ESP-IDF builds.\\n\\nIn this example, logo.h will be generated in the current directory (the build directory) while logo.bmp comes with the component and resides under the component path. Because logo.h is a generated file, it should be cleaned when the project is cleaned. For this reason, it is added to the `ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES`_ property.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   If generating files as part of the project CMakeLists.txt file, not a component CMakeLists.txt, then use build property ``PROJECT_DIR`` instead of ``${COMPONENT_DIR}`` and ``${PROJECT_NAME}.elf`` instead of ``${COMPONENT_LIB}``.)\\n\\nIf a a source file from another component included ``logo.h``, then ``add_dependencies`` would need to be called to add a dependency between the two components, to ensure that the component source files were always compiled in the correct order.\\n\\n\\n.. _cmake_embed_data:\\n\\nEmbedding Binary Data\\n---------------------\\n\\nSometimes you have a file with some binary or text data that you\\'d like to make available to your component, but you don\\'t want to reformat the file as a C source.\\n\\nYou can specify argument ``EMBED_FILES`` in the component registration, giving space-delimited names of the files to embed::\\n\\n  idf_component_register(...\\n                         EMBED_FILES server_root_cert.der)\\n\\nOr if the file is a string, you can use the variable ``EMBED_TXTFILES``. This will embed the contents of the text file as a null-terminated string::\\n\\n  idf_component_register(...\\n                         EMBED_TXTFILES server_root_cert.pem)\\n\\n.. highlight:: c\\n\\nThe file\\'s contents will be added to the .rodata section in flash, and are available via symbol names as follows::\\n\\n  extern const uint8_t server_root_cert_pem_start[] asm(\"_binary_server_root_cert_pem_start\");\\n  extern const uint8_t server_root_cert_pem_end[]   asm(\"_binary_server_root_cert_pem_end\");\\n\\nThe names are generated from the full name of the file, as given in ``EMBED_FILES``. Characters /, ., etc. are replaced with underscores. The _binary prefix in the symbol name is added by objcopy and is the same for both text and binary files.\\n\\n.. highlight:: cmake\\n\\nTo embed a file into a project, rather than a component, you can call the function ``target_add_binary_data`` like this::\\n\\n  target_add_binary_data(myproject.elf \"main/data.bin\" TEXT)\\n\\nPlace this line after the ``project()`` line in your project CMakeLists.txt file. Replace ``myproject.elf`` with your project name. The final argument can be ``TEXT`` to embed a null-terminated string, or ``BINARY`` to embed the content as-is.\\n\\nFor an example of using this technique, see the \"main\" component of the file_serving example :example_file:`protocols/http_server/file_serving/main/CMakeLists.txt` - two files are loaded at build time and linked into the firmware.\\n\\n.. highlight:: cmake\\n\\nIt is also possible to embed a generated file::\\n\\n  add_custom_command(OUTPUT my_processed_file.bin\\n                    COMMAND my_process_file_cmd my_unprocessed_file.bin)\\n  target_add_binary_data(my_target \"my_processed_file.bin\" BINARY)\\n\\nIn the example above, ``my_processed_file.bin`` is generated from ``my_unprocessed_file.bin`` through some command ``my_process_file_cmd``, then embedded into the target.\\n\\nTo specify a dependence on a target, use the ``DEPENDS`` argument::\\n\\n  add_custom_target(my_process COMMAND ...)\\n  target_add_binary_data(my_target \"my_embed_file.bin\" BINARY DEPENDS my_process)\\n\\nThe ``DEPENDS`` argument to ``target_add_binary_data`` ensures that the target executes first.\\n\\n\\nCode and Data Placements\\n------------------------\\n\\nESP-IDF has a feature called linker script generation that enables components to define where its code and data will be placed in memory through linker fragment files. These files are processed by the build system, and is used to augment the linker script used for linking app binary. See :doc:`Linker Script Generation <linker-script-generation>` for a quick start guide as well as a detailed discussion of the mechanism.\\n\\n\\n.. _component-build-full-override:\\n\\nFully Overriding the Component Build Process\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\n.. highlight:: cmake\\n\\nObviously, there are cases where all these recipes are insufficient for a certain component, for example when the component is basically a wrapper around another third-party component not originally intended to be compiled under this build system. In that case, it\\'s possible to forego the ESP-IDF build system entirely by using a CMake feature called ExternalProject_. Example component CMakeLists::\\n\\n  # External build process for quirc, runs in source dir and\\n  # produces libquirc.a\\n  externalproject_add(quirc_build\\n      PREFIX ${COMPONENT_DIR}\\n      SOURCE_DIR ${COMPONENT_DIR}/quirc\\n      CONFIGURE_COMMAND \"\"\\n      BUILD_IN_SOURCE 1\\n      BUILD_COMMAND make CC=${CMAKE_C_COMPILER} libquirc.a\\n      INSTALL_COMMAND \"\"\\n      )\\n\\n   # Add libquirc.a to the build process\\n   add_library(quirc STATIC IMPORTED GLOBAL)\\n   add_dependencies(quirc quirc_build)\\n\\n   set_target_properties(quirc PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION\\n        ${COMPONENT_DIR}/quirc/libquirc.a)\\n   set_target_properties(quirc PROPERTIES INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES\\n        ${COMPONENT_DIR}/quirc/lib)\\n\\n   set_directory_properties( PROPERTIES ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES\\n        \"${COMPONENT_DIR}/quirc/libquirc.a\")\\n\\n(The above CMakeLists.txt can be used to create a component named ``quirc`` that builds the quirc_ project using its own Makefile.)\\n\\n- ``externalproject_add`` defines an external build system.\\n\\n  - ``SOURCE_DIR``, ``CONFIGURE_COMMAND``, ``BUILD_COMMAND`` and ``INSTALL_COMMAND`` should always be set. ``CONFIGURE_COMMAND`` can be set to an empty string if the build system has no \"configure\" step. ``INSTALL_COMMAND`` will generally be empty for ESP-IDF builds.\\n  - Setting ``BUILD_IN_SOURCE`` means the build directory is the same as the source directory. Otherwise, you can set ``BUILD_DIR``.\\n  - Consult the ExternalProject_ documentation for more details about ``externalproject_add()``\\n\\n- The second set of commands adds a library target, which points to the \"imported\" library file built by the external system. Some properties need to be set in order to add include directories and tell CMake where this file is.\\n- Finally, the generated library is added to `ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES`_. This means ``make clean`` will delete this library. (Note that the other object files from the build won\\'t be deleted.)\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n   .. note:: When using an external build process with PSRAM, remember to add ``-mfix-esp32-psram-cache-issue`` to the C compiler arguments. See :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_WORKAROUND` for details of this flag.\\n\\n\\n.. _ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES_note:\\n\\nExternalProject Dependencies and Clean Builds\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nCMake has some unusual behavior around external project builds:\\n\\n- `ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES`_ only works when \"make\" or \"ninja\" is used as the build system. If an IDE build system is used, it won\\'t delete these files when cleaning.\\n- However, the ExternalProject_ configure & build commands will *always* be re-run after a clean is run.\\n- Therefore, there are two alternative recommended ways to configure the external build command:\\n\\n    1. Have the external ``BUILD_COMMAND`` run a full clean compile of all sources. The build command will be run if any of the dependencies passed to ``externalproject_add`` with ``DEPENDS`` have changed, or if this is a clean build (ie any of ``idf.py clean``, ``ninja clean``, or ``make clean`` was run.)\\n    2. Have the external ``BUILD_COMMAND`` be an incremental build command. Pass the parameter ``BUILD_ALWAYS 1`` to ``externalproject_add``. This means the external project will be built each time a build is run, regardless of dependencies. This is only recommended if the external project has correct incremental build behavior, and doesn\\'t take too long to run.\\n\\nThe best of these approaches for building an external project will depend on the project itself, its build system, and whether you anticipate needing to frequently recompile the project.\\n\\n\\n.. _custom-sdkconfig-defaults:\\n\\nCustom Sdkconfig Defaults\\n=========================\\n\\nFor example projects or other projects where you don\\'t want to specify a full sdkconfig configuration, but you do want to override some key values from the ESP-IDF defaults, it is possible to create a file ``sdkconfig.defaults`` in the project directory. This file will be used when creating a new config from scratch, or when any new config value hasn\\'t yet been set in the ``sdkconfig`` file.\\n\\nTo override the name of this file or to specify multiple files, set the ``SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS`` environment variable or set ``SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS`` in top-level ``CMakeLists.txt``. File names that are not specified as full paths are resolved relative to current project\\'s directory.\\n\\nWhen specifying multiple files, use a semicolon as the list separator. Files listed first will be applied first. If a particular key is defined in multiple files, the definition in the latter file will override definitions from former files.\\n\\nSome of the IDF examples include a ``sdkconfig.ci`` file. This is part of the continuous integration (CI) test framework and is ignored by the normal build process.\\n\\n\\nTarget-dependent Sdkconfig Defaults\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nIf and only if an ``sdkconfig.defaults`` file exists, the build system will also attempt to load defaults from an ``sdkconfig.defaults.TARGET_NAME`` file, where ``TARGET_NAME`` is the value of ``IDF_TARGET``. For example, for ``esp32`` target, default settings will be taken from ``sdkconfig.defaults`` first, and then from ``sdkconfig.defaults.esp32``. If there are no generic default settings, an empty ``sdkconfig.defaults`` still needs to be created if the build system should recognize any additional target-dependent ``sdkconfig.defaults.TARGET_NAME`` files.\\n\\nIf ``SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS`` is used to override the name of defaults file/files, the name of target-specific defaults file will be derived from ``SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS`` value/values using the rule above. When there are multiple files in ``SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS``, target-specific file will be applied right after the file bringing it in, before all latter files in ``SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS``\\n\\nFor example, if ``SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=\"sdkconfig.defaults;sdkconfig_devkit1\"``, and there is a file ``sdkconfig.defaults.esp32`` in the same folder, then the files will be applied in the following order: (1) sdkconfig.defaults (2) sdkconfig.defaults.esp32 (3) sdkconfig_devkit1.\\n\\n\\n.. _flash_parameters:\\n\\nFlash Arguments\\n===============\\n\\nThere are some scenarios that we want to flash the target board without IDF. For this case we want to save the built binaries, esptool.py and esptool write_flash arguments. It\\'s simple to write a script to save binaries and esptool.py.\\n\\nAfter running a project build, the build directory contains binary output files (``.bin`` files) for the project and also the following flashing data files:\\n\\n- ``flash_project_args`` contains arguments to flash the entire project (app, bootloader, partition table, PHY data if this is configured).\\n- ``flash_app_args`` contains arguments to flash only the app.\\n- ``flash_bootloader_args`` contains arguments to flash only the bootloader.\\n\\n.. highlight:: bash\\n\\nYou can pass any of these flasher argument files to ``esptool.py`` as follows::\\n\\n  python esptool.py --chip esp32 write_flash @build/flash_project_args\\n\\nAlternatively, it is possible to manually copy the parameters from the argument file and pass them on the command line.\\n\\nThe build directory also contains a generated file ``flasher_args.json`` which contains project flash information, in JSON format. This file is used by ``idf.py`` and can also be used by other tools which need information about the project build.\\n\\n\\nBuilding the Bootloader\\n=======================\\n\\nThe bootloader is a special \"subproject\" inside :idf:`/components/bootloader/subproject`. It has its own project CMakeLists.txt file and builds separate .ELF and .BIN files to the main project. However, it shares its configuration and build directory with the main project.\\n\\nThe subproject is inserted as an external project from the top-level project, by the file :idf_file:`/components/bootloader/project_include.cmake`. The main build process runs CMake for the subproject, which includes discovering components (a subset of the main components) and generating a bootloader-specific config (derived from the main ``sdkconfig``).\\n\\n\\n.. _write-pure-component:\\n\\nWriting Pure CMake Components\\n=============================\\n\\nThe ESP-IDF build system \"wraps\" CMake with the concept of \"components\", and helper functions to automatically integrate these components into a project build.\\n\\nHowever, underneath the concept of \"components\" is a full CMake build system. It is also possible to make a component which is pure CMake.\\n\\n.. highlight:: cmake\\n\\nHere is an example minimal \"pure CMake\" component CMakeLists file for a component named ``json``::\\n\\n  add_library(json STATIC\\n  cJSON/cJSON.c\\n  cJSON/cJSON_Utils.c)\\n\\n  target_include_directories(json PUBLIC cJSON)\\n\\n- This is actually an equivalent declaration to the IDF ``json`` component :idf_file:`/components/json/CMakeLists.txt`.\\n- This file is quite simple as there are not a lot of source files. For components with a large number of files, the globbing behavior of ESP-IDF\\'s component logic can make the component CMakeLists style simpler.)\\n- Any time a component adds a library target with the component name, the ESP-IDF build system will automatically add this to the build, expose public include directories, etc. If a component wants to add a library target with a different name, dependencies will need to be added manually via CMake commands.\\n\\n\\nUsing Third-Party CMake Projects with Components\\n================================================\\n\\nCMake is used for a lot of open-source C and C++ projects — code that users can tap into for their applications. One of the benefits of having a CMake build system is the ability to import these third-party projects, sometimes even without modification! This allows for users to be able to get functionality that may not yet be provided by a component, or use another library for the same functionality.\\n\\n.. highlight:: cmake\\n\\nImporting a library might look like this for a hypothetical library ``foo`` to be used in the ``main`` component::\\n\\n  # Register the component\\n  idf_component_register(...)\\n\\n  # Set values of hypothetical variables that control the build of `foo`\\n  set(FOO_BUILD_STATIC OFF)\\n  set(FOO_BUILD_TESTS OFF)\\n\\n  # Create and import the library targets\\n  add_subdirectory(foo)\\n\\n  # Publicly link `foo` to `main` component\\n  target_link_libraries(main PUBLIC foo)\\n\\nFor an actual example, take a look at :example:`build_system/cmake/import_lib`. Take note that what needs to be done in order to import the library may vary. It is recommended to read up on the library\\'s documentation for instructions on how to import it from other projects. Studying the library\\'s CMakeLists.txt and build structure can also be helpful.\\n\\nIt is also possible to wrap a third-party library to be used as a component in this manner. For example, the :component:`mbedtls` component is a wrapper for Espressif\\'s fork of `mbedtls <https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls>`_. See its :component_file:`component CMakeLists.txt <mbedtls/CMakeLists.txt>`.\\n\\nThe CMake variable ``ESP_PLATFORM`` is set to 1 whenever the ESP-IDF build system is being used. Tests such as ``if (ESP_PLATFORM)`` can be used in generic CMake code if special IDF-specific logic is required.\\n\\n\\nUsing ESP-IDF Components from External Libraries\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe above example assumes that the external library ``foo`` (or ``tinyxml`` in the case of the ``import_lib`` example) doesn\\'t need to use any ESP-IDF APIs apart from common APIs such as libc, libstdc++, etc. If the external library needs to use APIs provided by other ESP-IDF components, this needs to be specified in the external CMakeLists.txt file by adding a dependency on the library target ``idf::<componentname>``.\\n\\nFor example, in the ``foo/CMakeLists.txt`` file::\\n\\n  add_library(foo bar.c fizz.cpp buzz.cpp)\\n\\n  if(ESP_PLATFORM)\\n    # On ESP-IDF, bar.c needs to include esp_flash.h from the spi_flash component\\n    target_link_libraries(foo PRIVATE idf::spi_flash)\\n  endif()\\n\\n\\nUsing Prebuilt Libraries with Components\\n========================================\\n\\n.. highlight:: cmake\\n\\nAnother possibility is that you have a prebuilt static library (``.a`` file), built by some other build process.\\n\\nThe ESP-IDF build system provides a utility function ``add_prebuilt_library`` for users to be able to easily import and use prebuilt libraries::\\n\\n  add_prebuilt_library(target_name lib_path [REQUIRES req1 req2 ...] [PRIV_REQUIRES req1 req2 ...])\\n\\nwhere:\\n\\n- ``target_name``- name that can be used to reference the imported library, such as when linking to other targets\\n- ``lib_path``- path to prebuilt library; may be an absolute or relative path to the component directory\\n\\nOptional arguments ``REQUIRES`` and ``PRIV_REQUIRES`` specify dependency on other components. These have the same meaning as the arguments for ``idf_component_register``.\\n\\nTake note that the prebuilt library must have been compiled for the same target as the consuming project. Configuration relevant to the prebuilt library must also match. If not paid attention to, these two factors may contribute to subtle bugs in the app.\\n\\nFor an example, take a look at :example:`build_system/cmake/import_prebuilt`.\\n\\n\\nUsing ESP-IDF in Custom CMake Projects\\n======================================\\n\\nESP-IDF provides a template CMake project for easily creating an application. However, in some instances the user might already have an existing CMake project or may want to create a custom one. In these cases it is desirable to be able to consume IDF components as libraries to be linked to the user\\'s targets (libraries/executables).\\n\\nIt is possible to do so by using the :ref:`build system APIs provided <cmake_buildsystem_api>` by :idf_file:`tools/cmake/idf.cmake`. For example:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n  cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)\\n  project(my_custom_app C)\\n\\n  # Include CMake file that provides ESP-IDF CMake build system APIs.\\n  include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/idf.cmake)\\n\\n  # Include ESP-IDF components in the build, may be thought as an equivalent of\\n  # add_subdirectory() but with some additional processing and magic for ESP-IDF build\\n  # specific build processes.\\n  idf_build_process(esp32)\\n\\n  # Create the project executable and plainly link the newlib component to it using\\n  # its alias, idf::newlib.\\n  add_executable(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}.elf main.c)\\n  target_link_libraries(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}.elf idf::newlib)\\n\\n  # Let the build system know what the project executable is to attach more targets, dependencies, etc.\\n  idf_build_executable(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}.elf)\\n\\nThe example in :example:`build_system/cmake/idf_as_lib` demonstrates the creation of an application equivalent to :example:`hello world application <get-started/hello_world>` using a custom CMake project.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n   .. note:: The IDF build system can only set compiler flags for source files that it builds. When an external CMakeLists.txt file is used and PSRAM is enabled, remember to add ``-mfix-esp32-psram-cache-issue`` to the C compiler arguments. See :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_WORKAROUND` for details of this flag.\\n\\n\\n.. _cmake_buildsystem_api:\\n\\nESP-IDF CMake Build System API\\n==============================\\n\\nIdf-build-commands\\n------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n  idf_build_get_property(var property [GENERATOR_EXPRESSION])\\n\\nRetrieve a :ref:`build property <cmake-build-properties>` *property* and store it in *var* accessible from the current scope.

Specifying *APPEND* will append the specified value to the current value of the property. If the property does not previously exist or it is currently empty, the specified value becomes the first element/member instead.\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n  idf_build_component(component_dir)\\n\\nPresent a directory *component_dir* that contains a component to the build system. Relative paths are converted to absolute paths with respect to current directory.\\nAll calls to this command must be performed before `idf_build_process`.\\n\\nThis command does not guarantee that the component will be processed during build (see the `COMPONENTS` argument description for `idf_build_process`)\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n  idf_build_process(target\\n                    [PROJECT_DIR project_dir]\\n                    [PROJECT_VER project_ver]\\n                    [PROJECT_NAME project_name]\\n                    [SDKCONFIG sdkconfig]\\n                    [SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS sdkconfig_defaults]\\n                    [BUILD_DIR build_dir]\\n                    [COMPONENTS component1 component2 ...])\\n\\nPerforms the bulk of the behind-the-scenes magic for including ESP-IDF components such as component configuration, libraries creation, dependency expansion and resolution. Among these functions, perhaps the most important from a user\\'s perspective is the libraries creation by calling each component\\'s ``idf_component_register``. This command creates the libraries for each component, which are accessible using aliases in the form idf::*component_name*.\\nThese aliases can be used to link the components to the user\\'s own targets, either libraries or executables.\\n\\nThe call requires the target chip to be specified with *target* argument. Optional arguments for the call include:\\n\\n- PROJECT_DIR - directory of the project; defaults to CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR\\n- PROJECT_NAME - name of the project; defaults to CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME\\n- PROJECT_VER - version/revision of the project; defaults to \"1\"\\n- SDKCONFIG - output path of generated sdkconfig file; defaults to PROJECT_DIR/sdkconfig or CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR/sdkconfig depending if PROJECT_DIR is set\\n- SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS - list of files containing default config to use in the build (list must contain full paths); defaults to empty. For each value *filename* in the list, the config from file *filename.target*, if it exists, is also loaded.\\n- BUILD_DIR - directory to place ESP-IDF build-related artifacts, such as generated binaries, text files, components; defaults to CMAKE_BINARY_DIR\\n- COMPONENTS - select components to process among the components known by the build system (added via `idf_build_component`). This argument is used to trim the build.\\n  Other components are automatically added if they are required in the dependency chain, i.e., the public and private requirements of the components in this list are automatically added, and in turn the public and private requirements of those requirements, so on and so forth. If not specified, all components known to the build system are processed.\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n  idf_build_executable(executable)\\n\\nSpecify the executable *executable* for ESP-IDF build. This attaches additional targets such as dependencies related to flashing, generating additional binary files, etc. Should be called after ``idf_build_process``.\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n  idf_build_get_config(var config [GENERATOR_EXPRESSION])\\n\\nGet the value of the specified config. Much like build properties, specifying *GENERATOR_EXPRESSION* will retrieve the generator expression string for that config, instead of the actual value, which can be used with CMake commands that support generator expressions. Actual config values are only known after call to ``idf_build_process``, however.\\n\\n\\n.. _cmake-build-properties:\\n\\nIdf-build-properties\\n--------------------\\n\\nThese are properties that describe the build. Values of build properties can be retrieved by using the build command ``idf_build_get_property``. For example, to get the Python interpreter used for the build:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n  idf_build_get_property(python PYTHON)\\n  message(STATUS \"The Python intepreter is: ${python}\")\\n\\n- BUILD_DIR - build directory; set from ``idf_build_process`` BUILD_DIR argument\\n- BUILD_COMPONENTS - list of components included in the build; set by ``idf_build_process``\\n- BUILD_COMPONENT_ALIASES - list of library alias of components included in the build; set by ``idf_build_process``\\n- C_COMPILE_OPTIONS - compile options applied to all components\\' C source files\\n- COMPILE_OPTIONS - compile options applied to all components\\' source files, regardless of it being C or C++\\n- COMPILE_DEFINITIONS - compile definitions applied to all component source files\\n- CXX_COMPILE_OPTIONS - compile options applied to all components\\' C++ source files\\n- DEPENDENCIES_LOCK - lock file path used in component manager. The default value is `dependencies.lock` under the project path.\\n- EXECUTABLE - project executable; set by call to ``idf_build_executable``\\n- EXECUTABLE_NAME - name of project executable without extension; set by call to ``idf_build_executable``\\n- EXECUTABLE_DIR - path containing the output executable\\n- IDF_COMPONENT_MANAGER - the component manager is enabled by default, but if this property is set to ``0`` it was disabled by the IDF_COMPONENT_MANAGER environment variable\\n- IDF_PATH - ESP-IDF path; set from IDF_PATH environment variable, if not, inferred from the location of ``idf.cmake``\\n- IDF_TARGET - target chip for the build; set from the required target argument for ``idf_build_process``\\n- IDF_VER - ESP-IDF version; set from either a version file or the Git revision of the IDF_PATH repository\\n- INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES - include directories for all component source files\\n- KCONFIGS - list of Kconfig files found in components in build; set by ``idf_build_process``\\n- KCONFIG_PROJBUILDS - list of Kconfig.projbuild files found in components in build; set by ``idf_build_process``\\n- PROJECT_NAME - name of the project; set from ``idf_build_process`` PROJECT_NAME argument\\n- PROJECT_DIR - directory of the project; set from ``idf_build_process`` PROJECT_DIR argument\\n- PROJECT_VER - version of the project; set from ``idf_build_process`` PROJECT_VER argument\\n- PYTHON - Python interpreter used for the build; set from PYTHON environment variable if available, if not \"python\" is used\\n- SDKCONFIG - full path to output config file; set from ``idf_build_process`` SDKCONFIG argument\\n- SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS - list of files containing default config to use in the build; set from ``idf_build_process`` SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS argument\\n- SDKCONFIG_HEADER - full path to C/C++ header file containing component configuration; set by ``idf_build_process``\\n- SDKCONFIG_CMAKE - full path to CMake file containing component configuration; set by ``idf_build_process``\\n- SDKCONFIG_JSON - full path to JSON file containing component configuration; set by ``idf_build_process``\\n- SDKCONFIG_JSON_MENUS - full path to JSON file containing config menus; set by ``idf_build_process``\\n\\n\\nIdf-component-commands\\n----------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n  idf_component_get_property(var component property [GENERATOR_EXPRESSION])\\n\\nRetrieve a specified *component*\\'s :ref:`component property <cmake-component-properties>`, *property* and store it in *var* accessible from the current scope.

Much like the ``project()`` CMake command, this should be called from the component\\'s CMakeLists.txt directly (not through a function or macro) and is recommended to be called before any other command. Here are some guidelines on what commands can **not** be called before ``idf_component_register``:\\n\\n  - commands that are not valid in CMake script mode\\n  - custom commands defined in project_include.cmake\\n  - build system API commands except ``idf_build_get_property``; although consider whether the property may not have been set yet\\n\\nCommands that set and operate on variables are generally okay to call before ``idf_component_register``.\\n\\nThe arguments for ``idf_component_register`` include:\\n\\n  - SRCS - component source files used for creating a static library for the component; if not specified, component is a treated as a config-only component and an interface library is created instead.\\n  - SRC_DIRS, EXCLUDE_SRCS - used to glob source files (.c, .cpp, .S) by specifying directories, instead of specifying source files manually via SRCS. Note that this is subject to the :ref:`limitations of globbing in CMake <cmake-file-globbing>`. Source files specified in EXCLUDE_SRCS are removed from the globbed files.\\n  - INCLUDE_DIRS - paths, relative to the component directory, which will be added to the include search path for all other components which require the current component\\n  - PRIV_INCLUDE_DIRS - directory paths, must be relative to the component directory, which will be added to the include search path for this component\\'s source files only\\n  - REQUIRES - public component requirements for the component\\n  - PRIV_REQUIRES - private component requirements for the component; ignored on config-only components\\n  - LDFRAGMENTS - component linker fragment files\\n  - REQUIRED_IDF_TARGETS - specify the only target the component supports\\n  - KCONFIG - override the default Kconfig file\\n  - KCONFIG_PROJBUILD - override the default Kconfig.projbuild file\\n  - WHOLE_ARCHIVE - if specified, the component library is surrounded by ``-Wl,--whole-archive``, ``-Wl,--no-whole-archive`` when linked. This has the same effect as setting ``WHOLE_ARCHIVE`` component property.\\n\\nThe following are used for :ref:`embedding data into the component <cmake_embed_data>`, and is considered as source files when determining if a component is config-only. This means that even if the component does not specify source files, a static library is still created internally for the component if it specifies either:\\n\\n  - EMBED_FILES - binary files to be embedded in the component\\n  - EMBED_TXTFILES - text files to be embedded in the component\\n\\n\\n.. _cmake-component-properties:\\n\\nIdf-component-properties\\n------------------------\\n\\nThese are properties that describe a component. Values of component properties can be retrieved by using the build command ``idf_component_get_property``. For example, to get the directory of the ``freertos`` component:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n  idf_component_get_property(dir freertos COMPONENT_DIR)\\n  message(STATUS \"The \\'freertos\\' component directory is: ${dir}\")\\n\\n- COMPONENT_ALIAS - alias for COMPONENT_LIB used for linking the component to external targets; set by ``idf_build_component`` and alias library itself is created by ``idf_component_register``\\n- COMPONENT_DIR - component directory; set by ``idf_build_component``\\n- COMPONENT_OVERRIDEN_DIR - contains the directory of the original component if :ref:`this component overrides another component <cmake-components-same-name>`\\n- COMPONENT_LIB - name for created component static/interface library; set by ``idf_build_component`` and library itself is created by ``idf_component_register``\\n- COMPONENT_NAME - name of the component; set by ``idf_build_component`` based on the component directory name\\n- COMPONENT_TYPE - type of the component, whether LIBRARY or CONFIG_ONLY. A component is of type LIBRARY if it specifies source files or embeds a file\\n- EMBED_FILES - list of files to embed in component; set from ``idf_component_register`` EMBED_FILES argument\\n- EMBED_TXTFILES - list of text files to embed in component; set from ``idf_component_register`` EMBED_TXTFILES argument\\n- INCLUDE_DIRS - list of component include directories; set from ``idf_component_register`` INCLUDE_DIRS argument\\n- KCONFIG - component Kconfig file; set by ``idf_build_component``\\n- KCONFIG_PROJBUILD - component Kconfig.projbuild; set by ``idf_build_component``\\n- LDFRAGMENTS - list of component linker fragment files; set from ``idf_component_register`` LDFRAGMENTS argument\\n- MANAGED_PRIV_REQUIRES - list of private component dependencies added by the IDF component manager from dependencies in ``idf_component.yml`` manifest file\\n- MANAGED_REQUIRES - list of public component dependencies added by the IDF component manager from dependencies in ``idf_component.yml`` manifest file\\n- PRIV_INCLUDE_DIRS - list of component private include directories; set from ``idf_component_register`` PRIV_INCLUDE_DIRS on components of type LIBRARY\\n- PRIV_REQUIRES - list of private component dependencies; set from value of ``idf_component_register`` PRIV_REQUIRES argument and dependencies in ``idf_component.yml`` manifest file\\n- REQUIRED_IDF_TARGETS - list of targets the component supports; set from ``idf_component_register`` EMBED_TXTFILES argument\\n- REQUIRES - list of public component dependencies; set from value of ``idf_component_register`` REQUIRES argument and dependencies in ``idf_component.yml`` manifest file\\n- SRCS - list of component source files; set from SRCS or SRC_DIRS/EXCLUDE_SRCS argument of ``idf_component_register``\\n- WHOLE_ARCHIVE - if this property is set to ``TRUE`` (or any boolean \"true\" CMake value: 1, ``ON``, ``YES``, ``Y``), the component library is surrounded by ``-Wl,--whole-archive``, ``-Wl,--no-whole-archive`` when linked. This can be used to force the linker to include every object file into the executable, even if the object file doesn\\'t resolve any references from the rest of the application. This is commonly used when a component contains plugins or modules which rely on link-time registration. This property is ``FALSE`` by default. It can be set to ``TRUE`` from the component CMakeLists.txt file.\\n\\n\\n.. _cmake-file-globbing:\\n\\nFile Globbing & Incremental Builds\\n==================================\\n\\n.. highlight:: cmake\\n\\nThe preferred way to include source files in an ESP-IDF component is to list them manually via SRCS argument to ``idf_component_register``::\\n\\n  idf_component_register(SRCS library/a.c library/b.c platform/platform.c\\n                         ...)\\n\\nThis preference reflects the `CMake best practice <https://gist.github.com/mbinna/c61dbb39bca0e4fb7d1f73b0d66a4fd1/>`_ of manually listing source files. This could, however, be inconvenient when there are lots of source files to add to the build. The ESP-IDF build system provides an alternative way for specifying source files using ``SRC_DIRS``::\\n\\n  idf_component_register(SRC_DIRS library platform\\n                         ...)\\n\\nThis uses globbing behind the scenes to find source files in the specified directories. Be aware, however, that if a new source file is added and this method is used, then CMake won\\'t know to automatically re-run and this file won\\'t be added to the build.\\n\\nThe trade-off is acceptable when you\\'re adding the file yourself, because you can trigger a clean build or run ``idf.py reconfigure`` to manually re-run CMake_. However, the problem gets harder when you share your project with others who may check out a new version using a source control tool like Git...\\n\\nFor components which are part of ESP-IDF, we use a third party Git CMake integration module (:idf_file:`/tools/cmake/third_party/GetGitRevisionDescription.cmake`) which automatically re-runs CMake any time the repository commit changes. This means if you check out a new ESP-IDF version, CMake will automatically rerun.\\n\\nFor project components (not part of ESP-IDF), there are a few different options:\\n\\n- If keeping your project file in Git, ESP-IDF will automatically track the Git revision and re-run CMake if the revision changes.\\n- If some components are kept in a third git repository (not the project repository or ESP-IDF repository), you can add a call to the ``git_describe`` function in a component CMakeLists file in order to automatically trigger re-runs of CMake when the Git revision changes.\\n- If not using Git, remember to manually run ``idf.py reconfigure`` whenever a source file may change.\\n- To avoid this problem entirely, use ``SRCS`` argument to ``idf_component_register`` to list all source files in project components.\\n\\nThe best option will depend on your particular project and its users.\\n\\n\\n.. _build_system_metadata:\\n\\nBuild System Metadata\\n=====================\\n\\nFor integration into IDEs and other build systems, when CMake runs the build process generates a number of metadata files in the ``build/`` directory. To regenerate these files, run ``cmake`` or ``idf.py reconfigure`` (or any other ``idf.py`` build command).\\n\\n- ``compile_commands.json`` is a standard format JSON file which describes every source file which is compiled in the project. A CMake feature generates this file, and many IDEs know how to parse it.\\n- ``project_description.json`` contains some general information about the ESP-IDF project, configured paths, etc.\\n- ``flasher_args.json`` contains esptool.py arguments to flash the project\\'s binary files. There are also ``flash_*_args`` files which can be used directly with esptool.py. See `Flash arguments`_.\\n- ``CMakeCache.txt`` is the CMake cache file which contains other information about the CMake process, toolchain, etc.\\n- ``config/sdkconfig.json`` is a JSON-formatted version of the project configuration values.\\n- ``config/kconfig_menus.json`` is a JSON-formatted version of the menus shown in menuconfig, for use in external IDE UIs.\\n\\n\\nJSON Configuration Server\\n-------------------------\\n\\nA tool called ``kconfserver`` is provided to allow IDEs to easily integrate with the configuration system logic. ``kconfserver`` is designed to run in the background and interact with a calling process by reading and writing JSON over process stdin & stdout.\\n\\nYou can run ``kconfserver`` from a project via ``idf.py confserver`` or ``ninja kconfserver``, or a similar target triggered from a different build generator.\\n\\nFor more information about ``kconfserver``, see the `esp-idf-kconfig documentation <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf-kconfig/blob/master/docs/DOCUMENTATION.md>`_.\\n\\n\\nBuild System Internals\\n======================\\n\\nBuild Scripts\\n-------------\\n\\nThe listfiles for the ESP-IDF build system reside in :idf:`/tools/cmake`. The modules which implement core build system functionality are as follows:\\n\\n    - build.cmake - Build related commands i.e., build initialization, retrieving/setting build properties, build processing.\\n    - component.cmake - Component related commands i.e., adding components, retrieving/setting component properties, registering components.\\n    - kconfig.cmake - Generation of configuration files (sdkconfig, sdkconfig.h, sdkconfig.cmake, etc.) from Kconfig files.\\n    - ldgen.cmake - Generation  of  final linker script from linker fragment files.\\n    - target.cmake - Setting build target and toolchain file.\\n    - utilities.cmake - Miscellaneous helper commands.\\n\\n Aside from these files, there are two other important CMake scripts in :idf:`/tools/cmake`:\\n\\n    - idf.cmake - Sets up the build and includes the core modules listed above. Included in CMake projects in order to access ESP-IDF build system functionality.\\n    - project.cmake - Includes ``idf.cmake`` and provides a custom ``project()`` command that takes care of all the heavy lifting of building an executable. Included in the top-level CMakeLists.txt of standard ESP-IDF projects.\\n\\nThe rest of the files in :idf:`/tools/cmake` are support or third-party scripts used in the build process.\\n\\n\\nBuild Process\\n-------------\\n\\nThis section describes the standard ESP-IDF application build process. The build process can be broken down roughly into four phases:\\n\\n.. blockdiag::\\n    :scale: 100%\\n    :caption: ESP-IDF Build System Process\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    blockdiag idf-build-system-process {\\n        Initialization -> Enumeration\\n        Enumeration -> Processing\\n        Processing -> Finalization\\n    }\\n\\n\\nInitialization\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThis phase sets up necessary parameters for the build.\\n\\n    - Upon inclusion of ``idf.cmake`` in ``project.cmake``, the following steps are performed:\\n        - Set ``IDF_PATH`` from environment variable or inferred from path to ``project.cmake`` included in the top-level CMakeLists.txt.\\n        - Add :idf:`/tools/cmake` to ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`` and include core modules plus the various helper/third-party scripts.\\n        - Set build tools/executables such as default Python interpreter.\\n        - Get ESP-IDF git revision and store as ``IDF_VER``.\\n        - Set global build specifications i.e., compile options, compile definitions, include directories for all components in the build.\\n        - Add components in :idf:`components` to the build.\\n    - The initial part of the custom ``project()`` command performs the following steps:\\n        - Set ``IDF_TARGET`` from environment variable or CMake cache and the corresponding ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`` to be used.\\n        - Add components in ``EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS`` to the build.\\n        - Prepare arguments for calling command ``idf_build_process()`` from variables such as ``COMPONENTS``/``EXCLUDE_COMPONENTS``, ``SDKCONFIG``, ``SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS``.\\n\\n  The call to ``idf_build_process()`` command marks the end of this phase.\\n\\n\\nEnumeration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n  This phase builds a final list of components to be processed in the build, and is performed in the first half of ``idf_build_process()``.\\n\\n    - Retrieve each component\\'s public and private requirements. A child process is created which executes each component\\'s CMakeLists.txt in script mode. The values of ``idf_component_register`` REQUIRES and PRIV_REQUIRES argument is returned to the parent build process. This is called early expansion. The variable ``CMAKE_BUILD_EARLY_EXPANSION`` is defined during this step.\\n    - Recursively include components based on public and private requirements.\\n\\n\\nProcessing\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n  This phase processes the components in the build, and is the second half of ``idf_build_process()``.\\n\\n  - Load project configuration from sdkconfig file and generate an sdkconfig.cmake and sdkconfig.h header. These define configuration variables/macros that are accessible from the build scripts and C/C++ source/header files, respectively.\\n  - Include each component\\'s ``project_include.cmake``.\\n  - Add each component as a subdirectory, processing its CMakeLists.txt. The component CMakeLists.txt calls the registration command, ``idf_component_register`` which adds source files, include directories, creates component library, links dependencies, etc.\\n\\n\\nFinalization\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n  This phase is everything after ``idf_build_process()``.\\n\\n  - Create executable and link the component libraries to it.\\n  - Generate project metadata files such as project_description.json and display relevant information about the project built.\\n\\nBrowse :idf_file:`/tools/cmake/project.cmake` for more details.\\n\\n\\n.. _migrating_from_make:\\n\\nMigrating from ESP-IDF GNU Make System\\n======================================\\n\\nSome aspects of the CMake-based ESP-IDF build system are very similar to the older GNU Make-based system. The developer needs to provide values the include directories, source files etc. There is a syntactical difference, however, as the developer needs to pass these as arguments to the registration command, ``idf_component_register``.\\n\\n\\nAutomatic Conversion Tool\\n-------------------------\\n\\nAn automatic project conversion tool is available in `tools/cmake/convert_to_cmake.py` in ESP-IDF v4.x releases. The script was removed in v5.0 because of its `make` build system dependency.\\n\\n\\nNo Longer Available in CMake\\n----------------------------\\n\\nSome features are significantly different or removed in the CMake-based system. The following variables no longer exist in the CMake-based build system:\\n\\n- ``COMPONENT_BUILD_DIR``: Use ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`` instead.\\n- ``COMPONENT_LIBRARY``: Defaulted to ``$(COMPONENT_NAME).a``, but the library name could be overriden by the component. The name of the component library can no longer be overriden by the component.\\n- ``CC``, ``LD``, ``AR``, ``OBJCOPY``: Full paths to each tool from the gcc xtensa cross-toolchain. Use ``CMAKE_C_COMPILER``, ``CMAKE_C_LINK_EXECUTABLE``, ``CMAKE_OBJCOPY``, etc instead. `Full list here <cmake language variables_>`_.\\n- ``HOSTCC``, ``HOSTLD``, ``HOSTAR``: Full names of each tool from the host native toolchain. These are no longer provided, external projects should detect any required host toolchain manually.\\n- ``COMPONENT_ADD_LDFLAGS``: Used to override linker flags. Use the CMake `target_link_libraries`_ command instead.\\n- ``COMPONENT_ADD_LINKER_DEPS``: List of files that linking should depend on. `target_link_libraries`_ will usually infer these dependencies automatically. For linker scripts, use the provided custom CMake function ``target_linker_scripts``.\\n- ``COMPONENT_SUBMODULES``: No longer used, the build system will automatically enumerate all submodules in the ESP-IDF repository.\\n- ``COMPONENT_EXTRA_INCLUDES``: Used to be an alternative to ``COMPONENT_PRIV_INCLUDEDIRS`` for absolute paths. Use ``PRIV_INCLUDE_DIRS`` argument to ``idf_component_register`` for all cases now (can be relative or absolute).\\n- ``COMPONENT_OBJS``: Previously, component sources could be specified as a list of object files. Now they can be specified as a list of source files via ``SRCS`` argument to `idf_component_register`.\\n- ``COMPONENT_OBJEXCLUDE``: Has been replaced with ``EXCLUDE_SRCS`` argument to ``idf_component_register``. Specify source files (as absolute paths or relative to component directory), instead.\\n- ``COMPONENT_EXTRA_CLEAN``: Set property ``ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES`` instead but note :ref:`CMake has some restrictions around this functionality <ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES_note>`.\\n- ``COMPONENT_OWNBUILDTARGET`` & ``COMPONENT_OWNCLEANTARGET``: Use CMake `ExternalProject`_ instead. See :ref:`component-build-full-override` for full details.\\n- ``COMPONENT_CONFIG_ONLY``: Call ``idf_component_register`` without any arguments instead. See `Configuration-Only Components`_.\\n- ``CFLAGS``, ``CPPFLAGS``, ``CXXFLAGS``: Use equivalent CMake commands instead. See `Controlling Component Compilation`_.\\n\\n\\nNo Default Values\\n-----------------\\n\\nUnlike in the legacy Make-based build system, the following have no default values:\\n\\n- Source directories (``COMPONENT_SRCDIRS`` variable in Make, ``SRC_DIRS`` argument to ``idf_component_register`` in CMake)\\n- Include directories (``COMPONENT_ADD_INCLUDEDIRS`` variable in Make, ``INCLUDE_DIRS`` argument to ``idf_component_register`` in CMake)\\n\\n\\nNo Longer Necessary\\n-------------------\\n\\n- In the legacy Make-based build system, it is required to also set ``COMPONENT_SRCDIRS`` if ``COMPONENT_SRCS`` is set. In CMake, the equivalent is not necessary i.e., specifying ``SRC_DIRS`` to ``idf_component_register`` if ``SRCS`` is also specified (in fact, ``SRCS`` is ignored if ``SRC_DIRS`` is specified).\\n\\n\\nFlashing from Make\\n------------------\\n\\n``make flash`` and similar targets still work to build and flash. However, project ``sdkconfig`` no longer specifies serial port and baud rate. Environment variables can be used to override these. See :ref:`flash-with-ninja-or-make` for more details.\\n\\n.. _esp-idf-template: https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf-template\\n.. _cmake: https://cmake.org\\n.. _ninja: https://ninja-build.org\\n.. _esptool.py: https://github.com/espressif/esptool/#readme\\n.. _CMake v3.16 documentation: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/index.html\\n.. _cmake command line documentation: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/manual/cmake.1.html#options\\n.. _cmake add_library: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/command/add_library.html\\n.. _cmake if: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/command/if.html\\n.. _cmake list: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/command/list.html\\n.. _cmake project: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/command/project.html\\n.. _cmake set: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/command/set.html\\n.. _cmake string: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/command/string.html\\n.. _cmake faq generated files: https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/-/wikis/FAQ#how-can-i-generate-a-source-file-during-the-build\\n.. _ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/prop_dir/ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES.html\\n.. _ExternalProject: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/module/ExternalProject.html\\n.. _cmake language variables: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/manual/cmake-variables.7.html#variables-for-languages\\n.. _set_source_files_properties: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/command/set_source_files_properties.html\\n.. _target_compile_options: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/command/target_compile_options.html\\n.. _target_link_libraries: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/command/target_link_libraries.html#command:target_link_libraries\\n.. _cmake_toolchain_file: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/variable/CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE.html\\n.. _LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.16/prop_tgt/LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY.html\\n.. _quirc: https://github.com/dlbeer/quirc\\n.. _pyenv: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#readme\\n.. _virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/\\n',\n",

It is not a MUST, but it is strongly recommended that you take some time to read this article first, especially if you want to program a robust Wi-Fi application.\\n\\nThis article is supplementary to the Wi-Fi APIs/Examples. It describes the principles of using the Wi-Fi APIs, the limitations of the current Wi-Fi API implementation, and the most common pitfalls in using Wi-Fi. This article also reveals some design details of the Wi-Fi driver. We recommend you to select an :example:`example <wifi>`.\\n\\nSetting Wi-Fi Compile-time Options\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nRefer to `Wi-Fi Menuconfig`_.\\n\\nInit Wi-Fi\\n+++++++++++\\n\\nRefer to `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi station General Scenario`_ and `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi AP General Scenario`_.\\n\\nStart/Connect Wi-Fi\\n++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nRefer to `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi station General Scenario`_ and `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi AP General Scenario`_.\\n\\nEvent-Handling\\n++++++++++++++\\n\\nGenerally, it is easy to write code in \"sunny-day\" scenarios, such as `WIFI_EVENT_STA_START`_ and `WIFI_EVENT_STA_CONNECTED`_. The hard part is to write routines in \"rainy-day\" scenarios, such as `WIFI_EVENT_STA_DISCONNECTED`_. Good handling of \"rainy-day\" scenarios is fundamental to robust Wi-Fi applications. Refer to `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi Event Description`_, `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi station General Scenario`_, and `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi AP General Scenario`_. See also the :doc:`overview of the Event Loop Library in ESP-IDF <../api-reference/system/esp_event>`.\\n\\nWrite Error-Recovery Routines Correctly at All Times\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nJust like the handling of \"rainy-day\" scenarios, a good error-recovery routine is also fundamental to robust Wi-Fi applications. Refer to `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi API Error Code`_.\\n\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi API Error Code\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nAll of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi APIs have well-defined return values, namely, the error code. The error code can be categorized into:\\n\\n - No errors, e.g., :c:macro:`ESP_OK` means that the API returns successfully.\\n - Recoverable errors, such as :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NO_MEM`.\\n - Non-recoverable, non-critical errors.\\n - Non-recoverable, critical errors.\\n\\nWhether the error is critical or not depends on the API and the application scenario, and it is defined by the API user.\\n\\n**The primary principle to write a robust application with Wi-Fi API is to always check the error code and write the error-handling code.** Generally, the error-handling code can be used:\\n\\n - For recoverable errors, in which case you can write a recoverable-error code. For example, when :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_start()` returns :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NO_MEM`, the recoverable-error code vTaskDelay can be called in order to get a microseconds\\' delay for another try.\\n - For non-recoverable, yet non-critical errors, in which case printing the error code is a good method for error handling.\\n - For non-recoverable and also critical errors, in which case \"assert\" may be a good method for error handling. For example, if :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_mode()` returns ``ESP_ERR_WIFI_NOT_INIT``, it means that the Wi-Fi driver is not initialized by :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_init()` successfully. You can detect this kind of error very quickly in the application development phase.\\n\\nIn :component_file:`esp_common/include/esp_err.h`, ``ESP_ERROR_CHECK`` checks the return values. It is a rather commonplace error-handling code and can be used as the default error-handling code in the application development phase. However, it is strongly recommended that API users write their own error-handling code.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi API Parameter Initialization\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWhen initializing struct parameters for the API, one of two approaches should be followed:\\n\\n- Explicitly set all fields of the parameter.\\n- Use get API to get current configuration first, then set application specific fields.\\n\\nInitializing or getting the entire structure is very important, because most of the time the value 0 indicates that the default value is used. More fields may be added to the struct in the future and initializing these to zero ensures the application will still work correctly after ESP-IDF is updated to a new release.\\n\\n.. _wifi-programming-model:\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi Programming Model\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nThe {IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi programming model is depicted as follows:\\n\\n.. blockdiag::\\n    :caption: Wi-Fi Programming Model\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    blockdiag wifi-programming-model {\\n\\n        # global attributes\\n        node_height = 60;\\n        node_width = 100;\\n        span_width = 100;\\n        span_height = 60;\\n        default_shape = roundedbox;\\n        default_group_color = none;\\n\\n        # node labels\\n        TCP_STACK [label=\"TCP\\\\n stack\", fontsize=12];\\n        EVNT_TASK [label=\"Event\\\\n task\", fontsize=12];\\n        APPL_TASK [label=\"Application\\\\n task\", width = 120, fontsize=12];\\n        WIFI_DRV  [label=\"Wi-Fi\\\\n Driver\", width = 120, fontsize=12];\\n        KNOT [shape=none];\\n\\n        # node connections + labels\\n        TCP_STACK -> EVNT_TASK [label=event];\\n        EVNT_TASK -> APPL_TASK [label=\"callback\\\\n or event\"];\\n\\n        # arrange nodes vertically\\n        group {\\n           label = \"default handler\";\\n           orientation = portrait;\\n           EVNT_TASK <- WIFI_DRV [label=event];\\n        }\\n\\n        # intermediate node\\n        group {\\n            label = \"user handler\";\\n            orientation = portrait;\\n            APPL_TASK -- KNOT;\\n        }\\n        WIFI_DRV <- KNOT [label=\"API\\\\n call\"];\\n    }\\n\\n\\nThe Wi-Fi driver can be considered a black box that knows nothing about high-layer code, such as the TCP/IP stack, application task, and event task. The application task (code) generally calls :doc:`Wi-Fi driver APIs <../api-reference/network/esp_wifi>` to initialize Wi-Fi and handles Wi-Fi events when necessary. Wi-Fi driver receives API calls, handles them, and posts events to the application.\\n\\nWi-Fi event handling is based on the :doc:`esp_event library <../api-reference/system/esp_event>`. Events are sent by the Wi-Fi driver to the :ref:`default event loop <esp-event-default-loops>`. Application may handle these events in callbacks registered using :cpp:func:`esp_event_handler_register()`. Wi-Fi events are also handled by :doc:`esp_netif component <../api-reference/network/esp_netif>` to provide a set of default behaviors. For example, when Wi-Fi station connects to an AP, esp_netif will automatically start the DHCP client by default.\\n\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi Event Description\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nWIFI_EVENT_WIFI_READY\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nThe Wi-Fi driver will never generate this event, which, as a result, can be ignored by the application event callback. This event may be removed in future releases.\\n\\nWIFI_EVENT_SCAN_DONE\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nThe scan-done event is triggered by :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_start()` and will arise in the following scenarios:\\n\\n  - The scan is completed, e.g., the target AP is found successfully, or all channels have been scanned.\\n  - The scan is stopped by :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_stop()`.\\n  - The :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_start()` is called before the scan is completed. A new scan will override the current scan and a scan-done event will be generated.\\n\\nThe scan-done event will not arise in the following scenarios:\\n\\n  - It is a blocked scan.\\n  - The scan is caused by :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_connect()`.\\n\\nUpon receiving this event, the event task does nothing. The application event callback needs to call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_get_ap_num()` and :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_get_ap_records()` to fetch the scanned AP list and trigger the Wi-Fi driver to free the internal memory which is allocated during the scan **(do not forget to do this!)**.\\nRefer to `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi Scan`_ for a more detailed description.\\n\\nWIFI_EVENT_STA_START\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nIf :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_start()` returns :c:macro:`ESP_OK` and the current Wi-Fi mode is station or station/AP, then this event will arise. Upon receiving this event, the event task will initialize the LwIP network interface (netif). Generally, the application event callback needs to call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_connect()` to connect to the configured AP.\\n\\nWIFI_EVENT_STA_STOP\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nIf :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_stop()` returns :c:macro:`ESP_OK` and the current Wi-Fi mode is station or station/AP, then this event will arise. Upon receiving this event, the event task will release the station\\'s IP address, stop the DHCP client, remove TCP/UDP-related connections, and clear the LwIP station netif, etc. The application event callback generally does not need to do anything.\\n\\nWIFI_EVENT_STA_CONNECTED\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nIf :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_connect()` returns :c:macro:`ESP_OK` and the station successfully connects to the target AP, the connection event will arise. Upon receiving this event, the event task starts the DHCP client and begins the DHCP process of getting the IP address. Then, the Wi-Fi driver is ready for sending and receiving data. This moment is good for beginning the application work, provided that the application does not depend on LwIP, namely the IP address. However, if the application is LwIP-based, then you need to wait until the *got ip* event comes in.\\n\\nWIFI_EVENT_STA_DISCONNECTED\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nThis event can be generated in the following scenarios:\\n\\n  - When :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_disconnect()` or :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_stop()` is called and the station is already connected to the AP.\\n  - When :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_connect()` is called, but the Wi-Fi driver fails to set up a connection with the AP due to certain reasons, e.g., the scan fails to find the target AP or the authentication times out. If there are more than one AP with the same SSID, the disconnected event will be raised after the station fails to connect all of the found APs.\\n  - When the Wi-Fi connection is disrupted because of specific reasons, e.g., the station continuously loses N beacons, the AP kicks off the station, or the AP\\'s authentication mode is changed.\\n\\nUpon receiving this event, the default behaviors of the event task are:\\n\\n- Shutting down the station\\'s LwIP netif.\\n- Notifying the LwIP task to clear the UDP/TCP connections which cause the wrong status to all sockets. For socket-based applications, the application callback can choose to close all sockets and re-create them, if necessary, upon receiving this event.\\n\\nThe most common event handle code for this event in application is to call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_connect()` to reconnect the Wi-Fi. However, if the event is raised because :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_disconnect()` is called, the application should not call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_connect()` to reconnect. It is the application\\'s responsibility to distinguish whether the event is caused by :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_disconnect()` or other reasons. Sometimes a better reconnection strategy is required. Refer to `Wi-Fi Reconnect`_ and `Scan When Wi-Fi Is Connecting`_.\\n\\nAnother thing that deserves attention is that the default behavior of LwIP is to abort all TCP socket connections on receiving the disconnect. In most cases, it is not a problem. However, for some special applications, this may not be what they want. Consider the following scenarios:\\n\\n- The application creates a TCP connection to maintain the application-level keep-alive data that is sent out every 60 seconds.\\n- Due to certain reasons, the Wi-Fi connection is cut off, and the `WIFI_EVENT_STA_DISCONNECTED`_ is raised. According to the current implementation, all TCP connections will be removed and the keep-alive socket will be in a wrong status. However, since the application designer believes that the network layer should **ignore** this error at the Wi-Fi layer, the application does not close the socket.\\n- Five seconds later, the Wi-Fi connection is restored because :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_connect()` is called in the application event callback function. **Moreover, the station connects to the same AP and gets the same IPV4 address as before**.\\n- Sixty seconds later, when the application sends out data with the keep-alive socket, the socket returns an error and the application closes the socket and re-creates it when necessary.\\n\\nIn above scenarios, ideally, the application sockets and the network layer should not be affected, since the Wi-Fi connection only fails temporarily and recovers very quickly. The application can enable \"Keep TCP connections when IP changed\" via LwIP menuconfig.\\n\\nIP_EVENT_STA_GOT_IP\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nThis event arises when the DHCP client successfully gets the IPV4 address from the DHCP server, or when the IPV4 address is changed. The event means that everything is ready and the application can begin its tasks (e.g., creating sockets).\\n\\nThe IPV4 may be changed because of the following reasons:\\n\\n  - The DHCP client fails to renew/rebind the IPV4 address, and the station\\'s IPV4 is reset to 0.\\n  - The DHCP client rebinds to a different address.\\n  - The static-configured IPV4 address is changed.\\n\\nWhether the IPV4 address is changed or not is indicated by the field ``ip_change`` of ``ip_event_got_ip_t``.\\n\\nThe socket is based on the IPV4 address, which means that, if the IPV4 changes, all sockets relating to this IPV4 will become abnormal. Upon receiving this event, the application needs to close all sockets and recreate the application when the IPV4 changes to a valid one.\\n\\nIP_EVENT_GOT_IP6\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nThis event arises when the IPV6 SLAAC support auto-configures an address for the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, or when this address changes. The event means that everything is ready and the application can begin its tasks, e.g., creating sockets.\\n\\nIP_EVENT_STA_LOST_IP\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nThis event arises when the IPV4 address becomes invalid.\\n\\nIP_EVENT_STA_LOST_IP does not arise immediately after the Wi-Fi disconnects. Instead, it starts an IPV4 address lost timer. If the IPV4 address is got before ip lost timer expires, IP_EVENT_STA_LOST_IP does not happen. Otherwise, the event arises when the IPV4 address lost timer expires.\\n\\nGenerally, the application can ignore this event, because it is just a debug event to inform that the IPV4 address is lost.\\n\\nWIFI_EVENT_AP_START\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nSimilar to `WIFI_EVENT_STA_START`_.\\n\\nWIFI_EVENT_AP_STOP\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nSimilar to `WIFI_EVENT_STA_STOP`_.\\n\\nWIFI_EVENT_AP_STACONNECTED\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nEvery time a station is connected to {IDF_TARGET_NAME} AP, the `WIFI_EVENT_AP_STACONNECTED`_ will arise. Upon receiving this event, the event task will do nothing, and the application callback can also ignore it. However, you may want to do something, for example, to get the info of the connected STA.\\n\\nWIFI_EVENT_AP_STADISCONNECTED\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nThis event can happen in the following scenarios:\\n\\n  - The application calls :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_disconnect()`, or :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_deauth_sta()`, to manually disconnect the station.\\n  - The Wi-Fi driver kicks off the station, e.g., because the AP has not received any packets in the past five minutes. The time can be modified by :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_inactive_time()`.\\n  - The station kicks off the AP.\\n\\nWhen this event happens, the event task will do nothing, but the application event callback needs to do something, e.g., close the socket which is related to this station.\\n\\nWIFI_EVENT_AP_PROBEREQRECVED\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nThis event is disabled by default. The application can enable it via API :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_event_mask()`.\\nWhen this event is enabled, it will be raised each time the AP receives a probe request.\\n\\nWIFI_EVENT_STA_BEACON_TIMEOUT\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nIf the station does not receive the beacon of the connected AP within the inactive time, the beacon timeout happens, the `WIFI_EVENT_STA_BEACON_TIMEOUT`_ will arise. The application can set inactive time via API :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_inactive_time()`.\\n\\nWIFI_EVENT_CONNECTIONLESS_MODULE_WAKE_INTERVAL_START\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nThe `WIFI_EVENT_CONNECTIONLESS_MODULE_WAKE_INTERVAL_START`_ will arise at the start of connectionless module `Interval`. See :ref:`connectionless module power save <connectionless-module-power-save>`.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi Station General Scenario\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBelow is a \"big scenario\" which describes some small scenarios in station mode:\\n\\n.. seqdiag::\\n    :caption: Sample Wi-Fi Event Scenarios in Station Mode\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    seqdiag sample-scenarios-station-mode {\\n        activation = none;\\n        node_width = 80;\\n        node_height = 60;\\n        edge_length = 140;\\n        span_height = 5;\\n        default_shape = roundedbox;\\n        default_fontsize = 12;\\n\\n        MAIN_TASK  [label = \"Main\\\\ntask\"];\\n        APP_TASK   [label = \"App\\\\ntask\"];\\n        EVENT_TASK [label = \"Event\\\\ntask\"];\\n        LwIP_TASK  [label = \"LwIP\\\\ntask\"];\\n        WIFI_TASK  [label = \"Wi-Fi\\\\ntask\"];\\n\\n        === 1.

Wi-Fi/LwIP Init Phase\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n - s1.1: The main task calls :cpp:func:`esp_netif_init()` to create an LwIP core task and initialize LwIP-related work.\\n\\n - s1.2: The main task calls :cpp:func:`esp_event_loop_create()` to create a system Event task and initialize an application event\\'s callback function. In the scenario above, the application event\\'s callback function does nothing but relaying the event to the application task.\\n\\n - s1.3: The main task calls :cpp:func:`esp_netif_create_default_wifi_ap()` or :cpp:func:`esp_netif_create_default_wifi_sta()` to create default network interface instance binding station or AP with TCP/IP stack.\\n\\n - s1.4: The main task calls :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_init()` to create the Wi-Fi driver task and initialize the Wi-Fi driver.\\n\\n - s1.5: The main task calls OS API to create the application task.\\n\\nStep 1.1 ~ 1.5 is a recommended sequence that initializes a Wi-Fi-/LwIP-based application. However, it is **NOT** a must-follow sequence, which means that you can create the application task in step 1.1 and put all other initialization in the application task. Moreover, you may not want to create the application task in the initialization phase if the application task depends on the sockets. Rather, you can defer the task creation until the IP is obtained.\\n\\n2. Wi-Fi Configuration Phase\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nOnce the Wi-Fi driver is initialized, you can start configuring the Wi-Fi driver. In this scenario, the mode is station, so you may need to call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_mode` (WIFI_MODE_STA) to configure the Wi-Fi mode as station. You can call other `esp_wifi_set_xxx` APIs to configure more settings, such as the protocol mode, the country code, and the bandwidth. Refer to `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi Configuration`_.\\n\\nGenerally, the Wi-Fi driver should be configured before the Wi-Fi connection is set up. But this is **NOT** mandatory, which means that you can configure the Wi-Fi connection anytime, provided that the Wi-Fi driver is initialized successfully. However, if the configuration does not need to change after the Wi-Fi connection is set up, you should configure the Wi-Fi driver at this stage, because the configuration APIs (such as :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_protocol()`) will cause the Wi-Fi to reconnect, which may not be desirable.\\n\\nIf the Wi-Fi NVS flash is enabled by menuconfig, all Wi-Fi configuration in this phase, or later phases, will be stored into flash. When the board powers on/reboots, you do not need to configure the Wi-Fi driver from scratch. You only need to call ``esp_wifi_get_xxx`` APIs to fetch the configuration stored in flash previously. You can also configure the Wi-Fi driver if the previous configuration is not what you want.\\n\\n3. Wi-Fi Start Phase\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n - s3.1: Call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_start()` to start the Wi-Fi driver.\\n - s3.2: The Wi-Fi driver posts `WIFI_EVENT_STA_START`_ to the event task; then, the event task will do some common things and will call the application event callback function.\\n - s3.3: The application event callback function relays the `WIFI_EVENT_STA_START`_ to the application task. We recommend that you call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_connect()`. However, you can also call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_connect()` in other phrases after the `WIFI_EVENT_STA_START`_ arises.\\n\\n4. Wi-Fi Connect Phase\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n - s4.1: Once :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_connect()` is called, the Wi-Fi driver will start the internal scan/connection process.\\n\\n - s4.2: If the internal scan/connection process is successful, the `WIFI_EVENT_STA_CONNECTED`_ will be generated. In the event task, it starts the DHCP client, which will finally trigger the DHCP process.\\n\\n - s4.3: In the above-mentioned scenario, the application event callback will relay the event to the application task. Generally, the application needs to do nothing, and you can do whatever you want, e.g., print a log.\\n\\nIn step 4.2, the Wi-Fi connection may fail because, for example, the password is wrong, or the AP is not found. In a case like this, `WIFI_EVENT_STA_DISCONNECTED`_ will arise and the reason for such a failure will be provided. For handling events that disrupt Wi-Fi connection, please refer to phase 6.\\n\\n5. Wi-Fi \\'Got IP\\' Phase\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n - s5.1: Once the DHCP client is initialized in step 4.2, the *got IP* phase will begin.\\n - s5.2: If the IP address is successfully received from the DHCP server, then `IP_EVENT_STA_GOT_IP`_ will arise and the event task will perform common handling.\\n - s5.3: In the application event callback, `IP_EVENT_STA_GOT_IP`_ is relayed to the application task. For LwIP-based applications, this event is very special and means that everything is ready for the application to begin its tasks, e.g., creating the TCP/UDP socket. A very common mistake is to initialize the socket before `IP_EVENT_STA_GOT_IP`_ is received. **DO NOT start the socket-related work before the IP is received.**\\n\\n6. Wi-Fi Disconnect Phase\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n - s6.1: When the Wi-Fi connection is disrupted, e.g., the AP is powered off or the RSSI is poor, `WIFI_EVENT_STA_DISCONNECTED`_ will arise. This event may also arise in phase 3. Here, the event task will notify the LwIP task to clear/remove all UDP/TCP connections. Then, all application sockets will be in a wrong status. In other words, no socket can work properly when this event happens.\\n - s6.2: In the scenario described above, the application event callback function relays `WIFI_EVENT_STA_DISCONNECTED`_ to the application task. The recommended actions are: 1) call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_connect()` to reconnect the Wi-Fi, 2) close all sockets, and 3) re-create them if necessary. For details, please refer to `WIFI_EVENT_STA_DISCONNECTED`_.\\n\\n7. Wi-Fi IP Change Phase\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n - s7.1: If the IP address is changed, the `IP_EVENT_STA_GOT_IP`_ will arise with \"ip_change\" set to true.\\n - s7.2: **This event is important to the application. When it occurs, the timing is good for closing all created sockets and recreating them.**\\n\\n\\n8. Wi-Fi Deinit Phase\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n - s8.1: Call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_disconnect()` to disconnect the Wi-Fi connectivity.\\n - s8.2: Call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_stop()` to stop the Wi-Fi driver.\\n - s8.3: Call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_deinit()` to unload the Wi-Fi driver.\\n\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi AP General Scenario\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nBelow is a \"big scenario\" which describes some small scenarios in AP mode:\\n\\n .. seqdiag::\\n    :caption: Sample Wi-Fi Event Scenarios in AP Mode\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    seqdiag sample-scenarios-soft-ap-mode {\\n        activation = none;\\n        node_width = 80;\\n        node_height = 60;\\n        edge_length = 140;\\n        span_height = 5;\\n        default_shape = roundedbox;\\n        default_fontsize = 12;\\n\\n        MAIN_TASK  [label = \"Main\\\\ntask\"];\\n        APP_TASK   [label = \"App\\\\ntask\"];\\n        EVENT_TASK [label = \"Event\\\\ntask\"];\\n        LwIP_TASK  [label = \"LwIP\\\\ntask\"];\\n        WIFI_TASK  [label = \"Wi-Fi\\\\ntask\"];\\n\\n        === 1.

Foreground or background scanning is controlled by the Wi-Fi driver and cannot be configured by the application.\\n   * - Background Scan\\n     - This scan is applicable when there is a Wi-Fi connection in station mode or in station/AP mode. Whether it is a foreground scan or background scan depends on the Wi-Fi driver and cannot be configured by the application.\\n   * - All-Channel Scan\\n     - It scans all of the channels.

The foreground scan can only occur in station mode where the station does not connect to any AP. Whether it is a foreground or background scan is totally determined by the Wi-Fi driver, and cannot be configured by the application.\\n\\nDetailed scenario description:\\n\\nScan Configuration Phase\\n**************************\\n\\n - s1.1: Call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_country()` to set the country info if the default country info is not what you want. Refer to `Wi-Fi Country Code`_.\\n - s1.2: Call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_start()` to configure the scan. To do so, you can refer to `Scan Configuration`_. Since this is an all-channel scan, just set the SSID/BSSID/channel to 0.\\n\\n\\nWi-Fi Driver\\'s Internal Scan Phase\\n**************************************\\n\\n - s2.1: The Wi-Fi driver switches to channel 1. In this case, the scan type is WIFI_SCAN_TYPE_ACTIVE, and a probe request is broadcasted. Otherwise, the Wi-Fi will wait for a beacon from the APs. The Wi-Fi driver will stay in channel 1 for some time. The dwell time is configured in min/max time, with the default value being 120 ms.\\n - s2.2: The Wi-Fi driver switches to channel 2 and performs the same operation as in step 2.1.\\n - s2.3: The Wi-Fi driver scans the last channel N, where N is determined by the country code which is configured in step 1.1.\\n\\nScan-Done Event Handling Phase\\n*********************************\\n\\n - s3.1: When all channels are scanned, `WIFI_EVENT_SCAN_DONE`_ will arise.\\n - s3.2: The application\\'s event callback function notifies the application task that `WIFI_EVENT_SCAN_DONE`_ is received. :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_get_ap_num()` is called to get the number of APs that have been found in this scan. Then, it allocates enough entries and calls :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_get_ap_records()` to get the AP records. Please note that the AP records in the Wi-Fi driver will be freed once :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_get_ap_records()` is called. Do not call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_get_ap_records()` twice for a single scan-done event. If :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_get_ap_records()` is not called when the scan-done event occurs, the AP records allocated by the Wi-Fi driver will not be freed. So, make sure you call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_get_ap_records()`, yet only once.\\n\\nScan All APs on All Channels (Background)\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nScenario:\\n\\n.. seqdiag::\\n    :caption: Background Scan of all Wi-Fi Channels\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    seqdiag background-scan-all-channels {\\n        activation = none;\\n        node_width = 80;\\n        node_height = 60;\\n        edge_length = 160;\\n        span_height = 5;\\n        default_shape = roundedbox;\\n        default_fontsize = 12;\\n\\n        APP_TASK   [label = \"App\\\\ntask\"];\\n        EVENT_TASK [label = \"Event\\\\ntask\"];\\n        WIFI_TASK  [label = \"Wi-Fi\\\\ntask\"];\\n\\n        APP_TASK   ->  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"1.1 > Configure country code\"];\\n        APP_TASK   ->  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"1.2 > Scan configuration\"];\\n        WIFI_TASK  ->  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"2.1 > Scan channel 1\"];\\n        WIFI_TASK  ->  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"2.2 > Back to home channel H\"];\\n        WIFI_TASK  ->  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"2.3 > Scan channel 2\"];\\n        WIFI_TASK  ->  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"2.4 > Back to home channel H\"];\\n        WIFI_TASK  ->  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"...\"];\\n        WIFI_TASK  ->  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"2.x-1 > Scan channel N\"];\\n        WIFI_TASK  ->  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"2.x > Back to home channel H\"];\\n        EVENT_TASK <-  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"3.1 > WIFI_EVENT_SCAN_DONE\"];\\n        APP_TASK   <-  EVENT_TASK [label=\"3.2 > WIFI_EVENT_SCAN_DONE\"];\\n    }\\n\\nThe scenario above is an all-channel background scan. Compared to `Scan All APs on All Channels (Foreground)`_ , the difference in the all-channel background scan is that the Wi-Fi driver will scan the back-to-home channel for 30 ms before it switches to the next channel to give the Wi-Fi connection a chance to transmit/receive data.\\n\\nScan for Specific AP on All Channels\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nScenario:\\n\\n.. seqdiag::\\n    :caption: Scan of specific Wi-Fi Channels\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    seqdiag scan-specific-channels {\\n        activation = none;\\n        node_width = 80;\\n        node_height = 60;\\n        edge_length = 160;\\n        span_height = 5;\\n        default_shape = roundedbox;\\n        default_fontsize = 12;\\n\\n        APP_TASK   [label = \"App\\\\ntask\"];\\n        EVENT_TASK [label = \"Event\\\\ntask\"];\\n        WIFI_TASK  [label = \"Wi-Fi\\\\ntask\"];\\n\\n        APP_TASK   ->  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"1.1 > Configure country code\"];\\n        APP_TASK   ->  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"1.2 > Scan configuration\"];\\n        WIFI_TASK  ->  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"2.1 > Scan channel C1\"];\\n        WIFI_TASK  ->  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"2.2 > Scan channel C2\"];\\n        WIFI_TASK  ->  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"...\"];\\n        WIFI_TASK  ->  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"2.x > Scan channel CN, or the AP is found\"];\\n        EVENT_TASK <-  WIFI_TASK  [label=\"3.1 > WIFI_EVENT_SCAN_DONE\"];\\n        APP_TASK   <-  EVENT_TASK [label=\"3.2 > WIFI_EVENT_SCAN_DONE\"];\\n    }\\n\\nThis scan is similar to `Scan All APs on All Channels (Foreground)`_. The differences are:\\n\\n - s1.1: In step 1.2, the target AP will be configured to SSID/BSSID.\\n - s2.1 ~ s2.N: Each time the Wi-Fi driver scans an AP, it will check whether it is a target AP or not. If the scan is ``WIFI_FAST_SCAN`` scan and the target AP is found, then the scan-done event will arise and scanning will end; otherwise, the scan will continue. Please note that the first scanned channel may not be channel 1, because the Wi-Fi driver optimizes the scanning sequence.\\n\\nIt is a possible situation that there are multiple APs that match the target AP info, e.g., two APs with the SSID of \"ap\" are scanned. In this case, if the scan is ``WIFI_FAST_SCAN``, then only the first scanned \"ap\" will be found. If the scan is ``WIFI_ALL_CHANNEL_SCAN``, both \"ap\" will be found and the station will connect the \"ap\" according to the configured strategy. Refer to `Station Basic Configuration`_.\\n\\nYou can scan a specific AP, or all of them, in any given channel. These two scenarios are very similar.\\n\\nScan in Wi-Fi Connect\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nWhen :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_connect()` is called, the Wi-Fi driver will try to scan the configured AP first. The scan in \"Wi-Fi Connect\" is the same as `Scan for Specific AP On All Channels`_, except that no scan-done event will be generated when the scan is completed. If the target AP is found, the Wi-Fi driver will start the Wi-Fi connection; otherwise, `WIFI_EVENT_STA_DISCONNECTED`_ will be generated. Refer to `Scan for Specific AP On All Channels`_.\\n\\nScan in Blocked Mode\\n++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nIf the block parameter of :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_start()` is true, then the scan is a blocked one, and the application task will be blocked until the scan is done. The blocked scan is similar to an unblocked one, except that no scan-done event will arise when the blocked scan is completed.\\n\\nParallel Scan\\n+++++++++++++\\n\\nTwo application tasks may call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_start()` at the same time, or the same application task calls :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_start()` before it gets a scan-done event. Both scenarios can happen. **However, the Wi-Fi driver does not support multiple concurrent scans adequately. As a result, concurrent scans should be avoided.** Support for concurrent scan will be enhanced in future releases, as the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s Wi-Fi functionality improves continuously.\\n\\nScan When Wi-Fi Is Connecting\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nThe :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_start()` fails immediately if the Wi-Fi is connecting, because the connecting has higher priority than the scan. If scan fails because of connecting, the recommended strategy is to delay for some time and retry scan again. The scan will succeed once the connecting is completed.\\n\\nHowever, the retry/delay strategy may not work all the time. Considering the following scenarios:\\n\\n- The station is connecting a non-existing AP or it connects the existing AP with a wrong password, it always raises the event `WIFI_EVENT_STA_DISCONNECTED`_.\\n- The application calls :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_connect()` to reconnect on receiving the disconnect event.\\n- Another application task, e.g., the console task, calls :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_start()` to do scan, the scan always fails immediately because the station keeps connecting.\\n- When scan fails, the application simply delays for some time and retries the scan.\\n\\nIn the above scenarios, the scan will never succeed because the connecting is in process. So if the application supports similar scenario, it needs to implement a better reconnection strategy. For example:\\n\\n- The application can choose to define a maximum continuous reconnection counter and stop reconnecting once the counter reaches the maximum.\\n- The application can choose to reconnect immediately in the first N continuous reconnection, then give a delay sometime and reconnect again.\\n\\nThe application can define its own reconnection strategy to avoid the scan starve to death. Refer to <`Wi-Fi Reconnect`_>.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi Station Connecting Scenario\\n---------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis scenario depicts the case if only one target AP is found in the scan phase. For scenarios where more than one AP with the same SSID is found, refer to `{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi Station Connecting When Multiple APs Are Found`_.\\n\\nGenerally, the application can ignore the connecting process. Below is a brief introduction to the process for those who are really interested.\\n\\nScenario:\\n\\n.. seqdiag::\\n    :caption: Wi-Fi Station Connecting Process\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    seqdiag station-connecting-process {\\n        activation = none;\\n        node_width = 80;\\n        node_height = 60;\\n        edge_length = 160;\\n        span_height = 5;\\n        default_shape = roundedbox;\\n        default_fontsize = 12;\\n\\n        EVENT_TASK  [label = \"Event\\\\ntask\"];\\n        WIFI_TASK   [label = \"Wi-Fi\\\\ntask\"];\\n        AP          [label = \"AP\"];\\n\\n        === 1.

This reason value is same as defined in section 9.4.1.7 of IEEE 802.11-2020. (For more information, refer to the standard mentioned above.) The last column describes the reason.

The difference is that the station will not raise the event `WIFI_EVENT_STA_DISCONNECTED`_ unless it fails to connect all of the found APs.\\n\\nWi-Fi Reconnect\\n---------------------------\\n\\nThe station may disconnect due to many reasons, e.g., the connected AP is restarted. It is the application\\'s responsibility to reconnect. The recommended reconnection strategy is to call :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_connect()` on receiving event `WIFI_EVENT_STA_DISCONNECTED`_.\\n\\nSometimes the application needs more complex reconnection strategy:\\n\\n- If the disconnect event is raised because the :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_disconnect()` is called, the application may not want to do the reconnection.\\n- If the :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_scan_start()` may be called at anytime, a better reconnection strategy is necessary. Refer to `Scan When Wi-Fi Is Connecting`_.\\n\\nAnother thing that need to be considered is that the reconnection may not connect the same AP if there are more than one APs with the same SSID. The reconnection always select current best APs to connect.\\n\\nWi-Fi Beacon Timeout\\n---------------------------\\n\\nThe beacon timeout mechanism is used by {IDF_TARGET_NAME} station to detect whether the AP is alive or not. If the station does not receive the beacon of the connected AP within the inactive time, the beacon timeout happens. The application can set inactive time via API :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_inactive_time()`.\\n\\nAfter the beacon times out, the station sends 5 probe requests to the AP. If still no probe response or beacon is received from AP, the station disconnects from the AP and raises the event `WIFI_EVENT_STA_DISCONNECTED`_.\\n\\nIt should be considered that the timer used for beacon timeout will be reset during the scanning process. It means that the scan process will affect the triggering of the event `WIFI_EVENT_STA_BEACON_TIMEOUT`_.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi Configuration\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAll configurations will be stored into flash when the Wi-Fi NVS is enabled; otherwise, refer to `Wi-Fi NVS Flash`_.\\n\\nWi-Fi Mode\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nCall :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_mode()` to set the Wi-Fi mode.\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n   :widths: 15 50\\n\\n   * - Mode\\n     - Description\\n   * - ``WIFI_MODE_NULL``\\n     - NULL mode: in this mode, the internal data struct is not allocated to the station and the AP, while both the station and AP interfaces are not initialized for RX/TX Wi-Fi data. Generally, this mode is used for Sniffer, or when you only want to stop both the station and the AP without calling\\xa0:cpp:func:`esp_wifi_deinit()`\\xa0to unload the whole Wi-Fi driver.\\n   * - ``WIFI_MODE_STA``\\n     - Station mode: in this mode,\\xa0:cpp:func:`esp_wifi_start()`\\xa0will init the internal station data, while the station’s interface is ready for the RX and TX Wi-Fi data. After\\xa0:cpp:func:`esp_wifi_connect()`, the station will connect to the target AP.\\n   * - ``WIFI_MODE_AP``\\n     - AP mode: in this mode,\\xa0:cpp:func:`esp_wifi_start()`\\xa0will init the internal AP data, while the AP’s interface is ready for RX/TX Wi-Fi data. Then, the Wi-Fi driver starts broad-casting beacons, and the AP is ready to get connected to other stations.\\n   * - ``WIFI_MODE_APSTA``\\n     - Station/AP coexistence mode: in this mode,\\xa0:cpp:func:`esp_wifi_start()`\\xa0will simultaneously initialize both the station and the AP. This is done in station mode and AP mode. Please note that the channel of the external AP, which the ESP station is connected to, has higher priority over the ESP AP channel.\\n\\n\\nStation Basic Configuration\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nAPI :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_config()` can be used to configure the station. And the configuration will be stored in NVS. The table below describes the fields in detail.\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n   :widths: 15 50\\n\\n   * - Field\\n     - Description\\n   * - ssid\\n     - This is the SSID of the target AP, to which the station wants to connect.\\n   * - password\\n     - Password of the target AP.\\n   * - scan_method\\n     - For ``WIFI_FAST_SCAN`` scan, the scan ends when the first matched AP is found. For ``WIFI_ALL_CHANNEL_SCAN``, the scan finds all matched APs on all channels. The default scan is ``WIFI_FAST_SCAN``.\\n   * - bssid_set\\n     - If bssid_set is 0, the station connects to the AP whose SSID is the same as the field “ssid”, while the field “bssid” is ignored. In all other cases, the station connects to the AP whose SSID is the same as the “ssid” field, while its BSSID is the same the “bssid” field .\\n   * - bssid\\n     - This is valid only when bssid_set is 1; see field “bssid_set”.\\n   * - channel\\n     - If the channel is 0, the station scans the channel 1 ~ N to search for the target AP; otherwise, the station starts by scanning the channel whose value is the same as that of the “channel” field, and then scans the channel 1 ~ N but skip the specific channel to find the target AP. For example, if the channel is 3, the scan order will be 3, 1, 2, 4,..., N. If you do not know which channel the target AP is running on, set it to 0.\\n   * - sort_method\\n     - This field is only for ``WIFI_ALL_CHANNEL_SCAN``.\\n\\n       If the sort_method is ``WIFI_CONNECT_AP_BY_SIGNAL``, all matched APs are sorted by signal, and the AP with the best signal will be connected firstly. For example, the station wants to connect an AP whose SSID is “apxx”. If the scan finds two APs whose SSID equals to “apxx”, and the first AP’s signal is -90 dBm while the second AP’s signal is -30 dBm, the station connects the second AP firstly, and it would not connect the first one unless it fails to connect the second one.\\n\\n       If the sort_method is ``WIFI_CONNECT_AP_BY_SECURITY``, all matched APs are sorted by security. For example, the station wants to connect an AP whose SSID is “apxx”. If the scan finds two APs whose SSID is “apxx”, and the security of the first found AP is open while the second one is WPA2, the station connects to the second AP firstly, and it would not connect the first one unless it fails to connect the second one.\\n   * - threshold\\n     - The threshold is used to filter the found AP. If the RSSI or security mode is less than the configured threshold, the AP will be discarded.\\n\\n       If the RSSI is set to 0, it means the default threshold and the default RSSI threshold are -127 dBm. If the authmode threshold is set to 0, it means the default threshold and the default authmode threshold are open.\\n\\n\\n.. attention::\\n\\n    WEP/WPA security modes are deprecated in IEEE 802.11-2016 specifications and are recommended not to be used. These modes can be rejected using authmode threshold by setting threshold as WPA2 by threshold.authmode as ``WIFI_AUTH_WPA2_PSK``.\\n\\nAP Basic Configuration\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nAPI :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_config()` can be used to configure the AP.

Otherwise, ESP32 chip series devices (except ESP32-C2) will transmit all data in the traditional Wi-Fi data rate.\\n\\n    The following table depicts the Wi-Fi mode negotiation:\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32 or esp32s2 or esp32c3 or esp32s3\\n\\n        +-------+-----+----+---+-------+------+-----+----+\\n        |AP\\\\STA | BGN | BG | B | BGNLR | BGLR | BLR | LR |\\n        +=======+=====+====+===+=======+======+=====+====+\\n        | BGN   | BGN | BG | B | BGN   | BG   | B   | -  |\\n        +-------+-----+----+---+-------+------+-----+----+\\n        | BG    | BG  | BG | B | BG    | BG   | B   | -  |\\n        +-------+-----+----+---+-------+------+-----+----+\\n        | B     | B   | B  | B | B     | B    | B   | -  |\\n        +-------+-----+----+---+-------+------+-----+----+\\n        | BGNLR | -   | -  | - | BGNLR | BGLR | BLR | LR |\\n        +-------+-----+----+---+-------+------+-----+----+\\n        | BGLR  | -   | -  | - | BGLR  | BGLR | BLR | LR |\\n        +-------+-----+----+---+-------+------+-----+----+\\n        | BLR   | -   | -  | - | BLR   | BLR  | BLR | LR |\\n        +-------+-----+----+---+-------+------+-----+----+\\n        | LR    | -   | -  | - | LR    | LR   | LR  | LR |\\n        +-------+-----+----+---+-------+------+-----+----+\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32c6\\n\\n        +---------+-------+-----+----+---+---------+-------+------+-----+----+\\n        | AP\\\\STA  | BGNAX | BGN | BG | B | BGNAXLR | BGNLR | BGLR | BLR | LR |\\n        +=========+=======+=====+====+===+=========+=======+======+=====+====+\\n        | BGNAX   | BGAX  | BGN | BG | B | BGAX    | BGN   | BG   | B   | -  |\\n        +---------+-------+-----+----+---+---------+-------+------+-----+----+\\n        | BGN     | BGN   | BGN | BG | B | BGN     | BGN   | BG   | B   | -  |\\n        +---------+-------+-----+----+---+---------+-------+------+-----+----+\\n        | BG      | BG    | BG  | BG | B | BG      | BG    | BG   | B   | -  |\\n        +---------+-------+-----+----+---+---------+-------+------+-----+----+\\n        | B       | B     | B   | B  | B | B       | B     | B    | B   | -  |\\n        +---------+-------+-----+----+---+---------+-------+------+-----+----+\\n        | BGNAXLR | -     | -   | -  | - | BGAXLR  | BGNLR | BGLR | BLR | LR |\\n        +---------+-------+-----+----+---+---------+-------+------+-----+----+\\n        | BGNLR   | -     | -   | -  | - | BGNLR   | BGNLR | BGLR | BLR | LR |\\n        +---------+-------+-----+----+---+---------+-------+------+-----+----+\\n        | BGLR    | -     | -   | -  | - | BGLR    | BGLR  | BGLR | BLR | LR |\\n        +---------+-------+-----+----+---+---------+-------+------+-----+----+\\n        | BLR     | -     | -   | -  | - | BLR     | BLR   | BLR  | BLR | LR |\\n        +---------+-------+-----+----+---+---------+-------+------+-----+----+\\n        | LR      | -     | -   | -  | - | LR      | LR    | LR   | LR  | LR |\\n        +---------+-------+-----+----+---+---------+-------+------+-----+----+\\n\\n    In the above table, the row is the Wi-Fi mode of AP and the column is the Wi-Fi mode of station. The \"-\" indicates Wi-Fi mode of the AP and station are not compatible.\\n\\n    According to the table, the following conclusions can be drawn:\\n\\n    - For LR-enabled AP of {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, it is incompatible with traditional 802.11 mode, because the beacon is sent in LR mode.\\n    - For LR-enabled station of {IDF_TARGET_NAME} whose mode is NOT LR-only mode, it is compatible with traditional 802.11 mode.\\n    - If both station and AP are ESP32 series chips devices (except ESP32-C2) and both of them have enabled LR mode, the negotiated mode supports LR.\\n\\n    If the negotiated Wi-Fi mode supports both traditional 802.11 mode and LR mode, it is the Wi-Fi driver\\'s responsibility to automatically select the best data rate in different Wi-Fi modes and the application can ignore it.\\n\\n    LR Impacts to Traditional Wi-Fi Device\\n    ***************************************\\n\\n    The data transmission in LR rate has no impacts on the traditional Wi-Fi device because:\\n\\n    - The CCA and backoff process in LR mode are consistent with 802.11 specification.\\n    - The traditional Wi-Fi device can detect the LR signal via CCA and do backoff.\\n\\n    In other words, the transmission impact in LR mode is similar to that in 802.11b mode.\\n\\n    LR Transmission Distance\\n    *************************\\n\\n    The reception sensitivity gain of LR is about 4 dB larger than that of the traditional 802.11b mode. Theoretically, the transmission distance is about 2 to 2.5 times the distance of 11B.\\n\\n    LR Throughput\\n    *************************\\n\\n    The LR rate has very limited throughput, because the raw PHY data rate LR is 1/2 Mbps and 1/4 Mbps.\\n\\n    When to Use LR\\n    *************************\\n\\n    The general conditions for using LR are:\\n\\n    - Both the AP and station are Espressif devices.\\n    - Long distance Wi-Fi connection and data transmission is required.\\n    - Data throughput requirements are very small, such as remote device control.\\n\\nWi-Fi Country Code\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nCall :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_country()` to set the country info. The table below describes the fields in detail.

This attribute identifies the country or noncountry entity in which the station/AP is operating. If it is a country, the first two octets of this string is the two-character country info as described in the document ISO/IEC3166-1. The third octet is one of the following:\\n\\n       - an ASCII space character, which means the regulations under which the station/AP is operating encompass all environments for the current frequency band in the country.\\n       - an ASCII ‘O’ character, which means the regulations under which the station/AP is operating are for an outdoor environment only.\\n       - an ASCII ‘I’ character, which means the regulations under which the station/AP is operating are for an indoor environment only.\\n       - an ASCII ‘X’ character, which means the station/AP is operating under a noncountry entity. The first two octets of the noncountry entity is two ASCII ‘XX’ characters.\\n       - the binary representation of the Operating Class table number currently in use. Refer to Annex E of IEEE Std 802.11-2020.\\n\\n   * - schan\\n     - Start channel. It is the minimum channel number of the regulations under which the station/AP can operate.\\n   * - nchan\\n     - Total number of channels as per the regulations. For example, if the schan=1, nchan=13, then the station/AP can send data from channel 1 to 13.\\n   * - policy\\n     - Country policy. This field controls which country info will be used if the configured country info is in conflict with the connected AP’s. For more details on related policies, see the following section.\\n\\n\\nThe default country info is::\\n\\n    wifi_country_t config = {\\n        .cc = \"01\",\\n        .schan = 1,\\n        .nchan = 11,\\n        .policy = WIFI_COUNTRY_POLICY_AUTO,\\n    };\\n\\nIf the Wi-Fi Mode is station/AP coexist mode, they share the same configured country info. Sometimes, the country info of AP, to which the station is connected, is different from the country info of configured. For example, the configured station has country info::\\n\\n    wifi_country_t config = {\\n        .cc = \"JP\",\\n        .schan = 1,\\n        .nchan = 14,\\n        .policy = WIFI_COUNTRY_POLICY_AUTO,\\n    };\\n\\nbut the connected AP has country info::\\n\\n    wifi_country_t config = {\\n        .cc = \"CN\",\\n        .schan = 1,\\n        .nchan = 13,\\n    };\\n\\nthen country info of connected AP\\'s is used.\\n\\nThe following table depicts which country info is used in different Wi-Fi modes and different country policies, and it also describes the impact on active scan.\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n   :widths: 15 15 35\\n\\n   * - Wi-Fi Mode\\n     - Policy\\n     - Description\\n   * - Station\\n     - WIFI_COUNTRY_POLICY_AUTO\\n     - If the connected AP has country IE in its beacon, the country info equals to the country info in beacon. Otherwise, use the default country info.\\n\\n       For scan:\\n\\n         Use active scan from 1 to 11 and use passive scan from 12 to 14.\\n\\n       Always keep in mind that if an AP with hidden SSID and station is set to a passive scan channel, the passive scan will not find it. In other words, if the application hopes to find the AP with hidden SSID in every channel, the policy of country info should be configured to WIFI_COUNTRY_POLICY_MANUAL.\\n\\n   * - Station\\n     - WIFI_COUNTRY_POLICY_MANUAL\\n     - Always use the configured country info.\\n\\n       For scan:\\n\\n         Use active scan from schan to schan+nchan-1.\\n\\n   * - AP\\n     - WIFI_COUNTRY_POLICY_AUTO\\n     - Always use the configured country info.\\n\\n   * - AP\\n     - WIFI_COUNTRY_POLICY_MANUAL\\n     - Always use the configured country info.\\n\\n   * - Station/AP-coexistence\\n     - WIFI_COUNTRY_POLICY_AUTO\\n     - Station: Same as station mode with policy WIFI_COUNTRY_POLICY_AUTO.\\n       AP: If the station does not connect to any external AP, the AP uses the configured country info.

In station mode, home channel is defined as the channel of AP which the station is connected to. In station/AP-coexistence mode, the home channel of AP and station must be the same, and if they are different, the station\\'s home channel is always in priority. For example, assume that the AP is on channel 6, and the station connects to an AP whose channel is 9. Since the station\\'s home channel has higher priority, the AP needs to switch its channel from 6 to 9 to make sure that it has the same home channel as the station. While switching channel, the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} in AP mode will notify the connected stations about the channel migration using a Channel Switch Announcement (CSA). Station that supports channel switching will transit without disconnecting and reconnecting to the AP.\\n\\n\\nWi-Fi Vendor IE Configuration\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nBy default, all Wi-Fi management frames are processed by the Wi-Fi driver, and the application can ignore them. However, some applications may have to handle the beacon, probe request, probe response, and other management frames. For example, if you insert some vendor-specific IE into the management frames, it is only the management frames which contain this vendor-specific IE that will be processed. In {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_vendor_ie()` and :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_vendor_ie_cb()` are responsible for this kind of tasks.\\n\\nWi-Fi Easy Connect™ (DPP)\\n--------------------------\\n\\nWi-Fi Easy Connect\\\\ :sup:`TM` (or Device Provisioning Protocol) is a secure and standardized provisioning protocol for configuring Wi-Fi devices. More information can be found in :doc:`esp_dpp <../api-reference/network/esp_dpp>`.\\n\\nWPA2-Enterprise\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nWPA2-Enterprise is the secure authentication mechanism for enterprise wireless networks. It uses RADIUS server for authentication of network users before connecting to the Access Point. The authentication process is based on 802.1X policy and comes with different Extended Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods such as TLS, TTLS, and PEAP. RADIUS server authenticates the users based on their credentials (username and password), digital certificates, or both. When {IDF_TARGET_NAME} in station mode tries to connect an AP in enterprise mode, it sends authentication request to AP which is sent to RADIUS server by AP for authenticating the station. Based on different EAP methods, the parameters can be set in configuration which can be opened using ``idf.py menuconfig``. WPA2_Enterprise is supported by {IDF_TARGET_NAME} only in station mode.\\n\\nFor establishing a secure connection, AP and station negotiate and agree on the best possible cipher suite to be used. {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports 802.1X/EAP (WPA) method of AKM and Advanced encryption standard with Counter Mode Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication protocol (AES-CCM) cipher suite. It also supports the cipher suites supported by mbedtls if `USE_MBEDTLS_CRYPTO` flag is set.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} currently supports the following EAP methods:\\n  - EAP-TLS: This is a certificate-based method and only requires SSID and EAP-IDF.\\n  - PEAP: This is a Protected EAP method. Username and Password are mandatory.\\n  - EAP-TTLS: This is a credential-based method. Only server authentication is mandatory while user authentication is optional. Username and Password are mandatory. It supports different Phase2 methods, such as:\\n     - PAP: Password Authentication Protocol.\\n     - CHAP: Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol.\\n     - MSCHAP and MSCHAP-V2.\\n  - EAP-FAST: This is an authentication method based on Protected Access Credentials (PAC) which also uses identity and password. Currently, USE_MBEDTLS_CRYPTO flag should be disabled to use this feature.\\n\\nDetailed information on creating certificates and how to run wpa2_enterprise example on {IDF_TARGET_NAME} can be found in :example:`wifi/wifi_enterprise`.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_WIFI_NAN_SUPPORT\\n\\n    Wi-Fi Aware\\\\ :sup:`TM` (NAN)\\n    ----------------------------\\n\\n    Wi-Fi Aware\\\\ :sup:`TM` or NAN (Neighbor Awareness Networking) is a protocol that allows Wi-Fi devices to discover services in their proximity. NAN uses direct device-to-device communication and does not require any Internet or AP connection.\\n\\n    Multiple NAN devices in the vicinity will form a NAN cluster which allows them to communicate with each other. NAN devices in a cluster synchronise their clocks and listen to each other periodically on Channel 6. Devices can advertise (Publish) or seek for (Subscribe) services within their NAN Cluster using Service Discovery protocols. Matching of services is done by service name and optionally matching filters. Once a Subscriber gets a match with a Publisher, it can either send a message (Follow-up) or establish a datapath (NDP) with the Publisher. After NDP is setup both devices will obtain an IPv6 address and can use it for communication.\\n\\n    Please note that NAN Datapath security is not supported i.e., the data packets will go out unencrypted. NAN uses a separate interface for Discovery and Datapath, which is other than that used for STA and AP. NAN operates in standalone mode, which means co-existence with STA or AP interface is not supported.\\n\\n    Refer to ESP-IDF examples :idf_file:`examples/wifi/wifi_aware/nan_publisher/README.md` and :idf_file:`examples/wifi/wifi_aware/nan_subscriber/README.md` to setup a NAN Publisher and Subscriber.\\n\\nWireless Network Management\\n----------------------------\\n\\nWireless Network Management allows client devices to exchange information about the network topology, including information related to RF environment. This makes each client network-aware, facilitating overall improvement in the performance of the wireless network. It is part of 802.11v specification. It also enables the client to support Network assisted Roaming.\\n- Network assisted Roaming: Enables WLAN to send messages to associated clients, resulting clients to associate with APs with better link metrics. This is useful for both load balancing and in directing poorly connected clients.\\n\\nCurrent implementation of 802.11v includes support for BSS transition management frames.\\n\\nRadio Resource Measurement\\n---------------------------\\n\\nRadio Resource Measurement (802.11k) is intended to improve the way traffic is distributed within a network. In a WLAN, each device normally connects to the access point (AP) that provides the strongest signal. Depending on the number and geographic locations of the subscribers, this arrangement can sometimes lead to excessive demand on one AP and underutilization of others, resulting in degradation of overall network performance. In a network conforming to 802.11k, if the AP having the strongest signal is loaded to its full capacity, a wireless device can be moved to one of the underutilized APs. Even though the signal may be weaker, the overall throughput is greater because more efficient use is made of the network resources.\\n\\nCurrent implementation of 802.11k includes support for beacon measurement report, link measurement report, and neighbor request.\\n\\nRefer ESP-IDF example :idf_file:`examples/wifi/roaming/README.md` to set up and use these APIs. Example code only demonstrates how these APIs can be used, and the application should define its own algorithm and cases as required.\\n\\nFast BSS Transition\\n---------------------------\\nFast BSS transition (802.11R FT), is a standard to permit continuous connectivity aboard wireless devices in motion, with fast and secure client transitions from one Basic Service Set (abbreviated BSS, and also known as a base station or more colloquially, an access point) to another performed in a nearly seamless manner **avoiding 802.1i 4 way handshake** . 802.11R specifies transitions between access points by redefining the security key negotiation protocol, allowing both the negotiation and requests for wireless resources to occur in parallel. The key derived from the server to be cached in the wireless network, so that a reasonable number of future connections can be based on the cached key, avoiding the 802.1X process\\n\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} station supports FT for WPA2-PSK networks. Do note that {IDF_TARGET_NAME} station only support FT over the air protocol only.\\n\\nA config option :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_11R_SUPPORT` and configuration parameter :cpp:type:`ft_enabled` in :cpp:type:`wifi_sta_config_t` is provided to enable 802.11R support for station. Refer ESP-IDF example :idf_file:`examples/wifi/roaming/README.md` for further details.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_WIFI_FTM_SUPPORT\\n\\n    Wi-Fi Location\\n    -------------------------------\\n\\n    Wi-Fi Location will improve the accuracy of a device\\'s location data beyond the Access Point, which will enable creation of new and feature-rich applications and services such as geo-fencing, network management, and navigation. One of the protocols used to determine the device location with respect to the Access Point is Fine Timing Measurement which calculates Time-of-Flight of a Wi-Fi frame.\\n\\n    Fine Timing Measurement (FTM)\\n    +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n    FTM is used to measure Wi-Fi Round Trip Time (Wi-Fi RTT) which is the time a Wi-Fi signal takes to travel from a device to another device and back again. Using Wi-Fi RTT, the distance between the devices can be calculated with a simple formula of `RTT * c / 2`, where c is the speed of light.\\n\\n    FTM uses timestamps given by Wi-Fi interface hardware at the time of arrival or departure of frames exchanged between a pair of devices. One entity called FTM Initiator (mostly a station device) discovers the FTM Responder (can be a station or an Access Point) and negotiates to start an FTM procedure. The procedure uses multiple Action frames sent in bursts and its ACK\\'s to gather the timestamps data. FTM Initiator gathers the data in the end to calculate an average Round-Trip-Time.\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports FTM in below configuration:\\n\\n    - {IDF_TARGET_NAME} as FTM Initiator in station mode.\\n    - {IDF_TARGET_NAME} as FTM Responder in AP mode.\\n\\n    Distance measurement using RTT is not accurate, and factors such as RF interference, multi-path travel, antenna orientation, and lack of calibration increase these inaccuracies. For better results, it is suggested to perform FTM between two ESP32 chip series devices (except ESP32-C2) as station and AP.\\n\\n    Refer to ESP-IDF example :idf_file:`examples/wifi/ftm/README.md` for steps on how to set up and perform FTM.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi Power-saving Mode\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\nThis subsection will briefly introduce the concepts and usage related to Wi-Fi Power Saving Mode, for a more detailed introduction please refer to the :doc:`Low Power Mode User Guide <../api-guides/low-power-mode>`\\n\\nStation Sleep\\n++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nCurrently, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi supports the Modem-sleep mode which refers to the legacy power-saving mode in the IEEE 802.11 protocol. Modem-sleep mode works in station-only mode and the station must connect to the AP first. If the Modem-sleep mode is enabled, station will switch between active and sleep state periodically. In sleep state, RF, PHY and BB are turned off in order to reduce power consumption. Station can keep connection with AP in modem-sleep mode.\\n\\nModem-sleep mode includes minimum and maximum power-saving modes. In minimum power-saving mode, station wakes up every DTIM to receive beacon. Broadcast data will not be lost because it is transmitted after DTIM. However, it cannot save much more power if DTIM is short for DTIM is determined by AP.\\n\\nIn maximum power-saving mode, station wakes up in every listen interval to receive beacon. This listen interval can be set to be longer than the AP DTIM period. Broadcast data may be lost because station may be in sleep state at DTIM time. If listen interval is longer, more power is saved, but broadcast data is more easy to lose. Listen interval can be configured by calling API :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_config()` before connecting to AP.\\n\\nCall ``esp_wifi_set_ps(WIFI_PS_MIN_MODEM)`` to enable Modem-sleep minimum power-saving mode or ``esp_wifi_set_ps(WIFI_PS_MAX_MODEM)`` to enable Modem-sleep maximum power-saving mode after calling :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_init()`. When station connects to AP, Modem-sleep will start. When station disconnects from AP, Modem-sleep will stop.\\n\\nCall ``esp_wifi_set_ps(WIFI_PS_NONE)`` to disable Modem-sleep mode entirely. Disabling it increases power consumption, but minimizes the delay in receiving Wi-Fi data in real time. When Modem-sleep mode is enabled, the delay in receiving Wi-Fi data may be the same as the DTIM cycle (minimum power-saving mode) or the listening interval (maximum power-saving mode).\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SUPPORT_COEXISTENCE\\n\\n    Note that in coexist mode, Wi-Fi will remain active only during Wi-Fi time slice, and sleep during non Wi-Fi time slice even if ``esp_wifi_set_ps(WIFI_PS_NONE)`` is called. Please refer to :ref:`coexist policy <coexist_policy>`.\\n\\nThe default Modem-sleep mode is WIFI_PS_MIN_MODEM.\\n\\nAP Sleep\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nCurrently, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} AP does not support all of the power-saving feature defined in Wi-Fi specification. To be specific, the AP only caches unicast data for the stations connect to this AP, but does not cache the multicast data for the stations. If stations connected to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} AP are power-saving enabled, they may experience multicast packet loss.\\n\\nIn the future, all power-saving features will be supported on {IDF_TARGET_NAME} AP.\\n\\nDisconnected State Sleep\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nDisconnected state is the duration without Wi-Fi connection between :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_start` to :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_stop`.\\n\\nCurrently, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi supports sleep mode in disconnected state if running at station mode. This feature could be configured by Menuconfig choice :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_STA_DISCONNECTED_PM_ENABLE`.\\n\\nIf :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_STA_DISCONNECTED_PM_ENABLE` is enabled, RF, PHY and BB would be turned off in disconnected state when IDLE. The current would be same with current at modem-sleep.\\n\\nThe choice :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_STA_DISCONNECTED_PM_ENABLE` would be selected by default, while it would be selected forcefully in Menuconfig at coexistence mode.\\n\\n.. _connectionless-module-power-save:\\n\\nConnectionless Modules Power-saving\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nConnectionless modules are those Wi-Fi modules not relying on Wi-Fi connection, e.g ESP-NOW, DPP, FTM. These modules start from :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_start`, working until :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_stop`.\\n\\nCurrently, if ESP-NOW works at station mode, its supported to sleep at both connected state and disconnected state.\\n\\nConnectionless Modules TX\\n*******************************\\n\\nFor each connectionless module, its supported to TX at any sleeping time without any extra configuration.\\n\\nMeanwhile, :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_80211_tx` is supported at sleep as well.\\n\\nConnectionless Modules RX\\n*******************************\\n\\nFor each connectionless module, two parameters shall be configured to RX at sleep, which are `Window` and `Interval`.\\n\\nAt the start of `Interval` time, RF, PHY, BB would be turned on and kept for `Window` time. Connectionless Module could RX in the duration.\\n\\n**Interval**\\n\\n - There is only one `Interval`. Its configured by :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_connectionless_interval`. The unit is milliseconds.\\n\\n - The default value of `Interval` is `ESP_WIFI_CONNECTIONLESS_INTERVAL_DEFAULT_MODE`.\\n\\n - Event `WIFI_EVENT_CONNECTIONLESS_MODULE_WAKE_INTERVAL_START`_ would be posted at the start of `Interval`.

Send the beacon, probe request, probe response, and action frame.\\n - Send the non-QoS data frame.\\n\\nIt cannot be used for sending encrypted or QoS frames.\\n\\nPreconditions of Using :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_80211_tx()`\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n - The Wi-Fi mode is station, or AP, or station/AP.\\n - Either ``esp_wifi_set_promiscuous(true)``, or :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_start()`, or both of these APIs return :c:macro:`ESP_OK`. This is because Wi-Fi hardware must be initialized before :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_80211_tx()` is called. In {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, both ``esp_wifi_set_promiscuous(true)`` and :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_start()` can trigger the initialization of Wi-Fi hardware.\\n - The parameters of :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_80211_tx()` are hereby correctly provided.\\n\\nData Rate\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n - The default data rate is 1 Mbps.\\n - Can set any rate through :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_config_80211_tx_rate()` API.\\n - Can set any bandwidth through :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_bandwidth()` API.\\n\\nSide-Effects to Avoid in Different Scenarios\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nTheoretically, if the side-effects the API imposes on the Wi-Fi driver or other stations/APs are not considered, a raw 802.11 packet can be sent over the air with any destination MAC, any source MAC, any BSSID, or any other types of packet. However, robust or useful applications should avoid such side-effects. The table below provides some tips and recommendations on how to avoid the side-effects of :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_80211_tx()` in different scenarios.\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n   :widths: 10 50\\n\\n   * - Scenario\\n     - Description\\n   * - No Wi-Fi connection\\n     - In this scenario, no Wi-Fi connection is set up, so there are no side-effects on the Wi-Fi driver. If ``en_sys_seq==true``, the Wi-Fi driver is responsible for the sequence control. If ``en_sys_seq==false``, the application needs to ensure that the buffer has the correct sequence.\\n\\n       Theoretically, the MAC address can be any address. However, this may impact other stations/APs with the same MAC/BSSID.\\n\\n       Side-effect example#1 The application calls :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_80211_tx()` to send a beacon with BSSID == mac_x in AP mode, but the mac_x is not the MAC of the AP interface. Moreover, there is another AP, e.g., “other-AP”, whose BSSID is mac_x. If this happens, an “unexpected behavior” may occur, because the stations which connect to the “other-AP” cannot figure out whether the beacon is from the “other-AP” or the :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_80211_tx()`.\\n\\n       To avoid the above-mentioned side-effects, it is recommended that:\\n\\n       - If :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_80211_tx` is called in station mode, the first MAC should be a multicast MAC or the exact target-device’s MAC, while the second MAC should be that of the station interface.\\n\\n       - If :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_80211_tx` is called in AP mode, the first MAC should be a multicast MAC or the exact target-device’s MAC, while the second MAC should be that of the AP interface.\\n\\n       The recommendations above are only for avoiding side-effects and can be ignored when there are good reasons.\\n\\n   * - Have Wi-Fi connection\\n     - When the Wi-Fi connection is already set up, and the sequence is controlled by the application, the latter may impact the sequence control of the Wi-Fi connection as a whole. So, the ``en_sys_seq`` need to be true, otherwise ``ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG`` is returned.\\n\\n       The MAC-address recommendations in the “No Wi-Fi connection” scenario also apply to this scenario.\\n\\n       If the Wi-Fi mode is station mode, the MAC address1 is the MAC of AP to which the station is connected, and the MAC address2 is the MAC of station interface, it is said that the packet is sent from the station to AP. Otherwise, if the Wi-Fi is in AP mode, the MAC address1 is the MAC of the station that connects to this AP, and the MAC address2 is the MAC of AP interface, it is said that the packet is sent from the AP to station. To avoid conflicting with Wi-Fi connections, the following checks are applied:\\n\\n       - If the packet type is data and is sent from the station to AP, the ToDS bit in IEEE 80211 frame control should be 1 and the FromDS bit should be 0. Otherwise, the packet will be discarded by Wi-Fi driver.\\n\\n       - If the packet type is data and is sent from the AP to station, the ToDS bit in IEEE 80211 frame control should be 0 and the FromDS bit should be 1. Otherwise, the packet will be discarded by Wi-Fi driver.\\n\\n       - If the packet is sent from station to AP or from AP to station, the Power Management, More Data, and Re-Transmission bits should be 0. Otherwise, the packet will be discarded by Wi-Fi driver.\\n\\n       ``ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG`` is returned if any check fails.\\n\\n\\nWi-Fi Sniffer Mode\\n---------------------------\\n\\nThe Wi-Fi sniffer mode can be enabled by :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_promiscuous`. If the sniffer mode is enabled, the following packets **can** be dumped to the application:\\n\\n - 802.11 Management frame.\\n - 802.11 Data frame, including MPDU, AMPDU, and AMSDU.\\n - 802.11 MIMO frame, for MIMO frame, the sniffer only dumps the length of the frame.\\n - 802.11 Control frame.\\n - 802.11 CRC error frame.\\n\\nThe following packets will **NOT** be dumped to the application:\\n\\n - Other 802.11 error frames.\\n\\nFor frames that the sniffer **can** dump, the application can additionally decide which specific type of packets can be filtered to the application by using :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_promiscuous_filter()` and :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_promiscuous_ctrl_filter()`. By default, it will filter all 802.11 data and management frames to the application.\\n\\nThe Wi-Fi sniffer mode can be enabled in the Wi-Fi mode of :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_MODE_NULL`, :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_MODE_STA`, :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_MODE_AP`, or :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_MODE_APSTA`. In other words, the sniffer mode is active when the station is connected to the AP, or when the AP has a Wi-Fi connection. Please note that the sniffer has a **great impact** on the throughput of the station or AP Wi-Fi connection. Generally, the sniffer should be enabled **only if** the station/AP Wi-Fi connection does not experience heavy traffic.\\n\\nAnother noteworthy issue about the sniffer is the callback :cpp:type:`wifi_promiscuous_cb_t`. The callback will be called directly in the Wi-Fi driver task, so if the application has a lot of work to do for each filtered packet, the recommendation is to post an event to the application task in the callback and defer the real work to the application task.\\n\\nWi-Fi Multiple Antennas\\n--------------------------\\nThe Wi-Fi multiple antennas selecting can be depicted as following picture::\\n\\n                    __________\\n                   |Enabled   |\\n                ___|Antenna 0 |\\\\\\\\                                              _________\\n                   |__________| \\\\\\\\        GPIO[0] <----> antenna_select[0] ---|         | --- antenna 0\\n    RX/TX ___                    \\\\\\\\____\\\\  GPIO[1] <----> antenna_select[1] ---| Antenna | --- antenna 1\\n             \\\\      __________   //    /  GPIO[2] <----> antenna_select[2] ---| Switch  | ...  ...\\n              \\\\ ___|Enabled   | //        GPIO[3] <----> antenna_select[3] ---|_________| --- antenna 15\\n               \\\\   |Antenna 1 |//\\n                   |__________|\\n\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports up to sixteen antennas through external antenna switch. The antenna switch can be controlled by up to four address pins - antenna_select[0:3]. Different input value of antenna_select[0:3] means selecting different antenna. For example, the value \\'0b1011\\' means the antenna 11 is selected. The default value of antenna_select[3:0] is \\'0b0000\\', which means the antenna 0 is selected by default.\\n\\nUp to four GPIOs are connected to the four active high antenna_select pins. {IDF_TARGET_NAME} can select the antenna by control the GPIO[0:3]. The API :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_ant_gpio()` is used to configure which GPIOs are connected to antenna_selects. If GPIO[x] is connected to antenna_select[x], then gpio_config->gpio_cfg[x].gpio_select should be set to 1 and gpio_config->gpio_cfg[x].gpio_num should be provided.\\n\\nFor the specific implementation of the antenna switch, there may be illegal values in `antenna_select[0:3]`. It means that {IDF_TARGET_NAME} may support less than sixteen antennas through the switch. For example, ESP32-WROOM-DA which uses RTC6603SP as the antenna switch, supports two antennas. Two GPIOs are connected to two active high antenna selection inputs. The value \\'0b01\\' means the antenna 0 is selected, the value \\'0b10\\' means the antenna 1 is selected. Values \\'0b00\\' and \\'0b11\\' are illegal.\\n\\nAlthough up to sixteen antennas are supported, only one or two antennas can be simultaneously enabled for RX/TX. The API :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_ant()` is used to configure which antennas are enabled.\\n\\nThe enabled antennas selecting algorithm is also configured by :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_ant()`. The RX/TX antenna mode can be :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_ANT_MODE_ANT0`, :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_ANT_MODE_ANT1`, or :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_ANT_MODE_AUTO`. If the antenna mode is :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_ANT_MODE_ANT0`, the enabled antenna 0 is selected for RX/TX data. If the antenna mode is :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_ANT_MODE_ANT1`, the enabled antenna 1 is selected for RX/TX data. Otherwise, Wi-Fi automatically selects the enabled antenna that has better signal.\\n\\nIf the RX antenna mode is :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_ANT_MODE_AUTO`, the default antenna mode also needs to be set, because the RX antenna switching only happens when some conditions are met. For example, the RX antenna starts to switch if the RSSI is lower than -65 dBm or another antenna has better signal. RX uses the default antenna if the conditions are not met. If the default antenna mode is :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_ANT_MODE_ANT1`, the enabled antenna 1 is used as the default RX antenna, otherwise the enabled antenna 0 is used.\\n\\nSome limitations need to be considered:\\n\\n - The TX antenna can be set to :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_ANT_MODE_AUTO` only if the RX antenna mode is :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_ANT_MODE_AUTO`, because TX antenna selecting algorithm is based on RX antenna in :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_ANT_MODE_AUTO` type.\\n - When the TX antenna mode or RX antenna mode is configured to :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_ANT_MODE_AUTO` the switching mode will easily trigger the switching phase, as long as there is deterioration of the RF signal. So in situations where the RF signal is not stable, the antenna switching will occur frequently, resulting in an RF performance that may not meet expectations.\\n - Currently, Bluetooth® does not support the multiple antennas feature, so please do not use multiple antennas related APIs.\\n\\nFollowing is the recommended scenarios to use the multiple antennas:\\n\\n - The applications can always choose to select a specified antenna or implement their own antenna selecting algorithm, e.g., selecting the antenna mode based on the information collected by the application.

For example, if four antennas are supported and GPIO20/GPIO21 are connected to antenna_select[0]/antenna_select[1], the configurations look like:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    wifi_ant_gpio_config_t ant_gpio_config = {\\n        .gpio_cfg[0] = { .gpio_select = 1, .gpio_num = 20 },\\n        .gpio_cfg[1] = { .gpio_select = 1, .gpio_num = 21 }\\n    };\\n\\n- Configure which antennas are enabled and how RX/TX use the enabled antennas. For example, if antenna1 and antenna3 are enabled, the RX needs to select the better antenna automatically and uses antenna1 as its default antenna, the TX always selects the antenna3. The configuration looks like:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    wifi_ant_config_t config = {\\n        .rx_ant_mode = WIFI_ANT_MODE_AUTO,\\n        .rx_ant_default = WIFI_ANT_ANT0,\\n        .tx_ant_mode = WIFI_ANT_MODE_ANT1,\\n        .enabled_ant0 = 1,\\n        .enabled_ant1 = 3\\n    };\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_WIFI_CSI_SUPPORT\\n\\n    Wi-Fi Channel State Information\\n    ------------------------------------\\n\\n    Channel state information (CSI) refers to the channel information of a Wi-Fi connection. In {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, this information consists of channel frequency responses of sub-carriers and is estimated when packets are received from the transmitter. Each channel frequency response of sub-carrier is recorded by two bytes of signed characters. The first one is imaginary part and the second one is real part. There are up to three fields of channel frequency responses according to the type of received packet. They are legacy long training field (LLTF), high throughput LTF (HT-LTF), and space time block code HT-LTF (STBC-HT-LTF). For different types of packets which are received on channels with different state, the sub-carrier index and total bytes of signed characters of CSI are shown in the following table.\\n\\n    +-------------+--------------------+-----------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+\\n    | channel     | secondary channel  |                   none                  |                           below                        |                            above                         |\\n    +-------------+--------------------+-------------+---------------------------+----------+---------------------------------------------+----------+-----------------------------------------------+\\n    | packet      | signal mode        |   non HT    |            HT             |  non HT  |                      HT                     |  non HT  |                       HT                      |\\n    +             +--------------------+-------------+---------------------------+----------+-----------------+---------------------------+----------+-------------------+---------------------------+\\n    | information | channel bandwidth  |    20 MHz   |           20 MHz          |   20 MHz |      20 MHz     |            40 MHz         |   20 MHz |       20 MHz      |            40 MHz         |\\n    +             +--------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+----------+----------+------+-------------+-------------+----------+----------+--------+-------------+-------------+\\n    |             | STBC               |  non STBC   |  non STBC   |     STBC    | non STBC | non STBC | STBC |  non STBC   |     STBC    | non STBC | non STBC |  STBC  |  non STBC   |     STBC    |\\n    +-------------+--------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+----------+----------+------+-------------+-------------+----------+----------+--------+-------------+-------------+\\n    | sub-carrier | LLTF               | 0~31, -32~-1| 0~31, -32~-1| 0~31, -32~-1|   0~63   |   0~63   | 0~63 |     0~63    |     0~63    |  -64~-1  |  -64~-1  | -64~-1 |    -64~-1   |    -64~-1   |\\n    +             +--------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+----------+----------+------+-------------+-------------+----------+----------+--------+-------------+-------------+\\n    | index       | HT-LTF             |      -      | 0~31, -32~-1| 0~31, -32~-1|     -    |   0~63   | 0~62 | 0~63, -64~-1| 0~60, -60~-1|     -    |  -64~-1  | -62~-1 | 0~63, -64~-1| 0~60, -60~-1|\\n    +             +--------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+----------+----------+------+-------------+-------------+----------+----------+--------+-------------+-------------+\\n    |             | STBC-HT-LTF        |      -      |      -      | 0~31, -32~-1|     -    |     -    | 0~62 |       -     | 0~60, -60~-1|     -    |     -    | -62~-1 |       -     | 0~60, -60~-1|\\n    +-------------+--------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+----------+----------+------+-------------+-------------+----------+----------+--------+-------------+-------------+\\n    | total bytes                      |     128     |     256     |     384     |    128   |    256   | 380  |      384    |      612    |    128   |    256   |   376  |      384    |      612    |\\n    +----------------------------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+----------+----------+------+-------------+-------------+----------+----------+--------+-------------+-------------+\\n\\n    All of the information in the table can be found in the structure wifi_csi_info_t.\\n\\n        - Secondary channel refers to secondary_channel field of rx_ctrl field.\\n        - Signal mode of packet refers to sig_mode field of rx_ctrl field.\\n        - Channel bandwidth refers to cwb field of rx_ctrl field.\\n        - STBC refers to stbc field of rx_ctrl field.\\n        - Total bytes refers to len field.\\n        - The CSI data corresponding to each Long Training Field (LTF) type is stored in a buffer starting from the buf field. Each item is stored as two bytes: imaginary part followed by real part. The order of each item is the same as the sub-carrier in the table. The order of LTF is: LLTF, HT-LTF, STBC-HT-LTF. However, all 3 LTFs may not be present, depending on the channel and packet information (see above).\\n        - If first_word_invalid field of :cpp:type:`wifi_csi_info_t` is true, it means that the first four bytes of CSI data is invalid due to a hardware limitation in {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.\\n        - More information like RSSI, noise floor of RF, receiving time and antenna is in the rx_ctrl field.\\n\\n    When imaginary part and real part data of sub-carrier are used, please refer to the table below.\\n\\n    +-----------------+-------------------+------------------------------+--------------------------+\\n    | PHY standard    | Sub-carrier range | Pilot sub-carrier            | Sub-carrier (total/data) |\\n    +=================+===================+==============================+==========================+\\n    | 802.11a/g       | -26 to +26        | -21, -7, +7, +21             | 52 total, 48 usable      |\\n    +-----------------+-------------------+------------------------------+--------------------------+\\n    | 802.11n, 20 MHz | -28 to +28        | -21, -7, +7, +21             | 56 total, 52 usable      |\\n    +-----------------+-------------------+------------------------------+--------------------------+\\n    | 802.11n, 40 MHz | -57 to +57        | -53, -25, -11, +11, +25, +53 | 114 total, 108 usable    |\\n    +-----------------+-------------------+------------------------------+--------------------------+\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        - For STBC packet, CSI is provided for every space-time stream without CSD (cyclic shift delay). As each cyclic shift on the additional chains shall be -200 ns, only the CSD angle of first space-time stream is recorded in sub-carrier 0 of HT-LTF and STBC-HT-LTF for there is no channel frequency response in sub-carrier 0. CSD[10:0] is 11 bits, ranging from -pi to pi.\\n\\n        - If LLTF, HT-LTF, or STBC-HT-LTF is not enabled by calling API :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_csi_config()`, the total bytes of CSI data will be fewer than that in the table. For example, if LLTF and HT-LTF is not enabled and STBC-HT-LTF is enabled, when a packet is received with the condition above/HT/40MHz/STBC, the total bytes of CSI data is 244 ((61 + 60) * 2 + 2 = 244. The result is aligned to four bytes, and the last two bytes are invalid).\\n\\n    Wi-Fi Channel State Information Configure\\n    -------------------------------------------\\n\\n    To use Wi-Fi CSI, the following steps need to be done.\\n\\n        - Select Wi-Fi CSI in menuconfig. Go to ``Menuconfig`` > ``Components config`` > ``Wi-Fi`` > ``Wi-Fi CSI (Channel State Information)``.\\n        - Set CSI receiving callback function by calling API :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_csi_rx_cb()`.\\n        - Configure CSI by calling API :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_csi_config()`.\\n        - Enable CSI by calling API :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_csi()`.\\n\\n    The CSI receiving callback function runs from Wi-Fi task. So, do not do lengthy operations in the callback function. Instead, post necessary data to a queue and handle it from a lower priority task. Because station does not receive any packet when it is disconnected and only receives packets from AP when it is connected, it is suggested to enable sniffer mode to receive more CSI data by calling :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_promiscuous()`.\\n\\nWi-Fi HT20/40\\n-------------------------\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32s2 or esp32c3 or esp32s3 or esp32c6\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports Wi-Fi bandwidth HT20 or HT40 and does not support HT20/40 coexist. :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_bandwidth()` can be used to change the default bandwidth of station or AP. The default bandwidth for {IDF_TARGET_NAME} station and AP is HT40.\\n\\n    In station mode, the actual bandwidth is firstly negotiated during the Wi-Fi connection. It is HT40 only if both the station and the connected AP support HT40, otherwise it is HT20. If the bandwidth of connected AP is changes, the actual bandwidth is negotiated again without Wi-Fi disconnecting.\\n\\n    Similarly, in AP mode, the actual bandwidth is negotiated between AP and the stations that connect to the AP. It is HT40 if the AP and one of the stations support HT40, otherwise it is HT20.\\n\\n    In station/AP coexist mode, the station/AP can configure HT20/40 seperately. If both station and AP are negotiated to HT40, the HT40 channel should be the channel of station because the station always has higher priority than AP in {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. For example, the configured bandwidth of AP is HT40, the configured primary channel is 6, and the configured secondary channel is 10. The station is connected to an router whose primary channel is 6 and secondary channel is 2, then the actual channel of AP is changed to primary 6 and secondary 2 automatically.\\n\\n    Theoretically, the HT40 can gain better throughput because the maximum raw physicial (PHY) data rate for HT40 is 150 Mbps while it is 72 Mbps for HT20. However, if the device is used in some special environment, e.g., there are too many other Wi-Fi devices around the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} device, the performance of HT40 may be degraded. So if the applications need to support same or similar scenarios, it is recommended that the bandwidth is always configured to HT20.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c2\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports Wi-Fi bandwidth HT20 and does not support Wi-Fi bandwidth HT40 or HT20/40 coexist.\\n\\nWi-Fi QoS\\n-------------------------\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports all the mandatory features required in WFA Wi-Fi QoS Certification.\\n\\nFour ACs (Access Category) are defined in Wi-Fi specification, and each AC has its own priority to access the Wi-Fi channel. Moreover, a map rule is defined to map the QoS priority of other protocol, e.g., 802.11D or TCP/IP precedence is mapped to Wi-Fi AC.\\n\\nThe table below describes how the IP Precedences are mapped to Wi-Fi ACs in {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. It also indicates whether the AMPDU is supported for this AC. The table is sorted from high to low priority. That is to say, the AC_VO has the highest priority.\\n\\n+------------------+------------------------+-----------------+\\n| IP Precedence    | Wi-Fi AC               |  Support AMPDU? |\\n+==================+========================+=================+\\n| 6, 7             | AC_VO (Voice)          |  No             |\\n+------------------+------------------------+-----------------+\\n| 4, 5             | AC_VI (Video)          |  Yes            |\\n+------------------+------------------------+-----------------+\\n| 3, 0             | AC_BE (Best Effort)    |  Yes            |\\n+------------------+------------------------+-----------------+\\n| 1, 2             | AC_BK (Background)     |  Yes            |\\n+------------------+------------------------+-----------------+\\n\\nThe application can make use of the QoS feature by configuring the IP precedence via socket option IP_TOS. Here is an example to make the socket to use VI queue::\\n\\n    const int ip_precedence_vi = 4;\\n    const int ip_precedence_offset = 5;\\n    int priority = (ip_precedence_vi << ip_precedence_offset);\\n    setsockopt(socket_id, IPPROTO_IP, IP_TOS, &priority, sizeof(priority));\\n\\nTheoretically, the higher priority AC has better performance than the lower priority AC. However, it is not always true. Here are some suggestions about how to use the Wi-Fi QoS:\\n\\n - Some really important application traffic can be put into the AC_VO queue. But avoid using the AC_VO queue for heavy traffic, as it may impact the management frames which also use this queue. Eventually, it is worth noting that the AC_VO queue does not support AMPDU, and its performance with heavy traffic is no better than other queues.\\n - Avoid using more than two precedences supported by different AMPDUs, e.g., when socket A uses precedence 0, socket B uses precedence 1, and socket C uses precedence 2. This can be a bad design because it may need much more memory. To be specific, the Wi-Fi driver may generate a Block Ack session for each precedence and it needs more memory if the Block Ack session is set up.\\n\\n\\nWi-Fi AMSDU\\n-------------------------\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_SPIRAM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports receiving AMSDU.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPIRAM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports receiving and transmitting AMSDU. AMSDU TX is disabled by default, since enable AMSDU TX need more memory. Select :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_AMSDU_TX_ENABLED` to enable AMSDU Tx feature, it depends on :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM`.\\n\\nWi-Fi Fragment\\n-------------------------\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32s2\\n\\n    supports Wi-Fi receiving fragment, but does not support Wi-Fi transmitting fragment.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c3 or esp32s3 or esp32c6\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports Wi-Fi receiving and transmitting fragment.\\n\\nWPS Enrollee\\n-------------------------\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports WPS enrollee feature in Wi-Fi mode :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_MODE_STA` or :cpp:enumerator:`WIFI_MODE_APSTA`. Currently, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports WPS enrollee type PBC and PIN.\\n\\n.. _wifi-buffer-usage:\\n\\nWi-Fi Buffer Usage\\n--------------------------\\n\\nThis section is only about the dynamic buffer configuration.\\n\\nWhy Buffer Configuration Is Important\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nIn order to get a high-performance system, consider the memory usage/configuration carefully for the following reasons:\\n\\n - the available memory in {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is limited.\\n - currently, the default type of buffer in LwIP and Wi-Fi drivers is \"dynamic\", **which means that both the LwIP and Wi-Fi share memory with the application**. Programmers should always keep this in mind; otherwise, they will face a memory issue, such as \"running out of heap memory\".\\n - it is very dangerous to run out of heap memory, as this will cause {IDF_TARGET_NAME} an \"undefined behavior\". Thus, enough heap memory should be reserved for the application, so that it never runs out of it.\\n - the Wi-Fi throughput heavily depends on memory-related configurations, such as the TCP window size and Wi-Fi RX/TX dynamic buffer number.\\n - the peak heap memory that the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} LwIP/Wi-Fi may consume depends on a number of factors, such as the maximum TCP/UDP connections that the application may have.\\n - the total memory that the application requires is also an important factor when considering memory configuration.\\n\\nDue to these reasons, there is not a good-for-all application configuration. Rather, it is recommended to consider memory configurations separately for every different application.\\n\\nDynamic vs. Static Buffer\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nThe default type of buffer in Wi-Fi drivers is \"dynamic\". Most of the time the dynamic buffer can significantly save memory. However, it makes the application programming a little more difficult, because in this case the application needs to consider memory usage in Wi-Fi.\\n\\nlwIP also allocates buffers at the TCP/IP layer, and this buffer allocation is also dynamic. See :ref:`lwIP documentation section about memory use and performance <lwip-performance>`.\\n\\nPeak Wi-Fi Dynamic Buffer\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nThe Wi-Fi driver supports several types of buffer (refer to `Wi-Fi Buffer Configure`_). However, this section is about the usage of the dynamic Wi-Fi buffer only.\\nThe peak heap memory that Wi-Fi consumes is the **theoretically-maximum memory** that the Wi-Fi driver consumes. Generally, the peak memory depends on:\\n\\n- :math:`b_{rx}` the number of dynamic RX buffers that are configured\\n- :math:`b_{tx}` the number of dynamic TX buffers that are configured\\n- :math:`m_{rx}` the maximum packet size that the Wi-Fi driver can receive\\n- :math:`m_{tx}` the maximum packet size that the Wi-Fi driver can send\\n\\nSo, the peak memory that the Wi-Fi driver consumes (:math:`p`) can be calculated with the following formula:\\n\\n.. math::\\n\\n    p = (b_{rx} * m_{rx}) + (b_{tx} * m_{tx})\\n\\nGenerally, the dynamic TX long buffers and dynamic TX long long buffers can be ignored, because they are management frames which only have a small impact on the system.\\n\\n.. _How-to-improve-Wi-Fi-performance:\\n\\nHow to Improve Wi-Fi Performance\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nThe performance of {IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi is affected by many parameters, and there are mutual constraints between each parameter. A proper configuration cannot only improve performance, but also increase available memory for applications and improve stability.\\n\\nThis section briefly explains the operating mode of the Wi-Fi/LwIP protocol stack and the role of each parameter. It also gives several recommended configuration ranks to help choose the appropriate rank according to the usage scenario.\\n\\nProtocol Stack Operation Mode\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/api-guides-WiFi-driver-how-to-improve-WiFi-performance.png\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} datapath\\n\\nThe {IDF_TARGET_NAME} protocol stack is divided into four layers: Application, LwIP, Wi-Fi, and Hardware.\\n\\n - During receiving, hardware puts the received packet into DMA buffer, and then transfers it into the RX buffer of Wi-Fi and LwIP in turn for related protocol processing, and finally to the application layer. The Wi-Fi RX buffer and the LwIP RX buffer shares the same buffer by default. In other words, the Wi-Fi forwards the packet to LwIP by reference by default.\\n\\n - During sending, the application copies the messages to be sent into the TX buffer of the LwIP layer for TCP/IP encapsulation. The messages will then be passed to the TX buffer of the Wi-Fi layer for MAC encapsulation and wait to be sent.\\n\\nParameters\\n++++++++++++++\\n\\nIncreasing the size or number of the buffers mentioned above properly can improve Wi-Fi performance. Meanwhile, it will reduce available memory to the application. The following is an introduction to the parameters that users need to configure:\\n\\n**RX direction:**\\n\\n - :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_STATIC_RX_BUFFER_NUM`\\n    This parameter indicates the number of DMA buffer at the hardware layer. Increasing this parameter will increase the sender\\'s one-time receiving throughput, thereby improving the Wi-Fi protocol stack ability to handle burst traffic.\\n\\n - :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_DYNAMIC_RX_BUFFER_NUM`\\n    This parameter indicates the number of RX buffer in the Wi-Fi layer. Increasing this parameter will improve the performance of packet reception. This parameter needs to match the RX buffer size of the LwIP layer.\\n\\n - :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_RX_BA_WIN`\\n    This parameter indicates the size of the AMPDU BA Window at the receiving end. This parameter should be configured to the smaller value between twice of :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_STATIC_RX_BUFFER_NUM` and :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_DYNAMIC_RX_BUFFER_NUM`.\\n\\n - :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_TCP_WND_DEFAULT`\\n    This parameter represents the RX buffer size of the LwIP layer for each TCP stream. Its value should be configured to the value of WIFI_DYNAMIC_RX_BUFFER_NUM (KB) to reach a high and stable performance. Meanwhile, in case of multiple streams, this value needs to be reduced proportionally.\\n\\n**TX direction:**\\n\\n - :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_TX_BUFFER`\\n    This parameter indicates the type of TX buffer, it is recommended to configure it as a dynamic buffer, which can make full use of memory.\\n\\n - :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_DYNAMIC_TX_BUFFER_NUM`\\n    This parameter indicates the number of TX buffer on the Wi-Fi layer. Increasing this parameter will improve the performance of packet sending. The parameter value needs to match the TX buffer size of the LwIP layer.\\n\\n - :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_TCP_SND_BUF_DEFAULT`\\n    This parameter represents the TX buffer size of the LwIP layer for each TCP stream. Its value should be configured to the value of WIFI_DYNAMIC_TX_BUFFER_NUM (KB) to reach a high and stable performance. In case of multiple streams, this value needs to be reduced proportionally.\\n\\n**Throughput optimization by placing code in IRAM:**\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32s2\\n\\n    - :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_IRAM_OPT`\\n        If this option is enabled, some Wi-Fi functions are moved to IRAM, improving throughput.

It is initialized in :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_init()`\\xa0and freed in\\xa0:cpp:func:`esp_wifi_deinit()`. The ‘Static Rx Buffer’ forms the hardware receiving list. Upon receiving a frame over the air, hardware writes the frame into the buffer and raises an interrupt to the CPU. Then, the Wi-Fi driver reads the content from the buffer and returns the buffer back to the list.\\n\\n       If needs be, the application can reduce the memory statically allocated by Wi-Fi. It can reduce this value from 10 to 6 to save 6400 Bytes of memory. It is not recommended to reduce the configuration to a value less than 6 unless the AMPDU feature is disabled.\\n   * - Dynamic RX Buffer\\n     - Dynamic\\n     - 32\\n     - Yes\\n     - The buffer length is variable and it depends on the received frames’ length. When the Wi-Fi driver receives a frame from the ‘Hardware Rx Buffer’, the ‘Dynamic Rx Buffer’ needs to be allocated from the heap. The number of the Dynamic Rx Buffer, configured in the menuconfig, is used to limit the total un-freed Dynamic Rx Buffer number.\\n   * - Dynamic TX Buffer\\n     - Dynamic\\n     - 32\\n     - Yes\\n     - This is a kind of DMA memory. It is allocated to the heap.

For this reason, if PSRAM is enabled, the TX buffer must be static.\\n   * - Management Short Buffer\\n     - Dynamic\\n     - 8\\n     - NO\\n     - Wi-Fi driver’s internal buffer.\\n   * - Management Long Buffer\\n     - Dynamic\\n     - 32\\n     - NO\\n     - Wi-Fi driver’s internal buffer.\\n   * - Management Long Long Buffer\\n     - Dynamic\\n     - 32\\n     - NO\\n     - Wi-Fi driver’s internal buffer.\\n\\nWi-Fi NVS Flash\\n+++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nIf the Wi-Fi NVS flash is enabled, all Wi-Fi configurations set via the Wi-Fi APIs will be stored into flash, and the Wi-Fi driver will start up with these configurations the next time it powers on/reboots. However, the application can choose to disable the Wi-Fi NVS flash if it does not need to store the configurations into persistent memory, or has its own persistent storage, or simply due to debugging reasons, etc.\\n\\nWi-Fi Aggregate MAC Protocol Data Unit (AMPDU)\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports both receiving and transmitting AMPDU, and the AMPDU can greatly improve the Wi-Fi throughput.\\n\\nGenerally, the AMPDU should be enabled.

It consists of two layers: the Bluetooth Upper Layer (BTU) and the Bluetooth Transport Controller layer (BTC). The BTU layer is responsible for processing bottom layer Bluetooth protocols such as L2CAP, GATT/ATT, SMP, GAP, and other profiles. The BTU layer provides an interface prefixed with \"bta\". The BTC layer is mainly responsible for providing a supported interface, prefixed with \"esp\", to the application layer, processing GATT-based profiles and handling miscellaneous tasks.

It provides a secure protocol to pass Wi-Fi configuration and credentials to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. Using this information, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} can then connect to an AP or establish a SoftAP.\\n\\nFragmenting, data encryption, and checksum verification in the BluFi layer are the key elements of this process.\\n\\nYou can customize symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and checksum support customization. Here we use the DH algorithm for key negotiation, 128-AES algorithm for data encryption, and CRC16 algorithm for checksum verification.\\n\\nThe BluFi Flow\\n---------------\\n\\nThe BluFi networking flow includes the configuration of the SoftAP and Station.\\n\\nThe following uses Station as an example to illustrate the core parts of the procedure, including broadcast, connection, service discovery, negotiation of the shared key, data transmission, and connection status backhaul.\\n\\n1. Set the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} into GATT Server mode and then it will send broadcasts with specific *advertising data*. You can customize this broadcast as needed, which is not a part of the BluFi Profile.\\n\\n2. Use the App installed on the mobile phone to search for this particular broadcast. The mobile phone will connect to {IDF_TARGET_NAME} as the GATT Client once the broadcast is confirmed. The App used during this part is up to you.\\n\\n3. After the GATT connection is successfully established, the mobile phone will send a data frame for key negotiation to {IDF_TARGET_NAME} (see the section :ref:`frame_formats` for details).\\n\\n4. After {IDF_TARGET_NAME} receives the data frame of key negotiation, it will parse the content according to the user-defined negotiation method.\\n\\n5. The mobile phone works with {IDF_TARGET_NAME} for key negotiation using the encryption algorithms, such as DH, RSA, or ECC.\\n\\n6. After the negotiation process is completed, the mobile phone will send a control frame for security-mode setup to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.\\n\\n7. When receiving this control frame, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} will be able to encrypt and decrypt the communication data using the shared key and the security configuration.\\n\\n8. The mobile phone sends the data frame defined in the section of :ref:`frame_formats`,with the Wi-Fi configuration information to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, including SSID, password, etc.\\n\\n9. The mobile phone sends a control frame of Wi-Fi connection request to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. When receiving this control frame, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} will regard the communication of essential information as done and get ready to connect to the Wi-Fi.\\n\\n10. After connecting to the Wi-Fi, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} will send a control frame of Wi-Fi connection status report to the mobile phone. At this point, the networking procedure is completed.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    1.

CheckSum\\n\\n   The **CheckSum** field takes two bytes, which is used to check \"sequence + data length + clear text data\".\\n\\nThe Security Implementation of {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\n1. Securing Data\\n\\n   To ensure that the transmission of the Wi-Fi SSID and password is secure, the message needs to be encrypted using symmetric encryption algorithms, such as AES, DES, and so on. Before using symmetric encryption algorithms, the devices are required to negotiate (or generate) a shared key using an asymmetric encryption algorithm (DH, RSA, ECC, etc).\\n\\n2. Ensuring Data Integrity\\n\\n   To ensure data integrity, you need to add a checksum algorithm, such as SHA1, MD5, CRC, etc.\\n\\n3. Securing Identity (Signature)\\n\\n   Algorithm like RSA can be used to secure identity. But for DH, it needs other algorithms as an companion for signature.\\n\\n4. Replay Attack Prevention\\n\\n   It is added to the Sequence Number field and used during the checksum verification.\\n\\n   For the coding of {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, you can determine and develop the security processing, such as key negotiation. The mobile application sends the negotiation data to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, and then the data will be sent to the application layer for processing. If the application layer does not process it, you can use the DH encryption algorithm provided by BluFi to negotiate the key.\\n\\n   The application layer needs to register several security-related functions to BluFi:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n   typedef void (*esp_blufi_negotiate_data_handler_t)(uint8_t *data, int len, uint8_t **output_data, int *output_len, bool *need_free)\\n\\nThis function is for {IDF_TARGET_NAME} to receive normal data during negotiation. After processing is completed, the data will be transmitted using Output_data and Output_len.\\n\\nBluFi will send output_data from Negotiate_data_handler after Negotiate_data_handler is called.\\n\\nHere are two \"*\", which means the length of the data to be emitted is unknown. Therefore, it requires the function to allocate itself (malloc) or point to the global variable to inform whether the memory needs to be freed by NEED_FREE.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n   typedef int (* esp_blufi_encrypt_func_t)(uint8_t iv8, uint8_t *crypt_data, int crypt_len)\\n\\nThe data to be encrypted and decrypted must be in the same length. The IV8 is an 8-bit sequence value of frames, which can be used as a 8-bit of IV.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n   typedef int (* esp_blufi_decrypt_func_t)(uint8_t iv8, uint8_t *crypt_data, int crypt_len)\\n\\nThe data to be encrypted and decrypted must be in the same length. The IV8 is an 8-bit sequence value of frames, which can be used as an 8-bit of IV.\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n   typedef uint16_t (*esp_blufi_checksum_func_t)(uint8_t iv8, uint8_t *data, int len)\\n\\nThis function is used to compute CheckSum and return a value of CheckSum. BluFi uses the returned value to compare the CheckSum of the frame.\\n\\nGATT Related Instructions\\n-------------------------\\n\\nUUID\\n>>>>>\\n\\nBluFi Service UUID: 0xFFFF, 16 bit\\n\\nBluFi (the mobile > {IDF_TARGET_NAME}): 0xFF01, writable\\n\\nBlufi ({IDF_TARGET_NAME} > the mobile phone): 0xFF02, readable and callable\\n',\n",

SPI0 and SPI1 share a common SPI bus. The main Flash and PSRAM are connected to the MSPI peripheral. CPU accesses them via Cache.\\n\\n\\n.. _flash-psram-configuration:\\n\\nHow to Configure Flash and PSRAM\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n``idf.py menuconfig`` is used to open the configuration menu.\\n\\nConfigure the Flash\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe Flash related configurations are under ``Serial flasher config`` menu.\\n\\n1. Flash type used on the board. For Octal Flash, select :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_OCT_FLASH`. For Quad Flash, uncheck this configuration.\\n2. Flash line mode. Select a line mode in :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHMODE`. The higher the line mode is, the faster the SPI speed is. See terminology above about the line mode.\\n3. Flash sample mode. Select a sample mode in :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASH_SAMPLE_MODE`. DDR mode is faster than SDR mode. See terminology above about SDR and DDR mode.\\n4. Flash speed. Select a Flash frequency in :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHFREQ`.\\n5. Flash size. Flash size, in megabytes. Select a Flash size in :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE`.\\n\\nConfigure the PSRAM\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTo enable PSRAM, please enable the :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM` under ``Component config / Hardware Settings`` menu. Then all the PSRAM related configurations will be visible under ``SPI RAM config`` menu.\\n\\n1. PSRAM type used on the board. Select a type in :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_MODE` for Quad or Octal PSRAM.\\n2. PSRAM speed. Select a PSRAM frequency in :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_SPEED`.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Configuration 1 of Flash and PSRAM should be selected according to your actual hardware.\\n\\n    For the reset of the above configurations:\\n\\n    - Flash and PSRAM share the same internal clock.\\n    - Quad Flash only supports STR mode. Octal Flash may support either/both STR/DTR modes under OPI mode, depending on the flash model and the vendor.\\n    - Quad PSRAM only supports STR mode, while Octal PSRAM only supports DTR mode.\\n\\n    Therefore, some limitations should be noticed when configuring configuration 2, 3 and 4 of Flash, and configuration 2 of PSRAM. Please refer to :ref:`All Supported Modes and Speeds <flash-psram-combination>`\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    If a board with Octal Flash resets before the second-stage bootloader, please refer to :ref:`Error Handling Chapter <flash-psram-error>`\\n\\n\\n.. _flash-psram-combination:\\n\\nAll Supported Modes and Speeds\\n------------------------------\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    For MSPI DDR mode, the data are sampled on both the positive edge and the negative edge. e.g., if a Flash is set to 80 MHz and DDR mode, then the final speed of the Flash is 160 MHz. This is faster than the Flash setting to 120 Mhz and STR mode.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n    120 MHz DDR mode is an experimental feature. You will only see it when:\\n\\n    - :ref:`CONFIG_IDF_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURES` is enabled\\n\\n    With above step, you will find 120 MHz option is visible.\\n\\n    Risks:\\n\\n    If your chip powers on at a certain temperature, then after the temperature increases or decreases over 20 celsius degree, the accesses to/from PSRAM/Flash will crash randomly. Flash access crash will lead to program crash.\\n\\n    Note 20 celsius degree is not a totally correct number.

Policy\\n------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCoexistence Mechanism\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe RF resource allocation mechanism is based on priority. As shown below, both Bluetooth module and Wi-Fi module request RF resources from the coexistence module, and the coexistence module decides who will use the RF resource based on their priority.\\n\\n.. blockdiag::\\n    :scale: 100%\\n    :caption: Coexistence Mechanism\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    blockdiag {\\n\\n      # global attributes\\n      node_height = 60;\\n      node_width = 120;\\n      span_width = 100;\\n      span_height = 60;\\n      default_shape = roundedbox;\\n      default_group_color = none;\\n\\n      # node labels\\n       Wi-Fi [shape = box];\\n       Bluetooth [shape = box];\\n       Coexistence [shape = box, label = \\'Coexistence module\\'];\\n       RF [shape = box, label = \\'RF module\\'];\\n\\n      # node connections\\n       Wi-Fi -> Coexistence;\\n       Bluetooth  -> Coexistence;\\n       Coexistence -> RF;\\n    }\\n\\n\\n.. _coexist_policy:\\n\\nCoexistence Policy\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nCoexistence Period and Time Slice\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n  Wi-Fi, BT, and BLE have their fixed time slice to use the RF. A coexistence period is divided into 3 time slices in the order of Wi-Fi, BT, and BLE. In the Wi-Fi slice, Wi-Fi\\'s request to the coexistence arbitration module will have higher priority. Similarly, BT/BLE can enjoy higher priority at their own time slices. The duration of the coexistence period and the proportion of each time slice are divided into four categories according to the Wi-Fi status:\\n\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED and SOC_BLE_SUPPORTED and not esp32\\n\\n  Wi-Fi and BLE have their fixed time slice to use the RF. In the Wi-Fi time slice, Wi-Fi will send a higher priority request to the coexistence arbitration module. Similarly, BLE can enjoy higher priority at their own time slice. The duration of the coexistence period and the proportion of each time slice are divided into four categories according to the Wi-Fi status:\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_IEEE802154_SUPPORTED\\n\\n  Currently, the only supported strategy ensures that the priority of BLE always takes precedence over IEEE802.15.4.\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n  :esp32: 1) IDLE status: the coexistence of BT and BLE is controlled by Bluetooth module.\\n  :SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED and SOC_BLE_SUPPORTED and not esp32: 1) IDLE status: RF module is controlled by Bluetooth module.\\n  #) CONNECTED status: the coexistence period starts at the Target Beacon Transmission Time (TBTT) and is more than 100 ms.\\n  #) SCAN status: Wi-Fi slice and coexistence period are longer than in the CONNECTED status. To ensure Bluetooth performance, the Bluetooth time slice will also be adjusted accordingly.\\n  #) CONNECTING status: Wi-Fi slice is longer than in the CONNECTED status. To ensure Bluetooth performance, the Bluetooth time slice will also be adjusted accordingly.\\n\\n\\nAccording to the coexistence logic, different coexistence periods and time slice strategies will be selected based on the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth usage scenarios. A Coexistence policy corresponding to a certain usage scenarios is called a \"coexistence scheme\". For example, the scenario of Wi-Fi CONNECTED and BLE CONNECTED has a corresponding coexistence scheme. In this scheme, the time slices of Wi-Fi and BLE in a coexistence period each account for 50%. The time allocation is shown in the following figure:\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/coexist_wifi_connected_and_ble_connected_time_slice.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Time Slice Under the Status of Wi-Fi CONNECTED and BLE CONNECTED\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Time Slice Under the Status of Wi-Fi CONNECTED and BLE CONNECTED\\n\\n\\nDynamic Priority\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nThe coexistence module assigns varying priorities to different statuses of each module, and these priorities are dynamic. For example, in every N BLE Advertising events, there is always one event with high priority. If a high-priority BLE Advertising event occurs within the Wi-Fi time slice, the right to use the RF may be preempted by BLE.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Wi-Fi Connectionless Modules Coexistence\\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\n    To some extent, some combinations of connectionless power-saving parameters `Window` and `Interval` would lead to extra Wi-Fi priority request out of Wi-Fi time slice. It`s for obtaining RF resources at coexistence for customized parameters, while leading to impact on Bluetooth performance.\\n\\n    If connectionless power-saving parameters are configured with default values, the coexistence module would perform in stable mode and the behaviour above would not happen. So please configure Wi-Fi connectionless power-saving parameters to default values unless you have plenty of coexistence performance tests for customized parameters.\\n\\n    Please refer to :ref:`connectionless module power save <connectionless-module-power-save>` to get more detail.\\n\\n\\nHow to Use the Coexistence Feature\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nCoexistence API\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFor most coexistence cases, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} will switch the coexistence status automatically without calling API. However, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} provides two APIs for the coexistence of BLE MESH and Wi-Fi. When the status of BLE MESH changes, call :code:`esp_coex_status_bit_clear` to clear the previous status first and then call :code:`esp_coex_status_bit_set` to set the current status.\\n\\n\\nBLE MESH Coexistence Status\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nAs the firmware of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are not aware of the current scenario of the upper layer application, some coexistence schemes require application code to call the coexistence API to take effect. The application layer needs to pass the working status of BLE MESH to the coexistence module for selecting the coexistence scheme.\\n\\n  - ESP_COEX_BLE_ST_MESH_CONFIG: network is provisioning\\n  - ESP_COEX_BLE_ST_MESH_TRAFFIC: data is transmitting\\n  - ESP_COEX_BLE_ST_MESH_STANDBY: in idle status with no significant data interaction\\n\\n\\nCoexistence API Error Codes\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAll coexistence APIs have custom return values, i.e., error codes. These error codes can be categorized as:\\n\\n  - No error. For example, the return value ESP_OK siginifies the API returned successfully.\\n  - Recoverable errors. For example, the return value ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG signifies API parameter errors.\\n\\n\\nSetting Coexistence Compile-time Options\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n  - After writing the coexistence program, you must check  :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_COEX_SW_COEXIST_ENABLE` option through menuconfig to open coexistence configuration on software, otherwise the coexistence function mentioned above cannot be used.\\n  :esp32: - To ensure better communication performance of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in the case of coexistence, run the task of the Wi-Fi protocol stack, the task of the Bluetooth Controller and Host protocol stack on different CPUs.

However, on ESP chips that contain a USB Serial/JTAG Controller, the CDC-ACM portion of the controller implements a serial port that is connected directly to a host/PC, thus does not require an external USB-UART bridge chip.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} contains a USB Serial/JTAG Controller providing the following functions:\\n\\n* Bidirectional serial console, which can be used with :doc:`IDF Monitor <tools/idf-monitor>` or another serial monitor.\\n* Flashing using ``esptool.py`` and ``idf.py flash``.\\n* JTAG debugging, performed simultaneously with serial operations using tools like OpenOCD.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  The USB Serial/JTAG Controller is a fixed-function USB device that is implemented entirely in hardware, meaning that it cannot be reconfigured to perform any function other than a serial port and JTAG debugging functionality. This is in contrast to the USB OTG controllers in some ESP chips that can be configured to perform the function of multiple types of USB devices.\\n\\nHardware Requirements\\n=====================\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_USB_DP_GPIO:default=\"Not Updated!\",esp32c3=\"19\",esp32s3=\"20\", esp32c6=\"13\", esp32h2=\"27\"}\\n{IDF_TARGET_USB_DM_GPIO:default=\"Not Updated!\",esp32c3=\"18\",esp32s3=\"19\", esp32c6=\"12\", esp32h2=\"26\"}\\n\\nConnect {IDF_TARGET_NAME} to the USB port as follows:\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n    :widths: 40 60\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    * - GPIO\\n      - USB\\n    * - {IDF_TARGET_USB_DP_GPIO}\\n      - D+ (green)\\n    * - {IDF_TARGET_USB_DM_GPIO}\\n      - D- (white)\\n    * - GND\\n      - GND (black)\\n    * - 5V (or externally supplied)\\n      - +5V (red)\\n\\nSome development boards may offer a USB connector for the USB Serial/JTAG Controller. In that case, no extra connections are required.\\n\\nSoftware Configuration\\n======================\\n\\nThe USB Serial/JTAG Controller can be used as the serial port by selecting ``CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_USB_SERIAL_JTAG`` in the :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_UART` option. Once selected, building and flashing the project can occur as usual.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can access the output through the ``usb_serial_jtag`` port but make sure ``CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_SECONDARY_USB_SERIAL_JTAG`` is selected in the :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_SECONDARY`.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    Besides output, if you also want to input or use REPL with the console, please select ``CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_USB_SERIAL_JTAG``.\\n\\nUploading the Application\\n=========================\\n\\nThe USB Serial/JTAG Controller is able to put the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} into download mode automatically. Simply flash as usual, but specify the USB Serial/JTAG Controller port on your system: ``idf.py flash -p PORT``, where ``PORT`` is the name of the proper port.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The USB Serial/JTAG Controller\\'s serial port usually appears:\\n\\n    - as ``/dev/ttyACM*`` on Linux\\n    - as ``/dev/cu*`` on Mac\\n    - as a ``COM*`` port in the Windows Device Manager\\n\\nLimitations\\n===========\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_BOOT_PIN:default = \"Not Updated!\", esp32c3 = \"GPIO9\", esp32s3 = \"GPIO0\", esp32c6 = \"GPIO9\"}\\n\\nThere are several limitations to the USB Serial/JTAG console feature. The significance of these limitations depends on the type of application being developed, and the development workflow.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_BOOT_PIN:default = \"Not Updated!\", esp32c3 = \"GPIO9\", esp32s3 = \"GPIO0\", esp32c6 = \"GPIO9\"}\\n\\nUSB Pin Reconfiguration\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIf the application accidentally reconfigures the USB peripheral pins or disables the USB Serial/JTAG Controller, the device disappears from the system. After fixing the issue in the application, you need to manually put the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} into download mode by pulling low {IDF_TARGET_BOOT_PIN} and resetting the chip.\\n\\nIf the application enters Deep-sleep mode, the USB Serial/JTAG device disappears from the system.\\n\\nData Buffering\\n--------------\\n\\nFor data transmitted from {IDF_TARGET_NAME} to PC Terminal (e.g., stdout, logs), the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} first writes to a small internal buffer. After this buffer becomes full (for example, if no PC Terminal is connected), the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} does a one-time wait of 50 ms for the PC Terminal to request the data. This can appear as a very brief pause in your application.\\n\\nFor data transmitted from the PC Terminal to {IDF_TARGET_NAME} (e.g., console commands), many PC Terminals wait for the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} to ingest the bytes before allowing you to send more data. This is in contrast to using a USB-to-Serial (UART) bridge chip, which always ingests the bytes and sends them to a (possibly not listening) {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    In rare cases, it is possible that data sent from {IDF_TARGET_NAME} to the host gets \\'stuck\\' in host memory. Sending more data will get it \\'unstuck\\', but if the application does not send more data, depending on the driver, this data needs to be flushed to the host manually. The non-blocking (default) driver and the VFS implementation will flush automatically after a newline. The blocking (interrupt-based) driver will automatically flush when its transmit buffer becomes empty.\\n\\nSleep Mode Considerations\\n-------------------------\\n\\nThe USB Serial/JTAG controller and its associated USB PHY are driven by particular clocks (e.g., APB and USB PHY clock) and belong to a particular power domain (e.g., digital power domain). Thus, any change to the clock and power domains associated with the USB Serial/JTAG controller, such as entering different sleep modes, can affect the controller\\'s operation.\\n\\nDeep-sleep\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen entering Deep-sleep, both the USB Serial/JTAG controller and the USB PHY are powered off, leading to the USB PHY\\'s D+ line no longer being pulled up. As a result:\\n\\n- When entering Deep-sleep, the USB Serial/JTAG device appears disconnected from the host/PC (even if the USB cable is still physically connected).\\n- When exiting Deep-sleep, the USB Serial/JTAG device reconnects to the host/PC.\\n\\nLight-sleep\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_USB_SERIAL_JTAG_SUPPORT_LIGHT_SLEEP\\n\\nWhen entering Light-sleep, the APB and USB PHY clock are gated. Thus, the USB Serial/JTAG controller is no longer able to receive or respond to any USB transactions from the connected host (including periodic CDC Data IN transactions). As a result:\\n\\n- when entering Light-sleep, the USB Serial/JTAG device is unresponsive to the host/PC\\'s USB CDC driver. The host/PC may then report the USB Serial/JTAG device as disconnected or erroneous (even if the USB cable is still physically connected).\\n- when exiting Light-sleep, it is possible that the host/PC does not re-enumerate (i.e., reconnect) the USB Serial/JTAG device given that the USB PHY\\'s D+ line remains pulled up state during Light-sleep. Users may need to physically disconnect and then reconnect the USB cable.\\n\\nAutomatic and Manual Sleep Entry\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf users enter sleep manually (via :cpp:func:`esp_light_sleep_start` or :cpp:func:`esp_deep_sleep_start`), users should be cognizant of the fact that USB Serial/JTAG controller does not work during sleep. ESP-IDF **does not add any safety check to reject entry to sleep** even if the USB Serial/JTAG controller is connected. In the case where sleep is entered while the USB Serial/JTAG controller is connected, the connection can be re-established by unplugging and re-plugging the USB cable.\\n\\nIf users enter sleep automatically (via :cpp:func:`esp_pm_configure`), enabling the :ref:`CONFIG_USJ_NO_AUTO_LS_ON_CONNECTION` option allows the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} to automatically detect whether the USB Serial/JTAG controller is currently connected to a host, and prevent automatic entry to sleep as long as the connection persists. However, note that this option increases power consumption.\\n',\n",
       " 'Reproducible Builds\\n===================\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\nESP-IDF build system has support for `reproducible builds`_.\\n\\nWhen reproducible builds are enabled, the application built with ESP-IDF does not depend on the build environment. Both the .elf file and .bin files of the application remains exactly the same, even if the following variables change:\\n\\n- Directory where the project is located\\n- Directory where ESP-IDF is located (``IDF_PATH``)\\n- Build time\\n\\nReasons for Non-Reproducible Builds\\n-----------------------------------\\n\\nThere are several reasons why an application may depend on the build environment, even when the same source code and tools versions are used.\\n\\n- In C code, ``__FILE__`` preprocessor macro is expanded to the full path of the source file.\\n- ``__DATE__`` and ``__TIME__`` preprocessor macros are expanded to compilation date and time.\\n- When the compiler generates object files, it adds sections with debug information. These sections help debuggers, like GDB, to locate the source code which corresponds to a particular location in the machine code. These sections typically contain paths of relevant source files. These paths may be absolute, and will include the path to ESP-IDF or to the project.\\n\\nThere are also other possible reasons, such as unstable order of inputs and non-determinism in the build system.\\n\\nEnabling Reproducible Builds in ESP-IDF\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nReproducible builds can be enabled in ESP-IDF using :ref:`CONFIG_APP_REPRODUCIBLE_BUILD` option.\\n\\nThis option is disabled by default. It can be enabled in ``menuconfig``.\\n\\nThe option may also be added into ``sdkconfig.defaults``. If adding the option into ``sdkconfig.defaults``, delete the ``sdkconfig`` file and run the build again. See :ref:`custom-sdkconfig-defaults` for more information.\\n\\nHow Reproducible Builds Are Achieved\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nESP-IDF achieves reproducible builds using the following measures:\\n\\n- In ESP-IDF source code, ``__DATE__`` and ``__TIME__`` macros are not used when reproducible builds are enabled. Note, if the application source code uses these macros, the build will not be reproducible.\\n- ESP-IDF build system passes a set of ``-fmacro-prefix-map`` and ``-fdebug-prefix-map`` flags to replace base paths with placeholders:\\n\\n    - Path to ESP-IDF is replaced with ``/IDF``\\n    - Path to the project is replaced with ``/IDF_PROJECT``\\n    - Path to the build directory is replaced with ``/IDF_BUILD``\\n    - Paths to components are replaced with ``/COMPONENT_NAME_DIR`` (where ``NAME`` is the name of the component)\\n\\n- Build date and time are not included into the :ref:`application  metadata structure <app-image-format-application-description>` and :ref:`bootloader metadata structure <image-format-bootloader-description>` if :ref:`CONFIG_APP_REPRODUCIBLE_BUILD` is enabled.\\n- ESP-IDF build system ensures that source file lists, component lists and other sequences are sorted before passing them to CMake. Various other parts of the build system, such as the linker script generator also perform sorting to ensure that same output is produced regardless of the environment.\\n\\nReproducible Builds and Debugging\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nWhen reproducible builds are enabled, file names included in debug information sections are altered as shown in the previous section. Due to this fact, the debugger (GDB) is not able to locate the source files for the given code location.\\n\\nThis issue can be solved using GDB ``set substitute-path`` command. For example, by adding the following command to GDB init script, the altered paths can be reverted to the original ones::\\n\\n    set substitute-path /COMPONENT_FREERTOS_DIR /home/user/esp/esp-idf/components/freertos\\n\\nESP-IDF build system generates a file with the list of such ``set substitute-path`` commands automatically during the build process. The file is called ``prefix_map_gdbinit`` and is located in the project ``build`` directory.\\n\\nWhen :ref:`idf.py gdb <jtag-debugging-with-idf-py>` is used to start debugging, this additional gdbinit file is automatically passed to GDB. When launching GDB manually or from and IDE, please pass this additional gdbinit script to GDB using ``-x build/prefix_map_gdbinit`` argument.\\n\\nFactors Which Still Affect Reproducible Builds\\n----------------------------------------------\\n\\nNote that the built application still depends on:\\n\\n- ESP-IDF version\\n- Versions of the build tools (CMake, Ninja) and the cross-compiler\\n\\n:doc:`tools/idf-docker-image` can be used to ensure that these factors do not affect the build.\\n\\n\\n.. _reproducible builds: https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/definition/\\n',\n",
       " 'Linker Script Generation\\n========================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nThere are several :ref:`memory regions <memory-layout>` where code and data can be placed. Code and read-only data are placed by default in flash, writable data in RAM, etc. However, it is sometimes necessary to change these default placements.\\n\\nFor example, it may be necessary to place:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    * critical code in RAM for performance reasons.\\n    * executable code in IRAM so that it can be ran while cache is disabled.\\n    :SOC_RTC_MEM_SUPPORTED: * code in RTC memory for use in a wake stub.\\n    :SOC_ULP_SUPPORTED: * code in RTC memory for use by the ULP coprocessor.\\n\\nWith the linker script generation mechanism, it is possible to specify these placements at the component level within ESP-IDF. The component presents information on how it would like to place its symbols, objects or the entire archive. During build, the information presented by the components are collected, parsed and processed; and the placement rules generated is used to link the app.\\n\\nQuick Start\\n------------\\n\\nThis section presents a guide for quickly placing code/data to RAM and RTC memory - placements ESP-IDF provides out-of-the-box.\\n\\nFor this guide, suppose we have the following::\\n\\n    components\\n    └── my_component\\n        ├── CMakeLists.txt\\n        ├── Kconfig\\n        ├── src/\\n        │   ├── my_src1.c\\n        │   ├── my_src2.c\\n        │   └── my_src3.c\\n        └── my_linker_fragment_file.lf\\n\\n- a component named ``my_component`` that is archived as library ``libmy_component.a`` during build\\n- three source files archived under the library, ``my_src1.c``, ``my_src2.c`` and ``my_src3.c`` which are compiled as ``my_src1.o``, ``my_src2.o`` and ``my_src3.o``, respectively\\n- under ``my_src1.o``, the function ``my_function1`` is defined; under ``my_src2.o``, the function ``my_function2`` is defined\\n- there is bool-type config ``PERFORMANCE_MODE`` (y/n) and int type config ``PERFORMANCE_LEVEL`` (with range 0-3) in ``my_component``\\'s Kconfig\\n\\nCreating and Specifying a Linker Fragment File\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBefore anything else, a linker fragment file needs to be created. A linker fragment file is simply a text file with a ``.lf`` extension upon which the desired placements will be written. After creating the file, it is then necessary to present it to the build system. The instructions for the build systems supported by ESP-IDF are as follows:\\n\\nIn the component\\'s ``CMakeLists.txt`` file, specify argument ``LDFRAGMENTS`` in the ``idf_component_register`` call. The value of ``LDFRAGMENTS`` can either be an absolute path or a relative path from the component directory to the created linker fragment file.\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n    # file paths relative to CMakeLists.txt\\n    idf_component_register(...\\n                           LDFRAGMENTS \"path/to/linker_fragment_file.lf\" \"path/to/another_linker_fragment_file.lf\"\\n                           ...\\n                           )\\n\\n\\nSpecifying Placements\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIt is possible to specify placements at the following levels of granularity:\\n\\n    - object file (``.obj`` or ``.o`` files)\\n    - symbol (function/variable)\\n    - archive (``.a`` files)\\n\\n.. _ldgen-placing-object-files :\\n\\nPlacing Object Files\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nSuppose the entirety of ``my_src1.o`` is performance-critical, so it is desirable to place it in RAM. On the other hand, the entirety of ``my_src2.o`` contains symbols needed coming out of deep sleep, so it needs to be put under RTC memory.\\n\\nIn the linker fragment file, we can write:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    [mapping:my_component]\\n    archive: libmy_component.a\\n    entries:\\n        my_src1 (noflash)     # places all my_src1 code/read-only data under IRAM/DRAM\\n        my_src2 (rtc)         # places all my_src2 code/ data and read-only data under RTC fast memory/RTC slow memory\\n\\nWhat happens to ``my_src3.o``? Since it is not specified, default placements are used for ``my_src3.o``. More on default placements :ref:`here <ldgen-default-placements>`.\\n\\nPlacing Symbols\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nContinuing our example, suppose that among functions defined under ``object1.o``, only ``my_function1`` is performance-critical; and under ``object2.o``, only ``my_function2`` needs to execute after the chip comes out of deep sleep. This could be accomplished by writing:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    [mapping:my_component]\\n    archive: libmy_component.a\\n    entries:\\n        my_src1:my_function1 (noflash)\\n        my_src2:my_function2 (rtc)\\n\\nThe default placements are used for the rest of the functions in ``my_src1.o`` and ``my_src2.o`` and the entire ``object3.o``. Something similar can be achieved for placing data by writing the variable name instead of the function name, like so::\\n\\n       my_src1:my_variable (noflash)\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    There are :ref:`limitations<ldgen-symbol-granularity-placements>` in placing code/data at symbol granularity. In order to ensure proper placements, an alternative would be to group relevant code and data into source files, and :ref:`use object-granularity placements<ldgen-placing-object-files>`.\\n\\nPlacing Entire Archive\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nIn this example, suppose that the entire component archive needs to be placed in RAM. This can be written as:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    [mapping:my_component]\\n    archive: libmy_component.a\\n    entries:\\n        * (noflash)\\n\\nSimilarly, this places the entire component in RTC memory:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    [mapping:my_component]\\n    archive: libmy_component.a\\n    entries:\\n        * (rtc)\\n\\n\\n.. _ldgen-conditional-placements:\\n\\nConfiguration-Dependent Placements\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nSuppose that the entire component library should only have special placement when a certain condition is true; for example, when ``CONFIG_PERFORMANCE_MODE == y``. This could be written as:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    [mapping:my_component]\\n    archive: libmy_component.a\\n    entries:\\n        if PERFORMANCE_MODE = y:\\n            * (noflash)\\n        else:\\n            * (default)\\n\\nFor a more complex config-dependent placement, suppose the following requirements: when ``CONFIG_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL == 1``, only ``object1.o`` is put in RAM; when ``CONFIG_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL == 2``, ``object1.o`` and ``object2.o``; and when ``CONFIG_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL == 3`` all object files under the archive are to be put into RAM. When these three are false however, put entire library in RTC memory. This scenario is a bit contrived, but, it can be written as:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    [mapping:my_component]\\n    archive: libmy_component.a\\n    entries:\\n        if PERFORMANCE_LEVEL = 1:\\n            my_src1 (noflash)\\n        elif PERFORMANCE_LEVEL = 2:\\n            my_src1 (noflash)\\n            my_src2 (noflash)\\n        elif PERFORMANCE_LEVEL = 3:\\n            my_src1 (noflash)\\n            my_src2 (noflash)\\n            my_src3 (noflash)\\n        else:\\n            * (rtc)\\n\\nNesting condition-checking is also possible. The following is equivalent to the snippet above:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    [mapping:my_component]\\n    archive: libmy_component.a\\n    entries:\\n        if PERFORMANCE_LEVEL <= 3 && PERFORMANCE_LEVEL > 0:\\n            if PERFORMANCE_LEVEL >= 1:\\n                object1 (noflash)\\n                if PERFORMANCE_LEVEL >= 2:\\n                    object2 (noflash)\\n                    if PERFORMANCE_LEVEL >= 3:\\n                        object2 (noflash)\\n        else:\\n            * (rtc)\\n\\n.. _ldgen-default-placements:\\n\\nThe \\'default\\' Placements\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nUp until this point, the term  \\'default placements\\' has been mentioned as fallback placements when the placement rules ``rtc`` and ``noflash`` are not specified. It is important to note that the tokens ``noflash`` or ``rtc`` are not merely keywords, but are actually entities called fragments, specifically :ref:`schemes <ldgen-scheme-fragment>`.\\n\\nIn the same manner as ``rtc`` and ``noflash`` are schemes, there exists a ``default`` scheme which defines what the default placement rules should be. As the name suggests, it is where code and data are usually placed, i.e., code/constants is placed in flash, variables placed in RAM, etc.  More on the default scheme :ref:`here <ldgen-default-scheme>`.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    For an example of an ESP-IDF component using the linker script generation mechanism, see :component_file:`freertos/CMakeLists.txt`. ``freertos`` uses this to place its object files to the instruction RAM for performance reasons.\\n\\nThis marks the end of the quick start guide. The following text discusses the internals of the mechanism in a little bit more detail. The following sections should be helpful in creating custom placements or modifying default behavior.\\n\\nLinker Script Generation Internals\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nLinking is the last step in the process of turning C/C++ source files into an executable. It is performed by the toolchain\\'s linker, and accepts linker scripts which specify code/data placements, among other things. With the linker script generation mechanism, this process is no different, except that the linker script passed to the linker is dynamically generated from: (1) the collected :ref:`linker fragment files <ldgen-linker-fragment-files>` and (2) :ref:`linker script template <ldgen-linker-script-template>`.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The tool that implements the linker script generation mechanism lives under :idf:`tools/ldgen`.\\n\\n.. _ldgen-linker-fragment-files :\\n\\nLinker Fragment Files\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAs mentioned in the quick start guide, fragment files are simple text files with the ``.lf`` extension containing the desired placements. This is a simplified description of what fragment files contain, however. What fragment files actually contain are \\'fragments\\'. Fragments are entities which contain pieces of information which, when put together, form placement rules that tell where to place sections of object files in the output binary. There are three types of fragments: :ref:`sections <ldgen-sections-fragment>`, :ref:`scheme <ldgen-scheme-fragment>` and :ref:`mapping <ldgen-mapping-fragment>`.\\n\\nGrammar\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nThe three fragment types share a common grammar:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    [type:name]\\n    key: value\\n    key:\\n        value\\n        value\\n        value\\n        ...\\n\\n- type: Corresponds to the fragment type, can either be ``sections``, ``scheme`` or ``mapping``.\\n- name: The name of the fragment, should be unique for the specified fragment type.\\n- key, value: Contents of the fragment; each fragment type may support different keys and different grammars for the key values.\\n\\n    - For :ref:`sections <ldgen-sections-fragment>` and :ref:`scheme <ldgen-scheme-fragment>`, the only supported key is ``entries``\\n    - For :ref:`mappings <ldgen-mapping-fragment>`, both ``archive`` and ``entries`` are supported.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    In cases where multiple fragments of the same type and name are encountered, an exception is thrown.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The only valid characters for fragment names and keys are alphanumeric characters and underscore.\\n\\n.. _ldgen-condition-checking :\\n\\n**Condition Checking**\\n\\nCondition checking enable the linker script generation to be configuration-aware. Depending on whether expressions involving configuration values are true or not, a particular set of values for a key can be used. The evaluation uses ``eval_string`` from kconfiglib package and adheres to its required syntax and limitations. Supported operators are as follows:\\n\\n    - comparison\\n        - LessThan ``<``\\n        - LessThanOrEqualTo ``<=``\\n        - MoreThan ``>``\\n        - MoreThanOrEqualTo ``>=``\\n        - Equal ``=``\\n        - NotEqual ``!=``\\n    - logical\\n        - Or ``||``\\n        - And ``&&``\\n        - Negation ``!``\\n    - grouping\\n        - Parenthesis ``()``\\n\\nCondition checking behaves as you would expect an ``if...elseif/elif...else`` block in other languages. Condition-checking is possible for both key values and entire fragments. The two sample fragments below are equivalent:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    # Value for keys is dependent on config\\n    [type:name]\\n    key_1:\\n        if CONDITION = y:\\n            value_1\\n        else:\\n            value_2\\n    key_2:\\n        if CONDITION = y:\\n            value_a\\n        else:\\n            value_b\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    # Entire fragment definition is dependent on config\\n    if CONDITION = y:\\n        [type:name]\\n        key_1:\\n            value_1\\n        key_2:\\n            value_a\\n    else:\\n        [type:name]\\n        key_1:\\n            value_2\\n        key_2:\\n            value_b\\n\\n**Comments**\\n\\nComment in linker fragment files begin with ``#``.

The symbol name can be a function name or a variable name.\\n    - object: Only the object file name is specified.\\n    - archive: ``*`` is specified, which is a short-hand for all the object files under the archive.\\n\\nTo know what an entry means, let us expand a sample object-granularity placement:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    object (scheme)\\n\\nThen expanding the scheme fragment from its entries definitions, we have:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    object (sections -> target,\\n            sections -> target,\\n            ...)\\n\\nExpanding the sections fragment with its entries definition:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    object (.section,      # given this object file\\n            .section,      # put its sections listed here at this\\n            ... -> target, # target\\n\\n            .section,\\n            .section,      # same should be done for these sections\\n            ... -> target,\\n\\n            ...)           # and so on\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    [mapping:map]\\n    archive: libfreertos.a\\n    entries:\\n        * (noflash)\\n\\nAside from the entity and scheme, flags can also be specified in an entry. The following flags are supported (note: <> = argument name, [] = optional):\\n\\n1. ALIGN(<alignment>[, pre, post])\\n\\n    Align the placement by the amount specified in ``alignment``. Generates\\n\\n.. code-block::none\\n\\n    . = ALIGN(<alignment>)\\n\\n    before and/or after (depending whether ``pre``, ``post`` or both are specified) the input section description generated from the mapping fragment entry. If neither \\'pre\\' or \\'post\\' is specified, the alignment command is generated before the input section description. Order sensitive.\\n\\n2. SORT([<sort_by_first>, <sort_by_second>])\\n\\n    Emits ``SORT_BY_NAME``, ``SORT_BY_ALIGNMENT``, ``SORT_BY_INIT_PRIORITY`` or ``SORT`` in the input section description.\\n\\n    Possible values for ``sort_by_first`` and ``sort_by_second`` are: ``name``, ``alignment``, ``init_priority``.\\n\\n    If both ``sort_by_first`` and ``sort_by_second`` are not specified, the input sections are sorted by name. If both are specified, then the nested sorting follows the same rules discussed in https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Input-Section-Wildcards.html.\\n\\n3. KEEP()\\n\\n    Prevent the linker from discarding the placement by surrounding the input section description with KEEP command. See https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Input-Section-Keep.html for more details.\\n\\n4.SURROUND(<name>)\\n\\n    Generate symbols before and after the placement. The generated symbols follow the naming ``_<name>_start`` and ``_<name>_end``. For example, if ``name`` == sym1,\\n\\n.. code-block::none\\n\\n    _sym1_start = ABSOLUTE(.)\\n    ...\\n    _sym2_end = ABSOLUTE(.)\\n\\n    These symbols can then be referenced from C/C++ code. Order sensitive.\\n\\nWhen adding flags, the specific ``section -> target`` in the scheme needs to be specified. For multiple ``section -> target``, use a comma as a separator. For example,\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    # Notes:\\n    # A. semicolon after entity-scheme\\n    # B. comma before section2 -> target2\\n    # C. section1 -> target1 and section2 -> target2 should be defined in entries of scheme1\\n    entity1 (scheme1);\\n        section1 -> target1 KEEP() ALIGN(4, pre, post),\\n        section2 -> target2 SURROUND(sym) ALIGN(4, post) SORT()\\n\\nPutting it all together, the following mapping fragment, for example,\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    [mapping:name]\\n    archive: lib1.a\\n    entries:\\n        obj1 (noflash);\\n            rodata -> dram0_data KEEP() SORT() ALIGN(8) SURROUND(my_sym)\\n\\ngenerates an output on the linker script:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    . = ALIGN(8)\\n    _my_sym_start = ABSOLUTE(.)\\n    KEEP(lib1.a:obj1.*( SORT(.rodata) SORT(.rodata.*) ))\\n    _my_sym_end = ABSOLUTE(.)\\n\\nNote that ALIGN and SURROUND, as mentioned in the flag descriptions, are order sensitive. Therefore, if for the same mapping fragment these two are switched, the following is generated instead:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    _my_sym_start = ABSOLUTE(.)\\n    . = ALIGN(8)\\n    KEEP(lib1.a:obj1.*( SORT(.rodata) SORT(.rodata.*) ))\\n    _my_sym_end = ABSOLUTE(.)\\n\\n.. _ldgen-symbol-granularity-placements :\\n\\nOn Symbol-Granularity Placements\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nSymbol granularity placements is possible due to compiler flags ``-ffunction-sections`` and ``-ffdata-sections``. ESP-IDF compiles with these flags by default.\\nIf the user opts to remove these flags, then the symbol-granularity placements will not work. Furthermore, even with the presence of these flags, there are still other limitations to keep in mind due to the dependence on the compiler\\'s emitted output sections.\\n\\nFor example, with ``-ffunction-sections``, separate sections are emitted for each function; with section names predictably constructed i.e., ``.text.{func_name}`` and ``.literal.{func_name}``. This is not the case for string literals within the function, as they go to pooled or generated section names.\\n\\nWith ``-fdata-sections``, for global scope data the compiler predictably emits either ``.data.{var_name}``, ``.rodata.{var_name}`` or ``.bss.{var_name}``; and so ``Type I`` mapping entry works for these.\\nHowever, this is not the case for static data declared in function scope, as the generated section name is a result of mangling the variable name with some other information.\\n\\n.. _ldgen-linker-script-template :\\n\\nLinker Script Template\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe linker script template is the skeleton in which the generated placement rules are put into. It is an otherwise ordinary linker script, with a specific marker syntax that indicates where the generated placement rules are placed.\\n\\nTo reference the placement rules collected under a ``target`` token, the following syntax is used:\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_MEM_NON_CONTIGUOUS_SRAM\\n\\n    .. code-block:: none\\n\\n        arrays[target]      /* refers to objects under the SURROUND keyword */\\n        mapping[target]     /* refers to all other data */\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_MEM_NON_CONTIGUOUS_SRAM\\n\\n    .. code-block:: none\\n\\n        mapping[target]\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nThe example below is an excerpt from a possible linker script template.

       " 'Application Level Tracing Library\\n=================================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nESP-IDF provides a useful feature for program behavior analysis: application level tracing. It is implemented in the corresponding library and can be enabled in menuconfig. This feature allows to transfer arbitrary data between host and {IDF_TARGET_NAME} via JTAG, UART, or USB interfaces with small overhead on program execution. It is possible to use JTAG and UART interfaces simultaneously. The UART interface is mostly used for connection with SEGGER SystemView tool (see `SystemView <https://www.segger.com/products/development-tools/systemview/>`_).\\n\\nDevelopers can use this library to send application-specific state of execution to the host and receive commands or other types of information from the opposite direction at runtime. The main use cases of this library are:\\n\\n1. Collecting application-specific data. See :ref:`app_trace-application-specific-tracing`.\\n2. Lightweight logging to the host. See :ref:`app_trace-logging-to-host`.\\n3. System behavior analysis. See :ref:`app_trace-system-behaviour-analysis-with-segger-systemview`.\\n4. Source code coverage. See :ref:`app_trace-gcov-source-code-coverage`.\\n\\nTracing components used when working over JTAG interface are shown in the figure below.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/app_trace-overview.jpg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Tracing Components When Working Over JTAG\\n\\n    Tracing Components Used When Working Over JTAG\\n\\n\\nModes of Operation\\n------------------\\n\\nThe library supports two modes of operation:\\n\\n**Post-mortem mode:** This is the default mode. The mode does not need interaction with the host side. In this mode, tracing module does not check whether the host has read all the data from *HW UP BUFFER*, but directly overwrites old data with the new ones. This mode is useful when only the latest trace data is interesting to the user, e.g., for analyzing program\\'s behavior just before the crash. The host can read the data later on upon user request, e.g., via special OpenOCD command in case of working via JTAG interface.\\n\\n**Streaming mode:** Tracing module enters this mode when the host connects to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. In this mode, before writing new data to *HW UP BUFFER*, the tracing module checks that whether there is enough space in it and if necessary, waits for the host to read data and free enough memory. Maximum waiting time is controlled via timeout values passed by users to corresponding API routines. So when application tries to write data to the trace buffer using the finite value of the maximum waiting time, it is possible that this data will be dropped. This is especially true for tracing from time critical code (ISRs, OS scheduler code, etc.) where infinite timeouts can lead to system malfunction. In order to avoid loss of such critical data, developers can enable additional data buffering via menuconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_APPTRACE_PENDING_DATA_SIZE_MAX`. This macro specifies the size of data which can be buffered in above conditions. The option can also help to overcome situation when data transfer to the host is temporarily slowed down, e.g., due to USB bus congestions. But it will not help when the average bitrate of the trace data stream exceeds the hardware interface capabilities.\\n\\n\\nConfiguration Options and Dependencies\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nUsing of this feature depends on two components:\\n\\n1. **Host side:** Application tracing is done over JTAG, so it needs OpenOCD to be set up and running on host machine. For instructions on how to set it up, please see :doc:`JTAG Debugging <../api-guides/jtag-debugging/index>` for details.\\n\\n2. **Target side:** Application tracing functionality can be enabled in menuconfig. Please go to ``Component config`` > ``Application Level Tracing`` menu, which allows selecting destination for the trace data (hardware interface for transport: JTAG or/and UART). Choosing any of the destinations automatically enables the ``CONFIG_APPTRACE_ENABLE`` option. For UART interfaces, users have to define baud rate, TX and RX pins numbers, and additional UART-related parameters.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    In order to achieve higher data rates and minimize the number of dropped packets, it is recommended to optimize the setting of JTAG clock frequency, so that it is at maximum and still provides stable operation of JTAG. See :ref:`jtag-debugging-tip-optimize-jtag-speed`.\\n\\nThere are two additional menuconfig options not mentioned above:\\n\\n1. *Threshold for flushing last trace data to host on panic* (:ref:`CONFIG_APPTRACE_POSTMORTEM_FLUSH_THRESH`). This option is necessary due to the nature of working over JTAG. In this mode, trace data is exposed to the host in 16 KB blocks. In post-mortem mode, when one block is filled, it is exposed to the host and the previous one becomes unavailable. In other words, the trace data is overwritten in 16 KB granularity. On panic, the latest data from the current input block is exposed to the host and the host can read them for post-analysis. System panic may occur when a very small amount of data are not exposed to the host yet. In this case, the previous 16 KB of collected data will be lost and the host will see the latest, but very small piece of the trace. It can be insufficient to diagnose the problem. This menuconfig option allows avoiding such situations. It controls the threshold for flushing data in case of apanic. For example, users can decide that it needs no less than 512 bytes of the recent trace data, so if there is less then 512 bytes of pending data at the moment of panic, they will not be flushed and will not overwrite the previous 16 KB. The option is only meaningful in post-mortem mode and when working over JTAG.\\n\\n2. *Timeout for flushing last trace data to host on panic* (:ref:`CONFIG_APPTRACE_ONPANIC_HOST_FLUSH_TMO`). The option is only meaningful in streaming mode and it controls the maximum time that the tracing module will wait for the host to read the last data in case of panic.\\n\\n3. *UART RX/TX ring buffer size* (:ref:`CONFIG_APPTRACE_UART_TX_BUFF_SIZE`). The size of the buffer depends on the amount of data transfered through the UART.\\n\\n4. *UART TX message size* (:ref:`CONFIG_APPTRACE_UART_TX_MSG_SIZE`). The maximum size of the single message to transfer.\\n\\n\\nHow to Use This Library\\n-----------------------\\n\\nThis library provides APIs for transferring arbitrary data between the host and {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. When enabled in menuconfig, the target application tracing module is initialized automatically at the system startup, so all what the user needs to do is to call corresponding APIs to send, receive or flush the data.\\n\\n\\n.. _app_trace-application-specific-tracing:\\n\\nApplication Specific Tracing\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn general, users should decide what type of data should be transferred in every direction and how these data must be interpreted (processed). The following steps must be performed to transfer data between the target and the host:\\n\\n1. On the target side, users should implement algorithms for writing trace data to the host. Piece of code below shows an example on how to do this.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        #include \"esp_app_trace.h\"\\n        ...\\n        char buf[] = \"Hello World!\";\\n        esp_err_t res = esp_apptrace_write(ESP_APPTRACE_DEST_TRAX, buf, strlen(buf), ESP_APPTRACE_TMO_INFINITE);\\n        if (res != ESP_OK) {\\n            ESP_LOGE(TAG, \"Failed to write data to host!\");\\n            return res;\\n        }\\n\\n    ``esp_apptrace_write()`` function uses memcpy to copy user data to the internal buffer. In some cases, it can be more optimal to use ``esp_apptrace_buffer_get()`` and ``esp_apptrace_buffer_put()`` functions. They allow developers to allocate buffer and fill it themselves. The following piece of code shows how to do this.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        #include \"esp_app_trace.h\"\\n        ...\\n        int number = 10;\\n        char *ptr = (char *)esp_apptrace_buffer_get(ESP_APPTRACE_DEST_TRAX, 32, 100/*tmo in us*/);\\n        if (ptr == NULL) {\\n            ESP_LOGE(TAG, \"Failed to get buffer!\");\\n            return ESP_FAIL;\\n        }\\n        sprintf(ptr, \"Here is the number %d\", number);\\n        esp_err_t res = esp_apptrace_buffer_put(ESP_APPTRACE_DEST_TRAX, ptr, 100/*tmo in us*/);\\n        if (res != ESP_OK) {\\n            /* in case of error host tracing tool (e.g., OpenOCD) will report incomplete user buffer */\\n            ESP_LOGE(TAG, \"Failed to put buffer!\");\\n            return res;\\n        }\\n\\n    Also according to his needs, the user may want to receive data from the host. Piece of code below shows an example on how to do this.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        #include \"esp_app_trace.h\"\\n        ...\\n        char buf[32];\\n        char down_buf[32];\\n        size_t sz = sizeof(buf);\\n\\n        /* config down buffer */\\n        esp_apptrace_down_buffer_config(down_buf, sizeof(down_buf));\\n        /* check for incoming data and read them if any */\\n        esp_err_t res = esp_apptrace_read(ESP_APPTRACE_DEST_TRAX, buf, &sz, 0/*do not wait*/);\\n        if (res != ESP_OK) {\\n            ESP_LOGE(TAG, \"Failed to read data from host!\");\\n            return res;\\n        }\\n        if (sz > 0) {\\n            /* we have data, process them */\\n            ...\\n        }\\n\\n    ``esp_apptrace_read()`` function uses memcpy to copy host data to user buffer. In some casesm it can be more optimal to use ``esp_apptrace_down_buffer_get()`` and ``esp_apptrace_down_buffer_put()`` functions. They allow developers to occupy chunk of read buffer and process it in-place. The following piece of code shows how to do this.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: c\\n\\n        #include \"esp_app_trace.h\"\\n        ...\\n        char down_buf[32];\\n        uint32_t *number;\\n        size_t sz = 32;\\n\\n        /* config down buffer */\\n        esp_apptrace_down_buffer_config(down_buf, sizeof(down_buf));\\n        char *ptr = (char *)esp_apptrace_down_buffer_get(ESP_APPTRACE_DEST_TRAX, &sz, 100/*tmo in us*/);\\n        if (ptr == NULL) {\\n            ESP_LOGE(TAG, \"Failed to get buffer!\");\\n            return ESP_FAIL;\\n        }\\n        if (sz > 4) {\\n            number = (uint32_t *)ptr;\\n            printf(\"Here is the number %d\", *number);\\n        } else {\\n            printf(\"No data\");\\n        }\\n        esp_err_t res = esp_apptrace_down_buffer_put(ESP_APPTRACE_DEST_TRAX, ptr, 100/*tmo in us*/);\\n        if (res != ESP_OK) {\\n            /* in case of error host tracing tool (e.g., OpenOCD) will report incomplete user buffer */\\n            ESP_LOGE(TAG, \"Failed to put buffer!\");\\n            return res;\\n        }\\n\\n2. The next step is to build the program image and download it to the target as described in the :ref:`Getting Started Guide <get-started-build>`.\\n\\n3. Run OpenOCD (see :doc:`JTAG Debugging <../api-guides/jtag-debugging/index>`).\\n\\n4. Connect to OpenOCD telnet server. It can be done using the following command in terminal ``telnet <oocd_host> 4444``. If telnet session is opened on the same machine which runs OpenOCD, you can use ``localhost`` as ``<oocd_host>`` in the command above.\\n\\n5. Start trace data collection using special OpenOCD command. This command will transfer tracing data and redirect them to the specified file or socket (currently only files are supported as trace data destination). For description of the corresponding commands, see `OpenOCD Application Level Tracing Commands`_.\\n\\n6. The final step is to process received data. Since the format of data is defined by users, the processing stage is out of the scope of this document. Good starting points for data processor are python scripts in ``$IDF_PATH/tools/esp_app_trace``: ``apptrace_proc.py`` (used for feature tests) and ``logtrace_proc.py`` (see more details in section `Logging to Host`_).\\n\\n\\nOpenOCD Application Level Tracing Commands\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\n*HW UP BUFFER* is shared between user data blocks and the filling of the allocated memory is performed on behalf of the API caller (in task or ISR context). In multithreading environment, it can happen that the task/ISR which fills the buffer is preempted by another high priority task/ISR. So it is possible that the user data preparation process is not completed at the moment when that chunk is read by the host. To handle such conditions, the tracing module prepends all user data chunks with header which contains the allocated user buffer size (2 bytes) and the length of the actually written data (2 bytes). So the total length of the header is 4 bytes. OpenOCD command which reads trace data reports error when it reads incomplete user data chunk, but in any case, it puts the contents of the whole user chunk (including unfilled area) to the output file.\\n\\nBelow is the description of available OpenOCD application tracing commands.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Currently, OpenOCD does not provide commands to send arbitrary user data to the target.\\n\\n\\nCommand usage:\\n\\n``esp apptrace [start <options>] | [stop] | [status] | [dump <cores_num> <outfile>]``\\n\\nSub-commands:\\n\\n``start``\\n    Start tracing (continuous streaming).\\n``stop``\\n    Stop tracing.\\n``status``\\n    Get tracing status.\\n``dump``\\n    Dump all data from  (post-mortem dump).\\n\\n\\nStart command syntax:\\n\\n  ``start <outfile> [poll_period [trace_size [stop_tmo [wait4halt [skip_size]]]]``\\n\\n``outfile``\\n    Path to file to save data from both CPUs. This argument should have the following format: ``file://path/to/file``.\\n``poll_period``\\n    Data polling period (in ms) for available trace data. If greater than 0, then command runs in non-blocking mode. By default, 1 ms.\\n``trace_size``\\n    Maximum size of data to collect (in bytes). Tracing is stopped after specified amount of data is received. By default, -1 (trace size stop trigger is disabled).\\n``stop_tmo``\\n    Idle timeout (in sec). Tracing is stopped if there is no data for specified period of time. By default, -1 (disable this stop trigger). Optionally set it to value longer than longest pause between tracing commands from target.\\n``wait4halt``\\n    If 0, start tracing immediately, otherwise command waits for the target to be halted (after reset, by breakpoint etc.) and then automatically resumes it and starts tracing. By default, 0.\\n``skip_size``\\n    Number of bytes to skip at the start. By default, 0.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    If ``poll_period`` is 0, OpenOCD telnet command line will not be available until tracing is stopped. You must stop it manually by resetting the board or pressing Ctrl+C in OpenOCD window (not one with the telnet session). Another option is to set ``trace_size`` and wait until this size of data is collected. At this point, tracing stops automatically.\\n\\nCommand usage examples:\\n\\n.. highlight:: none\\n\\n1. Collect 2048 bytes of tracing data to the file ``trace.log``. The file will be saved in the ``openocd-esp32`` directory.\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n        esp apptrace start file://trace.log 1 2048 5 0 0\\n\\n    The tracing data will be retrieved and saved in non-blocking mode. This process will stop automatically after 2048 bytes are collected, or if no data are available for more than 5 seconds.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Tracing data is buffered before it is made available to OpenOCD. If you see \"Data timeout!\" message, then it is likely that the target is not sending enough data to empty the buffer to OpenOCD before the timeout. Either increase the timeout or use the function ``esp_apptrace_flush()`` to flush the data on specific intervals.\\n\\n2.  Retrieve tracing data indefinitely in non-blocking mode.\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n        esp apptrace start file://trace.log 1 -1 -1 0 0\\n\\n    There is no limitation on the size of collected data and there is no data timeout set. This process may be stopped by issuing ``esp apptrace stop`` command on OpenOCD telnet prompt, or by pressing Ctrl+C in OpenOCD window.\\n\\n3.  Retrieve tracing data and save them indefinitely.\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n        esp apptrace start file://trace.log 0 -1 -1 0 0\\n\\n    OpenOCD telnet command line prompt will not be available until tracing is stopped. To stop tracing, press Ctrl+C in the OpenOCD window.\\n\\n4.  Wait for the target to be halted. Then resume the target\\'s operation and start data retrieval. Stop after collecting 2048 bytes of data:\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n        esp apptrace start file://trace.log 0 2048 -1 1 0\\n\\n    To configure tracing immediately after reset, use the OpenOCD ``reset halt`` command.\\n\\n\\n.. _app_trace-logging-to-host:\\n\\nLogging to Host\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-IDF implements a useful feature: logging to the host via application level tracing library. This is a kind of semihosting when all `ESP_LOGx` calls send strings to be printed to the host instead of UART. This can be useful because \"printing to host\" eliminates some steps performed when logging to UART. Most part of the work is done on the host.\\n\\nBy default, ESP-IDF\\'s logging library uses vprintf-like function to write formatted output to dedicated UART. In general, it involves the following steps:\\n\\n1. Format string is parsed to obtain type of each argument.\\n2. According to its type, every argument is converted to string representation.\\n3. Format string combined with converted arguments is sent to UART.\\n\\nThough the implementation of the vprintf-like function can be optimized to a certain level, all steps above have to be performed in any case and every step takes some time (especially item 3). So it frequently occurs that with additional log added to the program to identify the problem, the program behavior is changed and the problem cannot be reproduced. And in the worst cases, the program cannot work normally at all and ends up with an error or even hangs.\\n\\nPossible ways to overcome this problem are to use higher UART bitrates (or another faster interface) and/or to move string formatting procedure to the host.\\n\\nThe application level tracing feature can be used to transfer log information to the host using ``esp_apptrace_vprintf`` function. This function does not perform full parsing of the format string and arguments. Instead, it just calculates the number of arguments passed and sends them along with the format string address to the host. On the host, log data is processed and printed out by a special Python script.\\n\\n\\nLimitations\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nCurrent implementation of logging over JTAG has some limitations:\\n\\n1. No support for tracing from ``ESP_EARLY_LOGx`` macros.\\n2. No support for printf arguments whose size exceeds 4 bytes (e.g., ``double`` and ``uint64_t``).\\n3. Only strings from the .rodata section are supported as format strings and arguments.\\n4. The maximum number of printf arguments is 256.\\n\\n\\nHow To Use It\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nIn order to use logging via trace module, users need to perform the following steps:\\n\\n1. On the target side, the special vprintf-like function :cpp:func:`esp_apptrace_vprintf` needs to be installed. It sends log data to the host. An example is ``esp_log_set_vprintf(esp_apptrace_vprintf);``. To send log data to UART again, use ``esp_log_set_vprintf(vprintf);``.\\n2. Follow instructions in items 2-5 in `Application Specific Tracing`_.\\n3. To print out collected log records, run the following command in terminal: ``$IDF_PATH/tools/esp_app_trace/logtrace_proc.py /path/to/trace/file /path/to/program/elf/file``.\\n\\n\\nLog Trace Processor Command Options\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nCommand usage:\\n\\n``logtrace_proc.py [-h] [--no-errors] <trace_file> <elf_file>``\\n\\nPositional arguments:\\n\\n``trace_file``\\n    Path to log trace file.\\n``elf_file``\\n    Path to program ELF file.\\n\\nOptional arguments:\\n\\n``-h``, ``--help``\\n    Show this help message and exit.\\n``--no-errors``, ``-n``\\n    Do not print errors.\\n\\n\\n.. _app_trace-system-behaviour-analysis-with-segger-systemview:\\n\\nSystem Behavior Analysis with SEGGER SystemView\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAnother useful ESP-IDF feature built on top of application tracing library is the system level tracing which produces traces compatible with SEGGER SystemView tool (see `SystemView <https://www.segger.com/products/development-tools/systemview/>`_). SEGGER SystemView is a real-time recording and visualization tool that allows to analyze runtime behavior of an application. It is possible to view events in real-time through the UART interface.\\n\\n\\nHow To Use It\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nSupport for this feature is enabled by ``Component config`` > ``Application Level Tracing`` > ``FreeRTOS SystemView Tracing`` (:ref:`CONFIG_APPTRACE_SV_ENABLE`) menuconfig option. There are several other options enabled under the same menu:\\n\\n1. SytemView destination. Select the destination interface: JTAG or UART. In case of UART, it will be possible to connect SystemView application to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} directly and receive data in real-time.\\n\\n2. {IDF_TARGET_NAME} timer to use as SystemView timestamp source: (:ref:`CONFIG_APPTRACE_SV_TS_SOURCE`) selects the source of timestamps for SystemView events. In the single core mode, timestamps are generated using {IDF_TARGET_NAME} internal cycle counter running at maximum 240 Mhz (about 4 ns granularity). In the dual-core mode, external timer working at 40 Mhz is used, so the timestamp granularity is 25 ns.\\n\\n3. Individually enabled or disabled collection of SystemView events (``CONFIG_APPTRACE_SV_EVT_XXX``):\\n\\n    - Trace Buffer Overflow Event\\n    - ISR Enter Event\\n    - ISR Exit Event\\n    - ISR Exit to Scheduler Event\\n    - Task Start Execution Event\\n    - Task Stop Execution Event\\n    - Task Start Ready State Event\\n    - Task Stop Ready State Event\\n    - Task Create Event\\n    - Task Terminate Event\\n    - System Idle Event\\n    - Timer Enter Event\\n    - Timer Exit Event\\n\\nESP-IDF has all the code required to produce SystemView compatible traces, so users can just configure necessary project options (see above), build, download the image to target, and use OpenOCD to collect data as described in the previous sections.\\n\\n4. Select Pro or App CPU in menuconfig options ``Component config`` > ``Application Level Tracing`` > ``FreeRTOS SystemView Tracing`` to trace over the UART interface in real-time.\\n\\n\\nOpenOCD SystemView Tracing Command Options\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nCommand usage:\\n\\n``esp sysview [start <options>] | [stop] | [status]``\\n\\nSub-commands:\\n\\n``start``\\n    Start tracing (continuous streaming).\\n``stop``\\n    Stop tracing.\\n``status``\\n    Get tracing status.\\n\\nStart command syntax:\\n\\n  ``start <outfile1> [outfile2] [poll_period [trace_size [stop_tmo]]]``\\n\\n``outfile1``\\n    Path to file to save data from PRO CPU.

This argument should have the following format: ``file://path/to/file``.\\n``poll_period``\\n    Data polling period (in ms) for available trace data. If greater than 0, then command runs in non-blocking mode. By default, 1 ms.\\n``trace_size``\\n    Maximum size of data to collect (in bytes). Tracing is stopped after specified amount of data is received. By default, -1 (trace size stop trigger is disabled).\\n``stop_tmo``\\n    Idle timeout (in sec). Tracing is stopped if there is no data for specified period of time. By default, -1 (disable this stop trigger).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    If ``poll_period`` is 0, OpenOCD telnet command line will not be available until tracing is stopped. You must stop it manually by resetting the board or pressing Ctrl+C in the OpenOCD window (not the one with the telnet session). Another option is to set ``trace_size`` and wait until this size of data is collected. At this point, tracing stops automatically.\\n\\nCommand usage examples:\\n\\n.. highlight:: none\\n\\n1.  Collect SystemView tracing data to files ``pro-cpu.SVDat`` and ``app-cpu.SVDat``. The files will be saved in ``openocd-esp32`` directory.\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n        esp sysview start file://pro-cpu.SVDat file://app-cpu.SVDat\\n\\n    The tracing data will be retrieved and saved in non-blocking mode. To stop this process, enter ``esp sysview stop`` command on OpenOCD telnet prompt, optionally pressing Ctrl+C in the OpenOCD window.\\n\\n2.  Retrieve tracing data and save them indefinitely.\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n        esp sysview start file://pro-cpu.SVDat file://app-cpu.SVDat 0 -1 -1\\n\\n    OpenOCD telnet command line prompt will not be available until tracing is stopped. To stop tracing, press Ctrl+C in the OpenOCD window.\\n\\n\\nData Visualization\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nAfter trace data are collected, users can use a special tool to visualize the results and inspect behavior of the program.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES\\n\\n    Unfortunately, SystemView does not support tracing from multiple cores. So when tracing from {IDF_TARGET_NAME} with JTAG interfaces in the dual-core mode, two files are generated: one for PRO CPU and another for APP CPU. Users can load each file into separate instances of the tool. For tracing over UART, users can select ``Component config`` > ``Application Level Tracing`` > ``FreeRTOS SystemView Tracing`` in menuconfig Pro or App to choose which CPU has to be traced.\\n\\nIt is uneasy and awkward to analyze data for every core in separate instance of the tool. Fortunately, there is an Eclipse plugin called *Impulse* which can load several trace files, thus making it possible to inspect events from both cores in one view. Also, this plugin has no limitation of 1,000,000 events as compared to the free version of SystemView.\\n\\nGood instructions on how to install, configure, and visualize data in Impulse from one core can be found `here <https://mcuoneclipse.com/2016/07/31/impulse-segger-systemview-in-eclipse/>`_.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    ESP-IDF uses its own mapping for SystemView FreeRTOS events IDs, so users need to replace the original file mapping ``$SYSVIEW_INSTALL_DIR/Description/SYSVIEW_FreeRTOS.txt`` with ``$IDF_PATH/tools/esp_app_trace/SYSVIEW_FreeRTOS.txt``. Also, contents of that ESP-IDF-specific file should be used when configuring SystemView serializer using the above link.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES\\n\\n    Configure Impulse for Dual Core Traces\\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n    After installing Impulse and ensuring that it can successfully load trace files for each core in separate tabs, users can add special Multi Adapter port and load both files into one view. To do this, users need to do the following steps in Eclipse:\\n\\n    1. Open the ``Signal Ports`` view. Go to ``Windows`` > ``Show View`` > ``Other menu``. Find the ``Signal Ports`` view in Impulse folder and double-click it.\\n    2. In the ``Signal Ports`` view, right-click ``Ports`` and select ``Add`` > ``New Multi Adapter Port``.\\n    3. In the open dialog box, click ``Add`` and select ``New Pipe/File``.\\n    4. In the open dialog box, select ``SystemView Serializer`` as Serializer and set path to PRO CPU trace file. Click ``OK``.\\n    5. Repeat the steps 3-4 for APP CPU trace file.\\n    6. Double-click the created port. View for this port should open.\\n    7. Click the ``Start/Stop Streaming`` button. Data should be loaded.\\n    8. Use the ``Zoom Out``, ``Zoom In`` and ``Zoom Fit`` buttons to inspect data.\\n    9. For settings measurement cursors and other features, please see `Impulse documentation <https://toem.de/index.php/products/impulse>`_).\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        If you have problems with visualization (no data is shown or strange behaviors of zoom action are observed), you can try to delete current signal hierarchy and double-click on the necessary file or port. Eclipse will ask you to create a new signal hierarchy.\\n\\n\\n.. _app_trace-gcov-source-code-coverage:\\n\\nGcov (Source Code Coverage)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBasics of Gcov and Gcovr\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nSource code coverage is data indicating the count and frequency of every program execution path that has been taken within a program\\'s runtime. `Gcov <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gcov>`_ is a GCC tool that, when used in concert with the compiler, can generate log files indicating the execution count of each line of a source file. The `Gcovr <https://gcovr.com/>`_ tool is a utility for managing Gcov and generating summarized code coverage results.\\n\\nGenerally, using Gcov to compile and run programs on the host will undergo these steps:\\n\\n1. Compile the source code using GCC with the ``--coverage`` option enabled. This will cause the compiler to generate a ``.gcno`` notes files during compilation. The notes files contain information to reconstruct execution path block graphs and map each block to source code line numbers. Each source file compiled with the ``--coverage`` option should have their own ``.gcno`` file of the same name (e.g., a ``main.c`` will generate a ``main.gcno`` when compiled).\\n\\n2. Execute the program. During execution, the program should generate ``.gcda`` data files. These data files contain the counts of the number of times an execution path was taken. The program will generate a ``.gcda`` file for each source file compiled with the ``--coverage`` option (e.g., ``main.c`` will generate a ``main.gcda``).\\n\\n3. Gcov or Gcovr can be used to generate a code coverage based on the ``.gcno``, ``.gcda``, and source files. Gcov will generate a text-based coverage report for each source file in the form of a ``.gcov`` file, whilst Gcovr will generate a coverage report in HTML format.\\n\\n\\nGcov and Gcovr in ESP-IDF\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nUsing Gcov in ESP-IDF is complicated due to the fact that the program is running remotely from the host (i.e., on the target). The code coverage data (i.e., the ``.gcda`` files) is initially stored on the target itself. OpenOCD is then used to dump the code coverage data from the target to the host via JTAG during runtime. Using Gcov in ESP-IDF can be split into the following steps.\\n\\n1. :ref:`app_trace-gcov-setup-project`\\n2. :ref:`app_trace-gcov-dumping-data`\\n3. :ref:`app_trace-gcov-generate-report`\\n\\n\\n.. _app_trace-gcov-setup-project:\\n\\nSetting Up a Project for Gcov\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nCompiler Option\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn order to obtain code coverage data in a project, one or more source files within the project must be compiled with the ``--coverage`` option. In ESP-IDF, this can be achieved at the component level or the individual source file level:\\n\\n- To cause all source files in a component to be compiled with the ``--coverage`` option, you can add ``target_compile_options(${COMPONENT_LIB} PRIVATE --coverage)`` to the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file of the component.\\n- To cause a select number of source files (e.g., ``source1.c`` and ``source2.c``) in the same component to be compiled with the ``--coverage`` option, you can add ``set_source_files_properties(source1.c source2.c PROPERTIES COMPILE_FLAGS --coverage)`` to the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file of the component.\\n\\nWhen a source file is compiled with the ``--coverage`` option (e.g., ``gcov_example.c``), the compiler will generate the ``gcov_example.gcno`` file in the project\\'s build directory.\\n\\n\\nProject Configuration\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nBefore building a project with source code coverage, make sure that the following project configuration options are enabled by running ``idf.py menuconfig``.\\n\\n- Enable the application tracing module by selecting ``Trace Memory`` for the :ref:`CONFIG_APPTRACE_DESTINATION1` option.\\n- Enable Gcov to the host via the :ref:`CONFIG_APPTRACE_GCOV_ENABLE`.\\n\\n\\n.. _app_trace-gcov-dumping-data:\\n\\nDumping Code Coverage Data\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nOnce a project has been complied with the ``--coverage`` option and flashed onto the target, code coverage data will be stored internally on the target (i.e., in trace memory) whilst the application runs. The process of transferring code coverage data from the target to the host is known as dumping.\\n\\nThe dumping of coverage data is done via OpenOCD (see :doc:`JTAG Debugging <../api-guides/jtag-debugging/index>` on how to setup and run OpenOCD). A dump is triggered by issuing commands to OpenOCD, therefore a telnet session to OpenOCD must be opened to issue such commands (run ``telnet localhost 4444``). Note that GDB could be used instead of telnet to issue commands to OpenOCD, however all commands issued from GDB will need to be prefixed as ``mon <oocd_command>``.\\n\\nWhen the target dumps code coverage data, the ``.gcda`` files are stored in the project\\'s build directory. For example, if ``gcov_example_main.c`` of the ``main`` component is compiled with the ``--coverage`` option, then dumping the code coverage data would generate a ``gcov_example_main.gcda`` in ``build/esp-idf/main/CMakeFiles/__idf_main.dir/gcov_example_main.c.gcda``. Note that the ``.gcno`` files produced during compilation are also placed in the same directory.\\n\\nThe dumping of code coverage data can be done multiple times throughout an application\\'s lifetime. Each dump will simply update the ``.gcda`` file with the newest code coverage information. Code coverage data is accumulative, thus the newest data will contain the total execution count of each code path over the application\\'s entire lifetime.\\n\\nESP-IDF supports two methods of dumping code coverage data form the target to the host:\\n\\n* Instant Run-Time Dumpgit\\n* Hard-coded Dump\\n\\n\\nInstant Run-Time Dump\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nAn Instant Run-Time Dump is triggered by calling the ``{IDF_TARGET_NAME} gcov`` OpenOCD command (via a telnet session). Once called, OpenOCD will immediately preempt the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s current state and execute a built-in ESP-IDF Gcov debug stub function. The debug stub function will handle the dumping of data to the host. Upon completion, the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} will resume its current state.\\n\\n\\nHard-coded Dump\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nA Hard-coded Dump is triggered by the application itself by calling :cpp:func:`esp_gcov_dump` from somewhere within the application. When called, the application will halt and wait for OpenOCD to connect and retrieve the code coverage data. Once :cpp:func:`esp_gcov_dump` is called, the host must execute the ``esp gcov dump`` OpenOCD command (via a telnet session). The ``esp gcov dump`` command will cause OpenOCD to connect to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, retrieve the code coverage data, then disconnect from the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, thus allowing the application to resume. Hard-coded Dumps can also be triggered multiple times throughout an application\\'s lifetime.\\n\\nHard-coded dumps are useful if code coverage data is required at certain points of an application\\'s lifetime by placing :cpp:func:`esp_gcov_dump` where necessary (e.g., after application initialization, during each iteration of an application\\'s main loop).\\n\\nGDB can be used to set a breakpoint on :cpp:func:`esp_gcov_dump`, then call ``mon esp gcov dump`` automatically via the use a ``gdbinit`` script (see Using GDB from :ref:`jtag-debugging-using-debugger-command-line`).\\n\\nThe following GDB script will add a breakpoint at :cpp:func:`esp_gcov_dump`, then call the ``mon esp gcov dump`` OpenOCD command.\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    b esp_gcov_dump\\n    commands\\n    mon esp gcov dump\\n    end\\n\\n\\n.. note::\\n    Note that all OpenOCD commands should be invoked in GDB as: ``mon <oocd_command>``.\\n\\n\\n.. _app_trace-gcov-generate-report:\\n\\nGenerating Coverage Report\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nOnce the code coverage data has been dumped, the ``.gcno``, ``.gcda`` and the source files can be used to generate a code coverage report. A code coverage report is simply a report indicating the number of times each line in a source file has been executed.\\n\\nBoth Gcov and Gcovr can be used to generate code coverage reports. Gcov is provided along with the Xtensa toolchain, whilst Gcovr may need to be installed separately. For details on how to use Gcov or Gcovr, refer to `Gcov documentation <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov.html>`_ and `Gcovr documentation <https://gcovr.com/>`_.\\n\\n\\nAdding Gcovr Build Target to Project\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nTo make report generation more convenient, users can define additional build targets in their projects such that the report generation can be done with a single build command.\\n\\nAdd the following lines to the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file of your project.\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/gcov.cmake)\\n    idf_create_coverage_report(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/coverage_report)\\n    idf_clean_coverage_report(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/coverage_report)\\n\\nThe following commands can now be used:\\n\\n    * ``cmake --build build/ --target gcovr-report`` will generate an HTML coverage report in ``$(BUILD_DIR_BASE)/coverage_report/html`` directory.\\n    * ``cmake --build build/ --target cov-data-clean`` will remove all coverage data files.\\n',\n",
       " 'Fatal Errors\\n============\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\n.. _Overview:\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nIn certain situations, the execution of the program can not be continued in a well-defined way. In ESP-IDF, these situations include:\\n\\n- CPU Exceptions: |CPU_EXCEPTIONS_LIST|\\n- System level checks and safeguards:\\n\\n  .. list::\\n\\n     - :doc:`Interrupt watchdog <../api-reference/system/wdts>` timeout\\n     - :doc:`Task watchdog <../api-reference/system/wdts>` timeout (only fatal if :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TASK_WDT_PANIC` is set)\\n     - Cache access error\\n     :SOC_MEMPROT_SUPPORTED: - Memory protection fault\\n     - Brownout detection event\\n     - Stack overflow\\n     - Stack smashing protection check\\n     - Heap integrity check\\n     - Undefined behavior sanitizer (UBSAN) checks\\n\\n- Failed assertions, via ``assert``, ``configASSERT`` and similar macros.\\n\\nThis guide explains the procedure used in ESP-IDF for handling these errors, and provides suggestions on troubleshooting the errors.\\n\\nPanic Handler\\n-------------\\n\\nEvery error cause listed in the `Overview`_ will be handled by the *panic handler*.\\n\\nThe panic handler will start by printing the cause of the error to the console. For CPU exceptions, the message will be similar to\\n\\n.. parsed-literal::\\n\\n    Guru Meditation Error: Core 0 panic\\'ed (|ILLEGAL_INSTR_MSG|). Exception was unhandled.\\n\\nFor some of the system level checks (interrupt watchdog, cache access error), the message will be similar to\\n\\n.. parsed-literal::\\n\\n    Guru Meditation Error: Core 0 panic\\'ed (|CACHE_ERR_MSG|). Exception was unhandled.\\n\\nIn all cases, the error cause will be printed in parentheses. See `Guru Meditation Errors`_ for a list of possible error causes.\\n\\nSubsequent behavior of the panic handler can be set using :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_PANIC` configuration choice. The available options are:\\n\\n- Print registers and reboot (``CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_PANIC_PRINT_REBOOT``) — default option.\\n\\n  This will print register values at the point of the exception, print the backtrace, and restart the chip.\\n\\n- Print registers and halt (``CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_PANIC_PRINT_HALT``)\\n\\n  Similar to the above option, but halt instead of rebooting. External reset is required to restart the program.\\n\\n- Silent reboot (``CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_PANIC_SILENT_REBOOT``)\\n\\n  Do not print registers or backtrace, restart the chip immediately.\\n\\n- Invoke GDB Stub (``CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_PANIC_GDBSTUB``)\\n\\n  Start GDB server which can communicate with GDB over console UART port. This option will only provide read-only debugging or post-mortem debugging. See `GDB Stub`_ for more details.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  The ``CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_PANIC_GDBSTUB`` choice in the configuration option :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_PANIC` is only available when the component ``esp_gdbstub`` is included in the build.\\n\\nThe behavior of the panic handler is affected by three other configuration options.\\n\\n- If :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_DEBUG_OCDAWARE` is enabled (which is the default), the panic handler will detect whether a JTAG debugger is connected. If it is, execution will be halted and control will be passed to the debugger. In this case, registers and backtrace are not dumped to the console, and GDBStub / Core Dump functions are not used.\\n\\n- If the :doc:`Core Dump <core_dump>` feature is enabled, then the system state (task stacks and registers) will be dumped to either Flash or UART, for later analysis.\\n\\n- If :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_PANIC_HANDLER_IRAM` is disabled (disabled by default), the panic handler code is placed in flash memory, not IRAM. This means that if ESP-IDF crashes while flash cache is disabled, the panic handler will automatically re-enable flash cache before running GDB Stub or Core Dump. This adds some minor risk, if the flash cache status is also corrupted during the crash.\\n\\n  If this option is enabled, the panic handler code (including required UART functions) is placed in IRAM, and hence will decrease the usable memory space in SRAM. But this may be necessary to debug some complex issues with crashes while flash cache is disabled (for example, when writing to SPI flash) or when flash cache is corrupted when an exception is triggered.\\n\\n- If :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_PANIC_REBOOT_DELAY_SECONDS` is enabled (disabled by default) and set to a number higher than 0, the panic handler will delay the reboot for that amount of time in seconds. This can help if the tool used to monitor serial output does not provide a possibility to stop and examine the serial output. In that case, delaying the reboot will allow users to examine and debug the panic handler output (backtrace, etc.) for the duration of the delay. After the delay, the device will reboot. The reset reason is preserved.\\n\\nThe following diagram illustrates the panic handler behavior:\\n\\n.. blockdiag::\\n    :scale: 100%\\n    :caption: Panic Handler Flowchart (click to enlarge)\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    blockdiag panic-handler {\\n        orientation = portrait;\\n        edge_layout = flowchart;\\n        default_group_color = white;\\n        node_width = 160;\\n        node_height = 60;\\n\\n        cpu_exception [label = \"CPU Exception\", shape=roundedbox];\\n        sys_check [label = \"Cache error,\\\\nInterrupt WDT,\\\\nabort()\", shape=roundedbox];\\n        check_ocd [label = \"JTAG debugger\\\\nconnected?\", shape=diamond, height=80];\\n        print_error_cause [label = \"Print error/\\\\nexception cause\"];\\n        use_jtag [label = \"Send signal to\\\\nJTAG debugger\", shape=roundedbox];\\n        dump_registers [label = \"Print registers\\\\nand backtrace\"];\\n        check_coredump [label = \"Core dump\\\\nenabled?\", shape=diamond, height=80];\\n        do_coredump [label = \"Core dump\\\\nto UART or Flash\"];\\n        check_gdbstub [label = \"GDB Stub\\\\nenabled?\", shape=diamond, height=80];\\n        do_gdbstub [label = \"Start GDB Stub\", shape=roundedbox];\\n        halt [label = \"Halt\", shape=roundedbox];\\n        reboot [label = \"Reboot\", shape=roundedbox];\\n        check_halt [label = \"Halt?\", shape=diamond, height=80];\\n\\n        group {cpu_exception, sys_check};\\n\\n        cpu_exception -> print_error_cause;\\n        sys_check -> print_error_cause;\\n        print_error_cause -> check_ocd;\\n        check_ocd -> use_jtag [label = \"Yes\"];\\n        check_ocd -> dump_registers [label = \"No\"];\\n        dump_registers -> check_coredump\\n        check_coredump -> do_coredump [label = \"Yes\"];\\n        do_coredump -> check_gdbstub;\\n        check_coredump -> check_gdbstub [label = \"No\"];\\n        check_gdbstub -> check_halt [label = \"No\"];\\n        check_gdbstub -> do_gdbstub [label = \"Yes\"];\\n        check_halt -> halt [label = \"Yes\"];\\n        check_halt -> reboot [label = \"No\"];\\n    }\\n\\nRegister Dump and Backtrace\\n---------------------------\\n\\nUnless the ``CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_PANIC_SILENT_REBOOT`` option is enabled, the panic handler prints some of the CPU registers, and the backtrace, to the console\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_XTENSA\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n        Core 0 register dump:\\n        PC      : 0x400e14ed  PS      : 0x00060030  A0      : 0x800d0805  A1      : 0x3ffb5030\\n        A2      : 0x00000000  A3      : 0x00000001  A4      : 0x00000001  A5      : 0x3ffb50dc\\n        A6      : 0x00000000  A7      : 0x00000001  A8      : 0x00000000  A9      : 0x3ffb5000\\n        A10     : 0x00000000  A11     : 0x3ffb2bac  A12     : 0x40082d1c  A13     : 0x06ff1ff8\\n        A14     : 0x3ffb7078  A15     : 0x00000000  SAR     : 0x00000014  EXCCAUSE: 0x0000001d\\n        EXCVADDR: 0x00000000  LBEG    : 0x4000c46c  LEND    : 0x4000c477  LCOUNT  : 0xffffffff\\n\\n        Backtrace: 0x400e14ed:0x3ffb5030 0x400d0802:0x3ffb5050\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_RISCV\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n        Core  0 register dump:\\n        MEPC    : 0x420048b4  RA      : 0x420048b4  SP      : 0x3fc8f2f0  GP      : 0x3fc8a600\\n        TP      : 0x3fc8a2ac  T0      : 0x40057fa6  T1      : 0x0000000f  T2      : 0x00000000\\n        S0/FP   : 0x00000000  S1      : 0x00000000  A0      : 0x00000001  A1      : 0x00000001\\n        A2      : 0x00000064  A3      : 0x00000004  A4      : 0x00000001  A5      : 0x00000000\\n        A6      : 0x42001fd6  A7      : 0x00000000  S2      : 0x00000000  S3      : 0x00000000\\n        S4      : 0x00000000  S5      : 0x00000000  S6      : 0x00000000  S7      : 0x00000000\\n        S8      : 0x00000000  S9      : 0x00000000  S10     : 0x00000000  S11     : 0x00000000\\n        T3      : 0x00000000  T4      : 0x00000000  T5      : 0x00000000  T6      : 0x00000000\\n        MSTATUS : 0x00001881  MTVEC   : 0x40380001  MCAUSE  : 0x00000007  MTVAL   : 0x00000000\\n        MHARTID : 0x00000000\\n\\nThe register values printed are the register values in the exception frame, i.e., values at the moment when the CPU exception or another fatal error has occurred.\\n\\nA Register dump is not printed if the panic handler has been executed as a result of an ``abort()`` call.\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_XTENSA\\n\\n    In some cases, such as interrupt watchdog timeout, the panic handler may print additional CPU registers (EPC1-EPC4) and the registers/backtrace of the code running on the other CPU.\\n\\n    The backtrace line contains PC:SP pairs, where PC is the Program Counter and SP is Stack Pointer, for each stack frame of the current task.

Thus, in order to generate and print a backtrace while using another monitor program, it is possible to activate :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_USE_EH_FRAME` option from the menuconfig.\\n\\n    This option will let the compiler generate DWARF information for each function of the project. Then, when a CPU exception occurs, the panic handler will parse these data and determine the backtrace of the task that failed. The output looks like this:\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n        Backtrace: 0x42009e9a:0x3fc92120 0x42009ea6:0x3fc92120 0x42009ec2:0x3fc92130 0x42024620:0x3fc92150 0x40387d7c:0x3fc92160 0xfffffffe:0x3fc92170\\n\\n    These ``PC:SP`` pairs represent the PC (Program Counter) and SP (Stack Pointer) for each stack frame of the current task.\\n\\n\\n    The main benefit of the :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_USE_EH_FRAME` option is that the backtrace is generated by the board itself (without the need for :doc:`IDF Monitor <tools/idf-monitor>`). However, the option\\'s drawback is that it results in an increase of the compiled binary\\'s size (ranging from 20% to 100% increase in size). Furthermore, this option causes debug information to be included within the compiled binary. Therefore, users are strongly advised not to enable this option in mass/final production builds.\\n\\nTo find the location where a fatal error has happened, look at the lines which follow the \"Backtrace\" line. Fatal error location is the top line, and subsequent lines show the call stack.\\n\\n.. _GDB-Stub:\\n\\nGDB Stub\\n--------\\n\\nIf the ``CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_PANIC_GDBSTUB`` option is enabled, the panic handler will not reset the chip when a fatal error happens. Instead, it will start a GDB remote protocol server, commonly referred to as GDB Stub. When this happens, a GDB instance running on the host computer can be instructed to connect to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} UART port.\\n\\nIf :doc:`IDF Monitor <tools/idf-monitor>` is used, GDB is started automatically when a GDB Stub prompt is detected on the UART.

It is enabled by default (see :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_WDT_ENABLE`). If the execution time is exceeded, the RTC watchdog will restart the system. In this case, the ROM bootloader will print a message with the ``RTC Watchdog Timeout`` reason for the reboot.\\n\\n::\\n\\n    rst:0x10 ({IDF_TARGET_RTCWDT_RTC_RESET})\\n\\n\\nThe RTC watchdog covers the execution time from the first stage bootloader (ROM bootloader) to application startup. It is initially set in the ROM bootloader, then configured in the bootloader with the :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_WDT_TIME_MS` option (9000 ms by default). During the application initialization stage, it is reconfigured because the source of the slow clock may have changed, and finally disabled right before the ``app_main()`` call. There is an option :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_WDT_DISABLE_IN_USER_CODE` which prevents the RTC watchdog from being disabled before ``app_main``. Instead, the RTC watchdog remains active and must be fed periodically in your application\\'s code.\\n\\n.. _Guru-Meditation-Errors:\\n\\nGuru Meditation Errors\\n----------------------\\n\\n..

The most common reasons for this error include:\\n\\n- FreeRTOS task function has returned. In FreeRTOS, if a task function needs to terminate, it should call :cpp:func:`vTaskDelete` and delete itself, instead of returning.\\n\\n- Failure to read next instruction from SPI flash. This usually happens if:\\n\\n  - Application has reconfigured the SPI flash pins as some other function (GPIO, UART, etc.). Consult the Hardware Design Guidelines and the datasheet for the chip or module for details about the SPI flash pins.\\n\\n  - Some external device has accidentally been connected to the SPI flash pins, and has interfered with communication between {IDF_TARGET_NAME} and SPI flash.\\n\\n- In C++ code, exiting from a non-void function without returning a value is considered to be an undefined behavior. When optimizations are enabled, the compiler will often omit the epilogue in such functions. This most often results in an |ILLEGAL_INSTR_MSG| exception. By default, ESP-IDF build system enables ``-Werror=return-type`` which means that missing return statements are treated as compile time errors. However if the application project disables compiler warnings, this issue might go undetected and the |ILLEGAL_INSTR_MSG| exception will occur at run time.\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_XTENSA\\n\\n    InstrFetchProhibited\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    This CPU exception indicates that the CPU could not read an instruction because the address of the instruction does not belong to a valid region in instruction RAM or ROM.\\n\\n    Usually, this means an attempt to call a function pointer, which does not point to valid code. ``PC`` (Program Counter) register can be used as an indicator: it will be zero or will contain a garbage value (not ``0x4xxxxxxx``).\\n\\n    LoadProhibited, StoreProhibited\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    These CPU exceptions happen when an application attempts to read from or write to an invalid memory location. The address which has been written/read is found in the ``EXCVADDR`` register in the register dump. If this address is zero, it usually means that the application has attempted to dereference a NULL pointer. If this address is close to zero, it usually means that the application has attempted to access a member of a structure, but the pointer to the structure is NULL. If this address is something else (garbage value, not in ``0x3fxxxxxx`` - ``0x6xxxxxxx`` range), it likely means that the pointer used to access the data is either not initialized or has been corrupted.\\n\\n    IntegerDivideByZero\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Application has attempted to do an integer division by zero.\\n\\n    LoadStoreAlignment\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Application has attempted to read or write a memory location, and the address alignment does not match the load/store size. For example, a 32-bit read can only be done from a 4-byte aligned address, and a 16-bit write can only be done to a 2-byte aligned address.\\n\\n    LoadStoreError\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    This exception may happen in the following cases:\\n\\n    - If the application has attempted to do an 8- or 16- bit read to, or write from, a memory region which only supports 32-bit reads/writes. For example, dereferencing a ``char*`` pointer to instruction memory (IRAM, IROM) will result in such an error.\\n\\n    - If the application has attempted to write to a read-only memory region, such as IROM or DROM.\\n\\n    Unhandled Debug Exception\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    This CPU exception happens when the instruction ``BREAK`` is executed.\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_RISCV\\n\\n    Instruction Address Misaligned\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    This CPU exception indicates that the address of the instruction to execute is not 2-byte aligned.\\n\\n    Instruction Access Fault, Load Access Fault, Store Access Fault\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    This CPU exception happens when application attempts to execute, read from or write to an invalid memory location. The address which was written/read is found in ``MTVAL`` register in the register dump. If this address is zero, it usually means that application attempted to dereference a NULL pointer. If this address is close to zero, it usually means that application attempted to access member of a structure, but the pointer to the structure was NULL. If this address is something else (garbage value, not in ``0x3fxxxxxx`` - ``0x6xxxxxxx`` range), it likely means that the pointer used to access the data was either not initialized or was corrupted.\\n\\n    Breakpoint\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    This CPU exception happens when the instruction ``EBREAK`` is executed. See also :ref:`FreeRTOS-End-Of-Stack-Watchpoint`.\\n\\n    Load Address Misaligned, Store Address Misaligned\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Application has attempted to read or write memory location, and address alignment did not match load/store size. For example, 32-bit load can only be done from 4-byte aligned address, and 16-bit load can only be done from a 2-byte aligned address.\\n\\nInterrupt Watchdog Timeout on CPU0/CPU1\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIndicates that an interrupt watchdog timeout has occurred. See :doc:`Watchdogs <../api-reference/system/wdts>` for more information.\\n\\n|CACHE_ERR_MSG|\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn some situations, ESP-IDF will temporarily disable access to external SPI Flash and SPI RAM via caches. For example, this happens when spi_flash APIs are used to read/write/erase/mmap regions of SPI Flash. In these situations, tasks are suspended, and interrupt handlers not registered with ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_IRAM`` are disabled. Make sure that any interrupt handlers registered with this flag have all the code and data in IRAM/DRAM. Refer to the :ref:`SPI flash API documentation <iram-safe-interrupt-handlers>` for more details.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_MEMPROT_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Memory Protection Fault\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} Permission Control feature is used in ESP-IDF to prevent the following types of memory access:\\n\\n    * writing to instruction RAM after the program is loaded\\n    * executing code from data RAM (areas used for heap and static .data and .bss)\\n\\n    Such operations are not necessary for most programs. Prohibiting such operations typically makes software vulnerabilities harder to exploit. Applications which rely on dynamic loading or self-modifying code may disable this protection using :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_MEMPROT_FEATURE` Kconfig option.\\n\\n    When the fault occurs, the panic handler reports the address of the fault and the type of memory access that caused it.\\n\\nOther Fatal Errors\\n------------------\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_BOD_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Brownout\\n    ^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has a built-in brownout detector, which is enabled by default. The brownout detector can trigger a system reset if the supply voltage goes below a safe level. The brownout detector can be configured using :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_BROWNOUT_DET` and :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_BROWNOUT_DET_LVL_SEL` options.\\n\\n    When the brownout detector triggers, the following message is printed::\\n\\n        Brownout detector was triggered\\n\\n    The chip is reset after the message is printed.\\n\\n    Note that if the supply voltage is dropping at a fast rate, only part of the message may be seen on the console.\\n\\n\\nCorrupt Heap\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-IDF\\'s heap implementation contains a number of run-time checks of the heap structure. Additional checks (\"Heap Poisoning\") can be enabled in menuconfig. If one of the checks fails, a message similar to the following will be printed::\\n\\n    CORRUPT HEAP: Bad tail at 0x3ffe270a. Expected 0xbaad5678 got 0xbaac5678\\n    assertion \"head != NULL\" failed: file \"/Users/user/esp/esp-idf/components/heap/multi_heap_poisoning.c\", line 201, function: multi_heap_free\\n    abort() was called at PC 0x400dca43 on core 0\\n\\nConsult :doc:`Heap Memory Debugging <../api-reference/system/heap_debug>` documentation for further information.\\n\\n|STACK_OVERFLOW|\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_ASSIST_DEBUG_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Hardware Stack Guard\\n    \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\n    {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has an integrated assist-debug module that can watch the SP register to ensure that it is within the bounds of allocated stack memory. The assist-debug module needs to set new stack bounds on every interrupt handling and FreeRTOS context switch. This can have a small impact on performance.\\n\\n    Here are some additional details about the assist-debug module:\\n\\n    - Implemented in hardware\\n    - Watches Stack Pointer register value\\n    - Requires no additional CPU time or memory while watching stack bounds\\n\\n    When the assist-debug module detects a stack overflow, the panic handler will run and display a message that resembles the following:\\n\\n    .. parsed-literal::\\n\\n        Guru Meditation Error: Core 0 panic\\'ed (Stack protection fault).\\n\\n    Hardware stack guard can be disabled using :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_HW_STACK_GUARD` options.\\n\\n.. _FreeRTOS-End-Of-Stack-Watchpoint:\\n\\nFreeRTOS End of Stack Watchpoint\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nESP-IDF provides a custom FreeRTOS stack overflow detecting mechanism based on watchpoints. Every time FreeRTOS switches task context, one of the watchpoints is set to watch the last 32 bytes of stack.\\n\\nGenerally, this may cause the watchpoint to be triggered up to 28 bytes earlier than expected. The value 32 is chosen because it is larger than the stack canary size in FreeRTOS (20 bytes). Adopting this approach ensures that the watchpoint triggers before the stack canary is corrupted, not after.\\n\\n.. note::\\n    Not every stack overflow is guaranteed to trigger the watchpoint. It is possible that the task writes to memory beyond the stack canary location, in which case the watchpoint will not be triggered.\\n\\nIf watchpoint triggers, the message will be similar to:\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_XTENSA\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n        Debug exception reason: Stack canary watchpoint triggered (task_name)\\n\\n.. only:: CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_RISCV\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n        Guru Meditation Error: Core  0 panic\\'ed (Breakpoint).

It can be enabled at file, component, or project level by adding the ``-fsanitize=undefined`` compiler option in the build system.\\n\\nWhen enabling UBSAN for code which uses the SOC hardware register header files (``soc/xxx_reg.h``), it is recommended to disable shift-base sanitizer using ``-fno-sanitize=shift-base`` option. This is due to the fact that ESP-IDF register header files currently contain patterns which cause false positives for this specific sanitizer option.\\n\\nTo enable UBSAN at project level, add the following code at the end of the project\\'s ``CMakeLists.txt`` file::\\n\\n    idf_build_set_property(COMPILE_OPTIONS \"-fsanitize=undefined\" \"-fno-sanitize=shift-base\" APPEND)\\n\\nAlternatively, pass these options through the ``EXTRA_CFLAGS`` and ``EXTRA_CXXFLAGS`` environment variables.\\n\\nEnabling UBSAN results in significant increase of code and data size. Most applications, except for the trivial ones, will not fit into the available RAM of the microcontroller when UBSAN is enabled for the whole application. Therefore it is recommended that UBSAN is instead enabled for specific components under test.\\n\\nTo enable UBSAN for a specific component (``component_name``) from the project\\'s ``CMakeLists.txt`` file, add the following code at the end of the file::\\n\\n    idf_component_get_property(lib component_name COMPONENT_LIB)\\n    target_compile_options(${lib} PRIVATE \"-fsanitize=undefined\" \"-fno-sanitize=shift-base\")\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  See the build system documentation for more information about :ref:`build properties <cmake-build-properties>` and :ref:`component properties <cmake-component-properties>`.\\n\\nTo enable UBSAN for a specific component (``component_name``) from ``CMakeLists.txt`` of the same component, add the following at the end of the file::\\n\\n    target_compile_options(${COMPONENT_LIB} PRIVATE \"-fsanitize=undefined\" \"-fno-sanitize=shift-base\")\\n\\nUBSAN Output\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nWhen UBSAN detects an error, a message and the backtrace are printed, for example::\\n\\n    Undefined behavior of type out_of_bounds\\n\\n    Backtrace:0x4008b383:0x3ffcd8b0 0x4008c791:0x3ffcd8d0 0x4008c587:0x3ffcd8f0 0x4008c6be:0x3ffcd950 0x400db74f:0x3ffcd970 0x400db99c:0x3ffcd9a0\\n\\nWhen using :doc:`IDF Monitor <tools/idf-monitor>`, the backtrace will be decoded to function names and source code locations, pointing to the location where the issue has happened (here it is ``main.c:128``)::\\n\\n    0x4008b383: panic_abort at /path/to/esp-idf/components/esp_system/panic.c:367\\n\\n    0x4008c791: esp_system_abort at /path/to/esp-idf/components/esp_system/system_api.c:106\\n\\n    0x4008c587: __ubsan_default_handler at /path/to/esp-idf/components/esp_system/ubsan.c:152\\n\\n    0x4008c6be: __ubsan_handle_out_of_bounds at /path/to/esp-idf/components/esp_system/ubsan.c:223\\n\\n    0x400db74f: test_ub at main.c:128\\n\\n    0x400db99c: app_main at main.c:56 (discriminator 1)\\n\\nThe types of errors reported by UBSAN can be as follows:\\n\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n  :widths: 40 60\\n  :header-rows: 1\\n\\n  * - Name\\n    - Meaning\\n  * - ``type_mismatch``, ``type_mismatch_v1``\\n    - Incorrect pointer value: null, unaligned, not compatible with the given type.\\n  * - ``add_overflow``, ``sub_overflow``, ``mul_overflow``, ``negate_overflow``\\n    - Integer overflow during addition, subtraction, multiplication, negation.\\n  * - ``divrem_overflow``\\n    - Integer division by 0 or ``INT_MIN``.\\n  * - ``shift_out_of_bounds``\\n    - Overflow in left or right shift operators.\\n  * - ``out_of_bounds``\\n    - Access outside of bounds of an array.\\n  * - ``unreachable``\\n    - Unreachable code executed.\\n  * - ``missing_return``\\n    - Non-void function has reached its end without returning a value (C++ only).\\n  * - ``vla_bound_not_positive``\\n    - Size of variable length array is not positive.\\n  * - ``load_invalid_value``\\n    - Value of ``bool`` or ``enum`` (C++ only) variable is invalid (out of bounds).\\n  * - ``nonnull_arg``\\n    - Null argument passed to a function which is declared with a ``nonnull`` attribute.\\n  * - ``nonnull_return``\\n    - Null value returned from a function which is declared with ``returns_nonnull`` attribute.\\n  * - ``builtin_unreachable``\\n    - ``__builtin_unreachable`` function called.\\n  * - ``pointer_overflow``\\n    - Overflow in pointer arithmetic.\\n',\n",

       " 'Application Startup Flow\\n========================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThis note explains various steps which happen before ``app_main`` function of an ESP-IDF application is called.\\n\\nThe high level view of startup process is as follows:\\n\\n1. :ref:`first-stage-bootloader` in ROM loads second-stage bootloader image to RAM (IRAM & DRAM) from flash offset {IDF_TARGET_CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_OFFSET_IN_FLASH}.\\n\\n2. :ref:`second-stage-bootloader` loads partition table and main app image from flash. Main app incorporates both RAM segments and read-only segments mapped via flash cache.\\n\\n3. :ref:`application-startup` executes. At this point the second CPU and RTOS scheduler are started.\\n\\nThis process is explained in detail in the following sections.\\n\\n.. _first-stage-bootloader:\\n\\nFirst Stage Bootloader\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES\\n\\n    After SoC reset, PRO CPU will start running immediately, executing reset vector code, while APP CPU will be held in reset. During startup process, PRO CPU does all the initialization. APP CPU reset is de-asserted in the ``call_start_cpu0`` function of application startup code. Reset vector code is located in the mask ROM of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip and cannot be modified.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES\\n\\n    After SoC reset, the CPU will start running immediately to perform initialization. The reset vector code is located in the mask ROM of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip and cannot be modified.\\n\\nStartup code called from the reset vector determines the boot mode by checking ``GPIO_STRAP_REG`` register for bootstrap pin states. Depending on the reset reason, the following takes place:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    :SOC_RTC_MEM_SUPPORTED: #. Reset from deep sleep: if the value in ``RTC_CNTL_STORE6_REG`` is non-zero, and CRC value of RTC memory in ``RTC_CNTL_STORE7_REG`` is valid, use ``RTC_CNTL_STORE6_REG`` as an entry point address and jump immediately to it. If ``RTC_CNTL_STORE6_REG`` is zero, or ``RTC_CNTL_STORE7_REG`` contains invalid CRC, or once the code called via ``RTC_CNTL_STORE6_REG`` returns, proceed with boot as if it was a power-on reset. **Note**: to run customized code at this point, a deep sleep stub mechanism is provided. Please see :doc:`deep sleep <deep-sleep-stub>` documentation for this.\\n\\n    #. For power-on reset, software SoC reset, and watchdog SoC reset: check the ``GPIO_STRAP_REG`` register if a custom boot mode (such as UART Download Mode) is requested. If this is the case, this custom loader mode is executed from ROM. Otherwise, proceed with boot as if it was due to software CPU reset. Consult {IDF_TARGET_NAME} datasheet for a description of SoC boot modes and how to execute them.\\n\\n    #. For software CPU reset and watchdog CPU reset: configure SPI flash based on EFUSE values, and attempt to load the code from flash. This step is described in more detail in the next paragraphs.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    During normal boot modes the RTC watchdog is enabled when this happens, so if the process is interrupted or stalled then the watchdog will reset the SOC automatically and repeat the boot process. This may cause the SoC to strap into a new boot mode, if the strapping GPIOs have changed.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    Second stage bootloader binary image is loaded from flash starting at address {IDF_TARGET_CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_OFFSET_IN_FLASH}.

TODO: describe application binary image format, describe optional flash configuration commands.\\n\\n.. _second-stage-bootloader:\\n\\nSecond Stage Bootloader\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn ESP-IDF, the binary image which resides at offset {IDF_TARGET_CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_OFFSET_IN_FLASH} in flash is the second stage bootloader. Second stage bootloader source code is available in :idf:`components/bootloader` directory of ESP-IDF. Second stage bootloader is used in ESP-IDF to add flexibility to flash layout (using partition tables), and allow for various flows associated with flash encryption, secure boot, and over-the-air updates (OTA) to take place.\\n\\nWhen the first stage bootloader is finished checking and loading the second stage bootloader, it jumps to the second stage bootloader entry point found in the binary image header.\\n\\nSecond stage bootloader reads the partition table found by default at offset {IDF_TARGET_CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET} (:ref:`configurable value <CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET>`). See :doc:`partition tables <partition-tables>` documentation for more information. The bootloader finds factory and OTA app partitions. If OTA app partitions are found in the partition table, the bootloader consults the ``otadata`` partition to determine which one should be booted. See :doc:`/api-reference/system/ota` for more information.\\n\\nFor a full description of the configuration options available for the ESP-IDF bootloader, see :doc:`bootloader`.\\n\\nFor the selected partition, second stage bootloader reads the binary image from flash one segment at a time:\\n\\n- For segments with load addresses in internal :ref:`iram` or :ref:`dram`, the contents are copied from flash to the load address.\\n- For segments which have load addresses in :ref:`drom` or :ref:`irom` regions, the flash MMU is configured to provide the correct mapping from the flash to the load address.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    Note that the second stage bootloader configures flash MMU for both PRO and APP CPUs, but it only enables flash MMU for PRO CPU. Reason for this is that second stage bootloader code is loaded into the memory region used by APP CPU cache. The duty of enabling cache for APP CPU is passed on to the application.\\n\\nOnce all segments are processed - meaning code is loaded and flash MMU is set up, second stage bootloader verifies the integrity of the application and then jumps to the application entry point found in the binary image header.\\n\\n.. _application-startup:\\n\\nApplication Startup\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nApplication startup covers everything that happens after the app starts executing and before the ``app_main`` function starts running inside the main task. This is split into three stages:\\n\\n- Port initialization of hardware and basic C runtime environment.\\n- System initialization of software services and FreeRTOS.\\n- Running the main task and calling ``app_main``.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   Understanding all stages of ESP-IDF app initialization is often not necessary. To understand initialization from the application developer\\'s perspective only, skip forward to :ref:`app-main-task`.\\n\\nPort Initialization\\n-------------------\\n\\nESP-IDF application entry point is ``call_start_cpu0`` function found in :idf_file:`components/esp_system/port/cpu_start.c`. This function is executed by the second stage bootloader, and never returns.\\n\\nThis port-layer initialization function initializes the basic C Runtime Environment (\"CRT\") and performs initial configuration of the SoC\\'s internal hardware:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n   - Reconfigure CPU exceptions for the app (allowing app interrupt handlers to run, and causing :doc:`fatal-errors` to be handled using the options configured for the app rather than the simpler error handler provided by ROM).\\n   - If the option :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_WDT_ENABLE` is not set then the RTC watchdog timer is disabled.\\n   - Initialize internal memory (data & bss).\\n   - Finish configuring the MMU cache.\\n   :SOC_SPIRAM_SUPPORTED: - Enable PSRAM if configured.\\n   - Set the CPU clocks to the frequencies configured for the project.\\n   :SOC_MEMPROT_SUPPORTED: - Initialize memory protection if configured.\\n   :esp32: - Reconfigure the main SPI flash based on the app header settings (necessary for compatibility with bootloader versions before ESP-IDF V4.0, see :ref:`bootloader-compatibility`).\\n   :SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES: - If the app is configured to run on multiple cores, start the other core and wait for it to initialize as well (inside the similar \"port layer\" initialization function ``call_start_cpu1``).\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES\\n\\n    Once ``call_start_cpu0`` completes running, it calls the \"system layer\" initialization function ``start_cpu0`` found in :idf_file:`components/esp_system/startup.c`. Other cores will also complete port-layer initialization and call ``start_other_cores`` found in the same file.\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES\\n\\n    Once ``call_start_cpu0`` completes running, it calls the \"system layer\" initialization function ``start_cpu0`` found in :idf_file:`components/esp_system/startup.c`.\\n\\nSystem Initialization\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe main system initialization function is ``start_cpu0``. By default, this function is weak-linked to the function ``start_cpu0_default``. This means that it is possible to override this function to add some additional initialization steps.\\n\\nThe primary system initialization stage includes:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n   - Log information about this application (project name, :ref:`app-version`, etc.) if default log level enables this.\\n   - Initialize the heap allocator (before this point all allocations must be static or on the stack).\\n   - Initialize newlib component syscalls and time functions.\\n   - Configure the brownout detector.\\n   - Setup libc stdin, stdout, and stderr according to the :ref:`serial console configuration <CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_UART>`.\\n   :esp32: - Perform any security-related checks, including burning efuses that should be burned for this configuration (including :ref:`disabling ROM download mode on ESP32 V3 <CONFIG_SECURE_UART_ROM_DL_MODE>`, :ref:`CONFIG_ESP32_DISABLE_BASIC_ROM_CONSOLE`).\\n   :not esp32: - Perform any security-related checks, including burning efuses that should be burned for this configuration (including :ref:`permanently limiting ROM download modes <CONFIG_SECURE_UART_ROM_DL_MODE>`).\\n   - Initialize SPI flash API support.\\n   - Call global C++ constructors and any C functions marked with ``__attribute__((constructor))``.\\n\\nSecondary system initialization allows individual components to be initialized. If a component has an initialization function annotated with the ``ESP_SYSTEM_INIT_FN`` macro, it will be called as part of secondary initialization. Component initialization functions have priorities assigned to them to ensure the desired initialization order. The priorities are documented in :component_file:`esp_system/system_init_fn.txt` and ``ESP_SYSTEM_INIT_FN`` definition in source code are checked against this file.\\n\\n.. _app-main-task:\\n\\nRunning the Main Task\\n---------------------\\n\\nAfter all other components are initialized, the main task is created and the FreeRTOS scheduler starts running.\\n\\nAfter doing some more initialization tasks (that require the scheduler to have started), the main task runs the application-provided function ``app_main`` in the firmware.\\n\\nThe main task that runs ``app_main`` has a fixed RTOS priority (one higher than the minimum) and a :ref:`configurable stack size <CONFIG_ESP_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE>`.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES\\n\\n   The main task core affinity is also configurable: :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_MAIN_TASK_AFFINITY`.\\n\\nUnlike normal FreeRTOS tasks (or embedded C ``main`` functions), the ``app_main`` task is allowed to return. If this happens, The task is cleaned up and the system will continue running with other RTOS tasks scheduled normally. Therefore, it is possible to implement ``app_main`` as either a function that creates other application tasks and then returns, or as a main application task itself.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES\\n\\n    Second Core Startup\\n    -------------------\\n\\n    A similar but simpler startup process happens on the APP CPU:\\n\\n    When running system initialization, the code on PRO CPU sets the entry point for APP CPU, de-asserts APP CPU reset, and waits for a global flag to be set by the code running on APP CPU, indicating that it has started. Once this is done, APP CPU jumps to ``call_start_cpu1`` function in :idf_file:`components/esp_system/port/cpu_start.c`.\\n\\n    While PRO CPU does initialization in ``start_cpu0`` function, APP CPU runs ``start_cpu_other_cores`` function. Similar to ``start_cpu0``, this function is weak-linked and defaults to the ``start_cpu_other_cores_default`` function but can be replaced with a different function by the application.\\n\\n    The ``start_cpu_other_cores_default`` function does some core-specific system initialization and then waits for the PRO CPU to start the FreeRTOS scheduler, at which point it executes ``esp_startup_start_app_other_cores`` which is another weak-linked function defaulting to ``esp_startup_start_app_other_cores_default``.\\n\\n    By default ``esp_startup_start_app_other_cores_default`` does nothing but spin in a busy-waiting loop until the scheduler of the PRO CPU triggers an interrupt to start the RTOS scheduler on the APP CPU.\\n',\n",
       " 'Unit Testing in {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\n=================================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nESP-IDF provides the following methods to test software.\\n\\n- Target based tests using a central unit test application which runs on the {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}. These tests use the `Unity <https://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity>`_ unit test framework. They can be integrated into an ESP-IDF component by placing them in the component\\'s ``test`` subdirectory. This document mainly introduces this target based tests.\\n\\n- Linux-host based unit tests in which part of the hardware can be abstracted via mocks. Currently, Linux-host based tests are still under development and only a small fraction of IDF components support them. More information on running IDF applications on the host can be found here: :doc:`Running Applications on the Host Machine <host-apps>`.\\n\\nNormal Test Cases\\n-----------------\\n\\nUnit tests are located in the ``test`` subdirectory of a component. Tests are written in C, and a single C source file can contain multiple test cases. Test files start with the word \"test\".\\n\\nEach test file should include the ``unity.h`` header and the header for the C module to be tested.\\n\\nTests are added in a function in the C file as follows:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    TEST_CASE(\"test name\", \"[module name]\")\\n    {\\n            // Add test here\\n    }\\n\\n- The first argument is a descriptive name for the test.\\n- The second argument is an identifier in square brackets. Identifiers are used to group related test, or tests with specific properties.\\n\\n.. note::\\n    There is no need to add a main function with ``UNITY_BEGIN()`` and ``\\u200bUNITY_END()`` in each test case. ``unity_platform.c`` will run ``UNITY_BEGIN()`` autonomously, and run the test cases, then call ``\\u200bUNITY_END()``.\\n\\nThe ``test`` subdirectory should contain a :ref:`component CMakeLists.txt <component-directories>`, since they are themselves components (i.e., a test component). ESP-IDF uses the Unity test framework located in the ``unity`` component. Thus, each test component should specify the ``unity`` component as a component requirement using the ``REQUIRES`` argument. Normally, components :ref:`should list their sources manually <cmake-file-globbing>`; for component tests however, this requirement is relaxed and the use of the ``SRC_DIRS`` argument in ``idf_component_register`` is advised.\\n\\nOverall, the minimal ``test`` subdirectory ``CMakeLists.txt`` file should contain the following:\\n\\n.. code:: cmake\\n\\n    idf_component_register(SRC_DIRS \".\"\\n                           INCLUDE_DIRS \".\"\\n                           REQUIRES unity)\\n\\nSee http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity for more information about writing tests in Unity.\\n\\n\\nMulti-device Test Cases\\n-----------------------\\n\\nThe normal test cases will be executed on one DUT (Device Under Test). However, components that require some form of communication (e.g., GPIO, SPI) require another device to communicate with, thus cannot be tested through normal test cases. Multi-device test cases involve writing multiple test functions, and running them on multiple DUTs.\\n\\nThe following is an example of a multi-device test case:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    void gpio_master_test()\\n    {\\n        gpio_config_t slave_config = {\\n                .pin_bit_mask = 1 << MASTER_GPIO_PIN,\\n                .mode = GPIO_MODE_INPUT,\\n        };\\n        gpio_config(&slave_config);\\n        unity_wait_for_signal(\"output high level\");\\n        TEST_ASSERT(gpio_get_level(MASTER_GPIO_PIN) == 1);\\n    }\\n\\n    void gpio_slave_test()\\n    {\\n        gpio_config_t master_config = {\\n                .pin_bit_mask = 1 << SLAVE_GPIO_PIN,\\n                .mode = GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT,\\n        };\\n        gpio_config(&master_config);\\n        gpio_set_level(SLAVE_GPIO_PIN, 1);\\n        unity_send_signal(\"output high level\");\\n    }\\n\\n    TEST_CASE_MULTIPLE_DEVICES(\"gpio multiple devices test example\", \"[driver]\", gpio_master_test, gpio_slave_test);\\n\\nThe macro ``TEST_CASE_MULTIPLE_DEVICES`` is used to declare a multi-device test case.\\n\\n- The first argument is test case name.\\n- The second argument is test case description.\\n- From the third argument, up to 5 test functions can be defined, each function will be the entry point of tests running on each DUT.\\n\\nRunning test cases from different DUTs could require synchronizing between DUTs. We provide ``unity_wait_for_signal`` and ``unity_send_signal`` to support synchronizing with UART. As the scenario in the above example, the slave should get GPIO level after master set level. DUT UART console will prompt and user interaction is required:\\n\\nDUT1 (master) console::\\n\\n    Waiting for signal: [output high level]!\\n    Please press \"Enter\" key to once any board send this signal.\\n\\nDUT2 (slave) console::\\n\\n    Send signal: [output high level]!\\n\\nOnce the signal is sent from DUT2, you need to press \"Enter\" on DUT1, then DUT1 unblocks from ``unity_wait_for_signal`` and starts to change GPIO level.\\n\\n\\nMulti-stage Test Cases\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe normal test cases are expected to finish without reset (or only need to check if reset happens). Sometimes we expect to run some specific tests after certain kinds of reset. For example, we want to test if the reset reason is correct after a wake up from deep sleep. We need to create a deep-sleep reset first and then check the reset reason. To support this, we can define multi-stage test cases, to group a set of test functions::\\n\\n    static void trigger_deepsleep(void)\\n    {\\n        esp_sleep_enable_timer_wakeup(2000);\\n        esp_deep_sleep_start();\\n    }\\n\\n    void check_deepsleep_reset_reason()\\n    {\\n        soc_reset_reason_t reason = esp_rom_get_reset_reason(0);\\n        TEST_ASSERT(reason == RESET_REASON_CORE_DEEP_SLEEP);\\n    }\\n\\n    TEST_CASE_MULTIPLE_STAGES(\"reset reason check for deepsleep\", \"[{IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}]\", trigger_deepsleep, check_deepsleep_reset_reason);\\n\\nMulti-stage test cases present a group of test functions to users. It needs user interactions (select cases and select different stages) to run the case.\\n\\nTests For Different Targets\\n---------------------------\\n\\nSome tests (especially those related to hardware) cannot run on all targets. Below is a guide how to make your unit tests run on only specified targets.\\n\\n1. Wrap your test code by ``!(TEMPORARY_)DISABLED_FOR_TARGETS()`` macros and place them either in the original test file, or separate the code into files grouped by functions, but make sure all these files will be processed by the compiler. E.g.::\\n\\n      #if !TEMPORARY_DISABLED_FOR_TARGETS(ESP32, ESP8266)\\n      TEST_CASE(\"a test that is not ready for esp32 and esp8266 yet\", \"[]\")\\n      {\\n      }\\n      #endif //!TEMPORARY_DISABLED_FOR_TARGETS(ESP32, ESP8266)\\n\\nOnce you need one of the tests to be compiled on a specified target, just modify the targets in the disabled list. It\\'s more encouraged to use some general conception that can be described in ``soc_caps.h`` to control the disabling of tests. If this is done but some of the tests are not ready yet, use both of them (and remove ``!(TEMPORARY_)DISABLED_FOR_TARGETS()`` later). E.g.: ::\\n\\n      #if SOC_SDIO_SLAVE_SUPPORTED\\n      #if !TEMPORARY_DISABLED_FOR_TARGETS(ESP64)\\n      TEST_CASE(\"a sdio slave tests that is not ready for esp64 yet\", \"[sdio_slave]\")\\n      {\\n          //available for esp32 now, and will be available for esp64 in the future\\n      }\\n      #endif //!TEMPORARY_DISABLED_FOR_TARGETS(ESP64)\\n      #endif //SOC_SDIO_SLAVE_SUPPORTED\\n\\n2. For test code that you are 100% for sure that will not be supported (e.g., no peripheral at all), use ``DISABLED_FOR_TARGETS``; for test code that should be disabled temporarily, or due to lack of runners, etc., use ``TEMPORARY_DISABLED_FOR_TARGETS``.\\n\\nSome old ways of disabling unit tests for targets, that have obvious disadvantages, are deprecated:\\n\\n- DON\\'T put the test code under ``test/target`` folder and use CMakeLists.txt to choose one of the target folder. This is prevented because test code is more likely to be reused than the implementations. If you put something into ``test/esp32`` just to avoid building it on esp32s2, it\\'s hard to make the code tidy if you want to enable the test again on esp32s3.\\n\\n- DON\\'T use ``CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_xxx`` macros to disable the test items any more. This makes it harder to track disabled tests and enable them again. Also, a black-list style ``#if !disabled`` is preferred to white-list style ``#if CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_xxx``, since you will not silently disable cases when new targets are added in the future. But for test implementations, it\\'s allowed to use ``#if CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_xxx`` to pick one of the implementation code.\\n\\n  - Test item: some items that will be performed on some targets, but skipped on other targets. E.g.\\n\\n    There are three test items SD 1-bit, SD 4-bit and SDSPI. For ESP32-S2, which doesn\\'t have SD host, among the tests only SDSPI is enabled on ESP32-S2.\\n\\n  - Test implementation: some code will always happen, but in different ways. E.g.\\n\\n    There is no SDIO PKT_LEN register on ESP8266. If you want to get the length from the slave as a step in the test process, you can have different implementation code protected by ``#if CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_`` reading in different ways.\\n\\n    But please avoid using ``#else`` macro. When new target is added, the test case will fail at building stage, so that the maintainer will be aware of this, and choose one of the implementations explicitly.\\n\\nBuilding Unit Test App\\n----------------------\\n\\nFollow the setup instructions in the top-level esp-idf README. Make sure that ``IDF_PATH`` environment variable is set to point to the path of esp-idf top-level directory.\\n\\nChange into ``tools/unit-test-app`` directory to configure and build it:\\n\\n* ``idf.py menuconfig`` - configure unit test app.\\n* ``idf.py -T all build`` - build unit test app with tests for each component having tests in the ``test`` subdirectory.\\n* ``idf.py -T \"xxx yyy\" build`` - build unit test app with tests for some space-separated specific components (For instance: ``idf.py -T heap build`` - build unit tests only for ``heap`` component directory).\\n* ``idf.py -T all -E \"xxx yyy\" build`` - build unit test app with all unit tests, except for unit tests of some components (For instance: ``idf.py -T all -E \"ulp mbedtls\" build`` - build all unit tests excludes ``ulp`` and ``mbedtls`` components).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Due to inherent limitations of Windows command prompt, following syntax has to be used in order to build unit-test-app with multiple components: ``idf.py -T xxx -T yyy build`` or with escaped quotes: ``idf.py -T \\\\`\"xxx yyy\\\\`\" build`` in PowerShell or ``idf.py -T \\\\^\"ssd1306 hts221\\\\^\" build`` in Windows command prompt.\\n\\nWhen the build finishes, it will print instructions for flashing the chip. You can simply run ``idf.py flash`` to flash all build output.\\n\\nYou can also run ``idf.py -T all flash`` or ``idf.py -T xxx flash`` to build and flash. Everything needed will be rebuilt automatically before flashing.\\n\\nUse menuconfig to set the serial port for flashing. For more information, see :idf_file:`tools/unit-test-app/README.md`.\\n\\nRunning Unit Tests\\n------------------\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    We also provide the pytest-based framework `pytest-embedded <https://github.com/espressif/pytest-embedded>`_ to help make running unit-tests more convenient and efficient. If you need to run tests in CI or run multiple tests in a row we recommend checking out this project. For more information see `Pytest-embedded Docs <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/pytest-embedded/en/latest/>`_ and :doc:`/contribute/esp-idf-tests-with-pytest`.\\n\\n\\nAfter flashing reset the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} and it will boot the unit test app.\\n\\nWhen unit test app is idle, press \"Enter\" will make it print test menu with all available tests::\\n\\n    Here\\'s the test menu, pick your combo:\\n    (1)     \"esp_ota_begin() verifies arguments\" [ota]\\n    (2)     \"esp_ota_get_next_update_partition logic\" [ota]\\n    (3)     \"Verify bootloader image in flash\" [bootloader_support]\\n    (4)     \"Verify unit test app image\" [bootloader_support]\\n    (5)     \"can use new and delete\" [cxx]\\n    (6)     \"can call virtual functions\" [cxx]\\n    (7)     \"can use static initializers for non-POD types\" [cxx]\\n    (8)     \"can use std::vector\" [cxx]\\n    (9)     \"static initialization guards work as expected\" [cxx]\\n    (10)    \"global initializers run in the correct order\" [cxx]\\n    (11)    \"before scheduler has started, static initializers work correctly\" [cxx]\\n    (12)    \"adc2 work with wifi\" [adc]\\n    (13)    \"gpio master/slave test example\" [ignore][misc][test_env=UT_T2_1][multi_device]\\n            (1)     \"gpio_master_test\"\\n            (2)     \"gpio_slave_test\"\\n    (14)    \"SPI Master clockdiv calculation routines\" [spi]\\n    (15)    \"SPI Master test\" [spi][ignore]\\n    (16)    \"SPI Master test, interaction of multiple devs\" [spi][ignore]\\n    (17)    \"SPI Master no response when switch from host1 (SPI2) to host2 (SPI3)\" [spi]\\n    (18)    \"SPI Master DMA test, TX and RX in different regions\" [spi]\\n    (19)    \"SPI Master DMA test: length, start, not aligned\" [spi]\\n    (20)    \"reset reason check for deepsleep\" [{IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}][test_env=UT_T2_1][multi_stage]\\n            (1)     \"trigger_deepsleep\"\\n            (2)     \"check_deepsleep_reset_reason\"\\n\\nThe normal case will print the case name and description. Master-slave cases will also print the sub-menu (the registered test function names).\\n\\nTest cases can be run by inputting one of the following:\\n\\n- Test case name in quotation marks to run a single test case\\n- Test case index to run a single test case\\n- Module name in square brackets to run all test cases for a specific module\\n- An asterisk to run all test cases\\n\\n``[multi_device]`` and ``[multi_stage]`` tags tell the test runner whether a test case is a multiple devices or multiple stages of test case. These tags are automatically added by ```TEST_CASE_MULTIPLE_STAGES`` and ``TEST_CASE_MULTIPLE_DEVICES`` macros.\\n\\nAfter you select a multi-device test case, it will print sub-menu::\\n\\n    Running gpio master/slave test example...\\n    gpio master/slave test example\\n            (1)     \"gpio_master_test\"\\n            (2)     \"gpio_slave_test\"\\n\\nYou need to input a number to select the test running on the DUT.\\n\\nSimilar to multi-device test cases, multi-stage test cases will also print sub-menu::\\n\\n    Running reset reason check for deepsleep...\\n    reset reason check for deepsleep\\n            (1)     \"trigger_deepsleep\"\\n            (2)     \"check_deepsleep_reset_reason\"\\n\\nFirst time you execute this case, input ``1`` to run first stage (trigger deepsleep). After DUT is rebooted and able to run test cases, select this case again and input ``2`` to run the second stage. The case only passes if the last stage passes and all previous stages trigger reset.\\n\\n\\n.. _cache-compensated-timer:\\n\\nTiming Code with Cache Compensated Timer\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nInstructions and data stored in external memory (e.g., SPI Flash and SPI RAM) are accessed through the CPU\\'s unified instruction and data cache. When code or data is in cache, access is very fast (i.e., a cache hit).\\n\\nHowever, if the instruction or data is not in cache, it needs to be fetched from external memory (i.e., a cache miss). Access to external memory is significantly slower, as the CPU must execute stall cycles whilst waiting for the instruction or data to be retrieved from external memory. This can cause the overall code execution speed to vary depending on the number of cache hits or misses.\\n\\nCode and data placements can vary between builds, and some arrangements may be more favorable with regards to cache access (i.e., minimizing cache misses). This can technically affect execution speed, however these factors are usually irrelevant as their effect \\'average out\\' over the device\\'s operation.\\n\\nThe effect of the cache on execution speed, however, can be relevant in benchmarking scenarios (especially micro benchmarks). There might be some variability in measured time between runs and between different builds. A technique for eliminating for some of the variability is to place code and data in instruction or data RAM (IRAM/DRAM), respectively. The CPU can access IRAM and DRAM directly, eliminating the cache out of the equation. However, this might not always be viable as the size of IRAM and DRAM is limited.\\n\\nThe cache compensated timer is an alternative to placing the code/data to be benchmarked in IRAM/DRAM. This timer uses the processor\\'s internal event counters in order to determine the amount of time spent on waiting for code/data in case of a cache miss, then subtract that from the recorded wall time.\\n\\n  .. code-block:: c\\n\\n    // Start the timer\\n    ccomp_timer_start();\\n\\n    // Function to time\\n    func_code_to_time();\\n\\n    // Stop the timer, and return the elapsed time in microseconds relative to\\n    // ccomp_timer_start\\n    int64_t t = ccomp_timer_stop();\\n\\n\\nOne limitation of the cache compensated timer is that the task that benchmarked functions should be pinned to a core. This is due to each core having its own event counters that are independent of each other. For example, if ``ccomp_timer_start`` gets called on one core, put to sleep by the scheduler, wakes up, and gets rescheduled on the other core, then the corresponding ``ccomp_timer_stop`` will be invalid.\\n\\n.. _mocks:\\n\\nMocks\\n-----\\n\\n.. note::\\n    Currently, mocking is only possible with some selected components when running on the Linux host. In the future, we plan to make essential components in IDF mock-able. This will also include mocking when running on the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.\\n\\nOne of the biggest problems regarding unit testing on embedded systems are the strong hardware dependencies. Running unit tests directly on the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} can be especially difficult for higher layer components for the following reasons:\\n\\n- Decreased test reliability due to lower layer components and/or hardware setup.\\n- Increased difficulty in testing edge cases due to limitations of lower layer components and/or hardware setup\\n- Increased difficulty in identifying the root cause due to the large number of dependencies influencing the behavior\\n\\nWhen testing a particular component, (i.e., the component under test), mocking allows the dependencies of the component under test to be substituted (i.e., mocked) entirely in software. Through mocking, hardware details are emulated and specified at run time, but only if necessary. To allow mocking, ESP-IDF integrates the `CMock <https://www.throwtheswitch.org/cmock>`_ mocking framework as a component. With the addition of some CMake functions in the ESP-IDF build system, it is possible to conveniently mock the entirety (or a part) of an IDF component.\\n\\nIdeally, all components that the component under test is dependent on should be mocked, thus allowing the test environment complete control over all interactions with the component under test. However, if mocking all dependent components becomes too complex or too tedious (e.g., because you need to mock too many function calls) you have the following options:\\n\\n.. list::\\n    - Include more \"real\" IDF code in the tests. This may work but increases the dependency on the \"real\" code\\'s behavior. Furthermore, once a test fails, you may not know if the failure is in your actual code under test or the \"real\" IDF code.\\n    - Re-evaluate the design of the code under test and attempt to reduce its dependencies by dividing the code under test into more manageable components. This may seem burdensome but it is quite common that unit tests expose software design weaknesses. Fixing design weaknesses will not only help with unit testing in the short term, but will help future code maintenance as well.\\n\\nRefer to :component_file:`cmock/CMock/docs/CMock_Summary.md` for more details on how CMock works and how to create and use mocks.\\n\\nRequirements\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nMocking with CMock requires ``Ruby`` on the host machine. Furthermore, since mocking currently only works on the Linux target, the requirements of the latter also need to be fulfilled:\\n\\n.. include:: inc/linux-host-requirements.rst\\n\\nMock a Component\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf a mocked component, called a *component mock*, is already available in ESP-IDF, then it can be used right away as long as it satisfies the required functionality. Refer to :ref:`component-linux-mock-support` to see which components are mocked already. Then refer to :ref:`adjustments_for_mocks` in order to use the component mock.\\n\\nIt is necessary to create component mocks if they are not yet provided in ESP-IDF. To create a component mock, the component needs to be overwritten in a particular way. Overriding a component entails creating a component with the exact same name as the original component, then letting the build system discover it later than the original component (see :ref:`Multiple components with the same name <cmake-components-same-name>` for more details).\\n\\nIn the component mock, the following parts are specified:\\n\\n.. list::\\n    - The headers providing the functions to generate mocks for\\n    - Include paths of the aforementioned headers\\n    - Dependencies of the mock component (this is necessary e.g. if the headers include files from other components)\\n\\nAll these parts have to be specified using the IDF build system function ``idf_component_mock``. You can use the IDF build system function ``idf_component_get_property`` with the tag ``COMPONENT_OVERRIDEN_DIR`` to access the component directory of the original component and then register the mock component parts using ``idf_component_mock``:\\n\\n.. code:: none\\n\\n    idf_component_get_property(original_component_dir <original-component-name> COMPONENT_OVERRIDEN_DIR)\\n    ...\\n    idf_component_mock(INCLUDE_DIRS \"${original_component_dir}/include\"\\n        REQUIRES freertos\\n        MOCK_HEADER_FILES ${original_component_dir}/include/header_containing_functions_to_mock.h)\\n\\nThe component mock also requires a separate ``mock`` directory containing a ``mock_config.yaml`` file that configures CMock. A simple ``mock_config.yaml`` could look like this:\\n\\n  .. code-block:: yaml\\n\\n    :cmock:\\n      :plugins:\\n        - expect\\n        - expect_any_args\\n\\nFor more details about the CMock configuration yaml file, have a look at :component_file:`cmock/CMock/docs/CMock_Summary.md`.\\n\\nNote that the component mock does not have to mock the original component in its entirety. As long as the test project\\'s dependencies and dependencies of other code to the original components are satisfied by the component mock, partial mocking is adequate. In fact, most of the component mocks in IDF in ``tools/mocks`` are only partially mocking the original component.\\n\\nExamples of component mocks can be found under :idf:`tools/mocks` in the IDF directory. General information on how to *override an IDF component* can be found in :ref:`Multiple components with the same name <cmake-components-same-name>`. There are several examples for testing code while mocking dependencies with CMock (non-exhaustive list):\\n\\n- :component_file:`unit test for the NVS Page class <nvs_flash/host_test/nvs_page_test/README.md>`.\\n- :component_file:`unit test for esp_event <esp_event/host_test/esp_event_unit_test/main/esp_event_test.cpp>`.\\n- :component_file:`unit test for mqtt <mqtt/esp-mqtt/host_test/README.md>`.\\n\\n.. _adjustments_for_mocks:\\n\\nAdjustments in Unit Test\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe unit test needs to inform the cmake build system to mock dependent components (i.e., it needs to override the original component with the mock component). This is done by either placing the component mock into the project\\'s ``components`` directory or adding the mock component\\'s directory using the following line in the project\\'s root ``CMakeLists.txt``:\\n\\n  .. code:: cmake\\n\\n    list(APPEND EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS \"<mock_component_dir>\")\\n\\nBoth methods will override existing components in ESP-IDF with the component mock. The latter is particularly convenient if you use component mocks that are already supplied by IDF.\\n\\nUsers can refer to the ``esp_event`` host-based unit test and its :component_file:`esp_event/host_test/esp_event_unit_test/CMakeLists.txt` as an example of a component mock.\\n',\n",
       " 'Wi-Fi Security\\n==============\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi Security Features\\n-----------------------------------------\\n\\n- Support for Protected Management Frames (PMF)\\n- Support for WPA3-Personal\\n- Support for Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE)\\n\\nIn addition to traditional security methods (WEP/WPA-TKIP/WPA2-CCMP), {IDF_TARGET_NAME} Wi-Fi supports state-of-the-art security protocols, namely Protected Management Frames (PMF), Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 and Enhanced Open™ based on Opportunistic Wireless Encryption. WPA3 provides better privacy and robustness against known attacks on traditional modes. Enhanced Open™ enhances the security and privacy of users connecting to open (public) Wireless Networks without authentication.\\n\\nProtected Management Frames (PMF)\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nIntroduction\\n++++++++++++\\n\\nIn Wi-Fi, management frames such as beacons, probes, authentication/deauthentication, and association/disassociation are used by non-AP stations to scan and connect to an AP. Unlike data frames, these frames are sent unencrypted.\\n\\nAn attacker can use eavesdropping and packet injection to send spoofed authentication/deauthentication or association/disassociation frames at the right time, leading to attacks such as Denial-of-Service (DOS) and man-in-the-middle.\\n\\nPMF provides protection against these attacks by encrypting unicast management frames and providing integrity checks for broadcast management frames. These include deauthentication, disassociation, and robust management frames. It also provides a Secure Association (SA) teardown mechanism to prevent spoofed association/authentication frames from disconnecting already connected clients.\\n\\nThere are three types of PMF configuration modes on both the station and AP sides:\\n\\n - PMF Optional\\n - PMF Required\\n - PMF Disabled\\n\\nAPI & Usage\\n+++++++++++\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports PMF in both the station and SoftAP mode. For both, the default mode is PMF Optional. For even higher security, PMF Required mode can be enabled by setting the ``required`` flag in ``pmf_cfg`` while using the :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_set_config` API. This results in the device only connecting to a PMF-enabled device and rejecting others. PMF Optional can be disabled using :cpp:func:`esp_wifi_disable_pmf_config` API. If SoftAP is started in WPA3 or WPA2/WPA3 mixed mode, trying to disable PMF results in an error.\\n\\n.. attention::\\n\\n    ``capable`` flag in ``pmf_cfg`` is deprecated and set to ``true`` internally. This is to take the additional security benefit of PMF whenever possible.\\n\\nWi-Fi Enterprise\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nIntroduction\\n++++++++++++\\n\\nEnterprise security is the secure authentication mechanism for enterprise wireless networks. It uses the RADIUS server for authentication of network users before connecting to the Access Point (AP). The authentication process is based on 802.1X policy and comes with different Extended Authentication Protocol (EAP) methods such as TLS, TTLS, PEAP, and EAP-FAST. RADIUS server authenticates the users based on their credentials (username and password), digital certificates, or both.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports Wi-Fi Enterprise only in station mode.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports **WPA2-Enterprise** and **WPA3-Enterprise**. WPA3-Enterprise builds upon the foundation of WPA2-Enterprise with the additional requirement of using Protected Management Frames (PMF) and server certificate validation on all WPA3 connections. **WPA3-Enterprise also offers an additional secure mode using 192-bit minimum-strength security protocols and cryptographic tools to better protect sensitive data.** The 192-bit security mode offered by WPA3-Enterprise ensures the right combination of cryptographic tools is used and sets a consistent baseline of security within a WPA3 network. WPA3-Enterprise 192-bit mode is only supported by modules having :c:macro:`SOC_WIFI_GCMP_SUPPORT` support. Enable :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_SUITE_B_192` flag to support WPA3-Enterprise with 192-bit mode.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports the following EAP methods:\\n  - EAP-TLS: This is a certificate-based method and only requires SSID and EAP-IDF.\\n  - PEAP: This is a Protected EAP method. Usernames and passwords are mandatory.\\n  - EAP-TTLS: This is a credential-based method. Only server authentication is mandatory while user authentication is optional. Username and Password are mandatory. It supports different Phase2 methods, such as:\\n     - PAP: Password Authentication Protocol.\\n     - CHAP: Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol.\\n     - MSCHAP and MSCHAP-V2.\\n  - EAP-FAST: This is an authentication method based on Protected Access Credentials (PAC) which also uses identity and password. Currently, :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_MBEDTLS_TLS_CLIENT` flag should be disabled to use this feature.\\n\\nExample :example:`wifi/wifi_enterprise` demonstrates all the supported Wi-Fi Enterprise methods except EAP-FAST. Please refer :example:`wifi/wifi_eap_fast` for the EAP-FAST example. EAP method can be selected from the Example Configuration menu in ``idf.py menuconfig``. Refer to :idf_file:`examples/wifi/wifi_enterprise/README.md` for information on how to generate certificates and run the example.\\n\\nWPA3-Personal\\n-------------\\n\\nIntroduction\\n++++++++++++\\n\\nWi-Fi Protected Access-3 (WPA3) is a set of enhancements to Wi-Fi access security intended to replace the current WPA2 standard. It includes new features and capabilities that offer significantly better protection against different types of attacks. It improves upon WPA2-Personal in the following ways:\\n\\n  - WPA3 uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), which is a password-authenticated key agreement method based on Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Unlike WPA2, the technology is resistant to offline-dictionary attacks, where the attacker attempts to determine a shared password based on a captured 4-way handshake without any further network interaction.\\n  - Disallows outdated protocols such as TKIP, which is susceptible to simple attacks like MIC key recovery attacks.\\n  - Mandates Protected Management Frames (PMF), which provides protection for unicast and multicast robust management frames which include Disassoc and Deauth frames. This means that the attacker cannot disrupt an established WPA3 session by sending forged Assoc frames to the AP or Deauth/Disassoc frames to the station.\\n  - Provides forward secrecy, which means the captured data cannot be decrypted even if the password is compromised after data transmission.\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} station also supports following additional Wi-Fi CERTIFIED WPA3™ features:\\n\\n - **Transition Disable** : WPA3 defines transition modes for client devices so that they can connect to a network even when some of the APs in that network do not support the strongest security mode. Client device implementations typically configure network profiles in a transition mode by default. However, such a client device could be subject to an active downgrade attack in which the attacker causes the client device to use a lower security mode in order to exploit a vulnerability with that mode. WPA3 has introduced the Transition Disable feature to mitigate such attacks, by enabling client devices to change from a transition mode to an \"only\" mode when connecting to a network, once that network indicates it fully supports the higher security mode. Enable :cpp:type:`transition_disable` in :cpp:type:`wifi_sta_config_t` to enable this feature for {IDF_TARGET_NAME} station.\\n\\n - **SAE PUBLIC-KEY (PK)** : As the password at small public networks is shared with multiple users, it may be relatively easy for an attacker to find out the password, which is sufficient to launch an evil twin attack. Such attacks are prevented by an extension to WPA3-Personal called SAE-PK. The SAE-PK authentication exchange is very similar to the regular SAE exchange, with the addition of a digital signature sent by the AP to the client device. The client device validates the public key asserted by the AP based on the password fingerprint and verifies the signature using the public key. So even if the attacker knows the password, it does not know the private key to generate a valid signature, and therefore the client device is protected against an evil twin attack. Enable :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_ENABLE_SAE_PK` and :cpp:type:`sae_pk_mode` in :cpp:type:`wifi_sta_config_t` to add support of SAE PK for {IDF_TARGET_NAME} station.\\n\\n - **SAE PWE Methods**: {IDF_TARGET_NAME} station as well as SoftAP supports SAE Password Element derivation method `Hunting And Pecking` and `Hash to Element (H2E)`. H2E is computationally efficient as it uses fewer iterations than Hunt and Peck, and also it mitigates side-channel attacks. These can be configured using the parameter :cpp:type:`sae_pwe_h2e` from :cpp:type:`wifi_sta_config_t` and :cpp:type:`wifi_ap_config_t` for station and SoftAP respectively. Hunt and peck, H2E both can be enabled by using :cpp:enumerator:`WPA3_SAE_PWE_BOTH` configuration.\\n\\nPlease refer to the `Security <https://www.wi-fi.org/discover-wi-fi/security>`_ section of Wi-Fi Alliance\\'s official website for further details.\\n\\nSetting up WPA3 Personal with {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nA configuration option :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_ENABLE_WPA3_SAE` is provided to enable/disable WPA3 for the station. By default, it is kept enabled. If disabled, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} will not be able to establish a WPA3 connection. Also under the Wi-Fi component, a configuration option :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_SOFTAP_SAE_SUPPORT` is provided to enable/disable WPA3 for SoftAP. Additionally, since PMF is mandated by WPA3 protocol, PMF Optional is set by default for station and SoftAP. PMF Required can be configured using Wi-Fi configuration. For WPA3 SoftAP, PMF Required is mandatory and will be configured and stored in NVS implicitly if not specified by the user.\\n\\nRefer to `Protected Management Frames (PMF)`_ on how to set this mode.\\n\\nAfter configuring all required settings for the WPA3-Personal station, application developers need not worry about the underlying security mode of the AP. WPA3-Personal is now the highest supported protocol in terms of security, so it is automatically selected for the connection whenever available. For example, if an AP is configured to be in WPA3 Transition Mode, where it advertises as both WPA2 and WPA3 capable, the station chooses WPA3 for the connection with the above settings.\\n\\nAfter configuring all required setting for WPA3-Personal SoftAP, application developers have to set ``WIFI_AUTH_WPA3_PSK`` for `authmode` in :cpp:type:`wifi_ap_config_t` to start AP in WPA3 security. SoftAP can be also configured to use ``WIFI_AUTH_WPA2_WPA3_PSK`` mixed mode.\\n\\nNote that binary size will be increased by about 6.5 kilobytes after enabling :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_SOFTAP_SAE_SUPPORT`.\\n\\nWi-Fi Enhanced Open™\\n--------------------\\n\\nIntroduction\\n++++++++++++\\n\\nEnhanced Open™ is used for providing security and privacy to users connecting to open (public) wireless networks, particularly in scenarios where user authentication is not desired or distribution of credentials impractical. Each user is provided with unique individual encryption keys that protect data exchange between a user device and the Wi-Fi network. Protected Management Frames further protect management traffic between the access point and the user device. Enhanced Open™ is based on the Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE) standard. OWE Transition Mode enables a seamless transition from Open unencrypted WLANs to OWE WLANs without adversely impacting the end-user experience.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  {IDF_TARGET_NAME} supports Wi-Fi Enhanced Open™ only in station mode.\\n\\n\\nSetting up OWE with {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nA configuration option :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_ENABLE_WPA3_OWE_STA` and configuration parameter :cpp:type:`owe_enabled` in :cpp:type:`wifi_sta_config_t` is provided to enable OWE support for the station. To use OWE transition mode, along with the configuration provided above, `authmode` from :cpp:type:`wifi_scan_threshold_t` should be set to ``WIFI_AUTH_OPEN``.\\n',\n",
       " 'Device Firmware Upgrade via USB\\n===============================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nTypically, the firmware of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is flashed via the chip\\'s serial port. However, flashing via the serial port requires a USB to serial converter chip (e.g., CP210x or FTDI) to be connected to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} (see :doc:`Establish Serial Connection with {IDF_TARGET_NAME} <../get-started/establish-serial-connection>` for more details). The {IDF_TARGET_NAME} contains a USB OTG peripheral making it possible to connect the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} to the host directly via USB (thus not requiring a USB to serial converter chip).\\n\\nDevice Firmware Upgrade (DFU) is a mechanism for upgrading the firmware of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} directly via the Universal Serial Bus (USB). However, enabling Secure Boot or flash encryption disables the USB-OTG USB stack in the ROM, disallowing updates via the serial emulation or DFU on that port.\\n\\n- :ref:`get-started-get-prerequisites` of the Getting Started Guide introduces the software requirements of DFU.\\n- Section :ref:`api_guide_dfu_build` describes how to build firmware for DFU with ESP-IDF.\\n- Section :ref:`api_guide_dfu_flash` deals with flashing the firmware.\\n\\n\\nUSB Connection\\n--------------\\n\\nThe necessary connections for the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s internal USB PHY (transceiver) are shown in the following table:\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n   :widths: 25 20\\n\\n   * - GPIO\\n     - USB\\n\\n   * - 20\\n     - D+ (green)\\n\\n   * - 19\\n     - D- (white)\\n\\n   * - GND\\n     - GND (black)\\n\\n   * - +5V\\n     - +5V (red)\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    Some cables are wired up with non-standard colors and some drivers are able to work with swapped D+ and D- connections. Please try to swap the cables connecting to D+ and D- if your device is not detected.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s3\\n\\n    By default, the :doc:`USB_SERIAL_JTAG <usb-serial-jtag-console>` module is connected to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s internal USB PHY, while the USB OTG peripheral can be used only if an external USB PHY is connected. Since DFU is provided via the USB OTG peripheral, it cannot be used through the internal PHY in this configuration.\\n\\n    However, users can permanently switch the internal USB PHY to work with USB OTG peripheral instead of USB_SERIAL_JTAG by burning the ``USB_PHY_SEL`` eFuse. See *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}>`__] for more details about USB_SERIAL_JTAG and USB OTG.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip needs to be in bootloader mode before it can be detected as a DFU device and flash. This can be achieved by pulling GPIO0 down (e.g., pressing the BOOT button), pulling RESET down for a moment, and releasing GPIO0.\\n\\n\\n.. _api_guide_dfu_build:\\n\\nBuilding the DFU Image\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe command below will create a DFU image named ``dfu.bin`` that is placed in the project\\'s ``build`` directory::\\n\\n    idf.py dfu\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Do not forget to set the target chip by ``idf.py set-target`` before running ``idf.py dfu``. Otherwise, you might create an image for a different chip or receive an error message like ``unknown target \\'dfu\\'``.\\n\\n\\n.. _api_guide_dfu_flash:\\n\\nFlashing the DFU Image\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe command below will download the DFU image into the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}::\\n\\n    idf.py dfu-flash\\n\\nThe command relies on `dfu-util <http://dfu-util.sourceforge.net/>`_. Please see :ref:`get-started-get-prerequisites` for installing ``dfu-util``. ``dfu-util`` needs additional setup for :ref:`api_guide_dfu_flash_win` or setting up an :ref:`api_guide_dfu_flash_udev`. macOS users should be able to use ``dfu-util`` without further setup.\\n\\nIf there are more boards with the same chip connected then ``idf.py dfu-list`` can be used to list the available devices, for example::\\n\\n    Found Runtime: [303a:0002] ver=0723, devnum=4, cfg=1, intf=2, path=\"1-10\", alt=0, name=\"UNKNOWN\", serial=\"0\"\\n    Found Runtime: [303a:0002] ver=0723, devnum=6, cfg=1, intf=2, path=\"1-2\", alt=0, name=\"UNKNOWN\", serial=\"0\"\\n\\nConsequently, the desired device can be selected for flashing by the ``--path`` argument. For example, the devices listed above can be flashed individually by the following commands::\\n\\n    idf.py dfu-flash --path 1-10\\n    idf.py dfu-flash --path 1-2\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The vendor and product identificators are set based on the selected chip target by the ``idf.py set-target`` command and they are not selectable during the ``idf.py dfu-flash`` call.\\n\\nSee :ref:`api_guide_dfu_flash_errors` and their solutions.\\n\\n\\n.. _api_guide_dfu_flash_udev:\\n\\nUdev Rule (Linux Only)\\n----------------------\\n\\nUdev is a device manager for the Linux kernel. It allows us to run ``dfu-util`` (and ``idf.py dfu-flash``) without ``sudo`` for gaining access to the chip.\\n\\nCreate file ``/etc/udev/rules.d/40-dfuse.rules`` with the following content::\\n\\n    SUBSYSTEMS==\"usb\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"303a\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"00??\", GROUP=\"plugdev\", MODE=\"0666\"\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Please check the output of the command ``groups``. The user has to be a member of the `GROUP` specified above. You may use some other existing groups for this purpose (e.g., `uucp` on some systems instead of `plugdev`) or create a new group for this purpose.\\n\\nRestart your computer so the previous setting could take into affect or run ``sudo udevadm trigger`` to force manually udev to trigger your new rule.\\n\\n\\n.. _api_guide_dfu_flash_win:\\n\\nUSB Drivers (Windows Only)\\n--------------------------\\n\\n``dfu-util`` uses `libusb` to access the device.

Please make sure that the device is in download mode before you run the tool and that it detects the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} device before you install the drivers. The Zadig tool might detect several USB interfaces of {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. Please install the WinUSB driver only for the interface where there is no driver installed (probably it is Interface 2) and do not re-install the driver for the other interface.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    The manual installation of the driver in Device Manager of Windows is not recommended because the flashing might not work properly.\\n\\n\\n.. _api_guide_dfu_flash_errors:\\n\\nCommon Errors and Known Issues\\n------------------------------\\n\\n- ``dfu-util: command not found`` might indicate that the tool has not been installed or is not available from the terminal. An easy way of checking the tool is running ``dfu-util --version``. Please see :ref:`get-started-get-prerequisites` for installing ``dfu-util``.\\n\\n- The reason for ``No DFU capable USB device available`` could be that the USB driver was not properly installed on Windows (see :ref:`api_guide_dfu_flash_win`), udev rule was not setup on Linux (see :ref:`api_guide_dfu_flash_udev`) or the device is not in bootloader mode.\\n\\n- Flashing with ``dfu-util`` on Windows fails on the first attempt with error ``Lost device after RESET?``.

       " 'C++ Support\\n===========\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\n.. highlight:: cpp\\n\\nESP-IDF is primarily written in C and provides C APIs. However, ESP-IDF supports development of applications in C++. This document covers various topics relevant to C++ development.\\n\\nThe following C++ features are supported:\\n\\n- :ref:`cplusplus_exceptions`\\n- :ref:`cplusplus_multithreading`\\n- :ref:`cplusplus_rtti`\\n- :doc:`thread-local-storage` (``thread_local`` keyword)\\n- All C++ features implemented by GCC, except for some :ref:`cplusplus_limitations`. See `GCC documentation <https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html>`_ for details on features implemented by GCC.\\n\\n\\n``esp-idf-cxx`` Component\\n-------------------------\\n\\n`esp-idf-cxx <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf-cxx>`_ component provides higher-level C++ APIs for some of the ESP-IDF features. This component is available from the `ESP-IDF Component Registry <https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp-idf-cxx>`_.\\n\\n\\nC++ Language Standard\\n---------------------\\n\\nBy default, ESP-IDF compiles C++ code with C++23 language standard with GNU extensions (``-std=gnu++23``).\\n\\nTo compile the source code of a certain component using a different language standard, set the desired compiler flag in the component\\'s ``CMakeLists.txt`` file:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n    idf_component_register( ... )\\n    target_compile_options(${COMPONENT_LIB} PRIVATE -std=gnu++11)\\n\\nUse ``PUBLIC`` instead of ``PRIVATE`` if the public header files of the component also need to be compiled with the same language standard.\\n\\n\\n.. _cplusplus_multithreading:\\n\\nMultithreading\\n--------------\\n\\nC++ threads, mutexes, and condition variables are supported. C++ threads are built on top of pthreads, which in turn wrap FreeRTOS tasks.\\n\\nSee :example:`cxx/pthread` for an example of creating threads in C++.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The destructor of `std::jthread <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/jthread>`_ can only safely be called from a task that has been created by :ref:`posix_thread_api` or by the `C++ threading library API <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread>`_.\\n\\n\\n.. _cplusplus_exceptions:\\n\\nException Handling\\n------------------\\n\\nSupport for C++ Exceptions in ESP-IDF is disabled by default, but can be enabled using the :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_CXX_EXCEPTIONS` option.\\n\\nIf an exception is thrown, but there is no ``catch`` block, the program is terminated by the ``abort`` function, and the backtrace is printed. See :doc:`fatal-errors` for more information about backtraces.\\n\\nC++ Exceptions should **only** be used for exceptional cases, i.e., something happening unexpectedly and occurs rarely, such as events that happen less frequently than 1/100 times. **Do not** use them for control flow (see also the section about resource usage below). For more information on how to use C++ Exceptions, see the `ISO C++ FAQ <https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/exceptions>`_ and `CPP Core Guidelines <https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-errors>`_.\\n\\nSee :example:`cxx/exceptions` for an example of C++ exception handling.\\n\\n\\nC++ Exception Handling and Resource Usage\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nEnabling exception handling normally increases application binary size by a few KB.\\n\\nAdditionally, it may be necessary to reserve some amount of RAM for the exception emergency memory pool. Memory from this pool is used if it is not possible to allocate an exception object from the heap.\\n\\nThe amount of memory in the emergency pool can be set using the :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_CXX_EXCEPTIONS_EMG_POOL_SIZE` variable.\\n\\nSome additional stack memory (around 200 bytes) is also used if and only if a C++ Exception is actually thrown, because it requires calling some functions from the top of the stack to initiate exception handling.\\n\\nThe run time of code using C++ exceptions depends on what actually happens at run time.\\n\\n- If no exception is thrown, the code tends to be somewhat faster since there is no need to check error codes.\\n- If an exception is thrown, the run time of the code that handles exceptions is orders of magnitude slower than code returning an error code.\\n\\nIf an exception is thrown, the run time of the code that unwinds the stack is orders of magnitude slower than code returning an error code. The significance of the increased run time will depend on the application\\'s requirements and implementation of error handling (e.g., requiring user input or messaging to a cloud). As a result, exception-throwing code should never be used in real-time critical code paths.\\n\\n\\n.. _cplusplus_rtti:\\n\\nRuntime Type Information (RTTI)\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nSupport for RTTI in ESP-IDF is disabled by default, but can be enabled using :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_CXX_RTTI` option.\\n\\nEnabling this option compiles all C++ files with RTTI support enabled, which allows using ``dynamic_cast`` conversion and ``typeid`` operator. Enabling this option typically increases the binary size by tens of kB.\\n\\nSee :example:`cxx/rtti` for an example of using RTTI in ESP-IDF.\\n\\n\\nDeveloping in C++\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe following sections provide tips on developing ESP-IDF applications in C++.\\n\\n\\nCombining C and C++ Code\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen an application is developed using both C and C++, it is important to understand the concept of `language linkage <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/language_linkage>`_.\\n\\nIn order for a C++ function to be callable from C code, it has to be both **declared** and **defined** with C linkage (``extern \"C\"``):\\n\\n.. code-block:: cpp\\n\\n    // declaration in the .h file:\\n    #ifdef __cplusplus\\n    extern \"C\" {\\n    #endif\\n\\n    void my_cpp_func(void);\\n\\n    #ifdef __cplusplus\\n    }\\n    #endif\\n\\n    // definition in a .cpp file:\\n    extern \"C\" void my_cpp_func(void) {\\n        // ...\\n    }\\n\\n\\nIn order for a C function to be callable from C++, it has to be **declared** with C linkage:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    // declaration in .h file:\\n    #ifdef __cplusplus\\n    extern \"C\" {\\n    #endif\\n\\n    void my_c_func(void);\\n\\n    #ifdef __cplusplus\\n    }\\n    #endif\\n\\n    // definition in a .c file:\\n    void my_c_func(void) {\\n        // ...\\n    }\\n\\n\\nDefining ``app_main`` in C++\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-IDF expects the application entry point, ``app_main``, to be defined with C linkage. When ``app_main`` is defined in a .cpp source file, it has to be designated as ``extern \"C\"``:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cpp\\n\\n    extern \"C\" void app_main()\\n    {\\n    }\\n\\n\\n.. _cplusplus_designated_initializers:\\n\\nDesignated Initializers\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nMany of the ESP-IDF components use :ref:`api_reference_config_structures` as arguments to the initialization functions. ESP-IDF examples written in C routinely use `designated initializers <https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/struct_initialization>`_ to fill these structures in a readable and a maintainable way.\\n\\nC and C++ languages have different rules with regards to the designated initializers. For example, C++23 (currently the default in ESP-IDF) does not support out-of-order designated initialization, nested designated initialization, mixing of designated initializers and regular initializers, and designated initialization of arrays. Therefore, when porting ESP-IDF C examples to C++, some changes to the structure initializers may be necessary. See the `C++ aggregate initialization reference <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization>`_ for more details.\\n\\n\\n``iostream``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n``iostream`` functionality is supported in ESP-IDF, with a couple of caveats:\\n\\n1. Normally, ESP-IDF build process eliminates the unused code. However, in the case of iostreams, simply including ``<iostream>`` header in one of the source files significantly increases the binary size by about 200 kB.\\n2. By default, ESP-IDF uses a simple non-blocking implementation of the standard input stream (``stdin``). To get the usual behavior of ``std::cin``, the application has to initialize the UART driver and enable the blocking mode as shown in :example_file:`common_components/protocol_examples_common/stdin_out.c`.\\n\\n\\n.. _cplusplus_limitations:\\n\\nLimitations\\n-----------\\n\\n- Linker script generator does not support function level placements for functions with C++ linkage.\\n- Various section attributes (such as ``IRAM_ATTR``) are ignored when used with template functions.\\n- Vtables are placed into Flash and are not accessible when the flash cache is disabled. Therefore, virtual function calls should be avoided in :ref:`iram-safe-interrupt-handlers`. Placement of Vtables cannot be adjusted using the linker script generator, yet.\\n- C++ filesystem (``std::filesystem``) features are not supported.\\n\\n\\nWhat to Avoid\\n-------------\\n\\nDo not use ``setjmp``/``longjmp`` in C++. ``longjmp`` blindly jumps up the stack without calling any destructors, easily introducing undefined behavior and memory leaks. Use C++ exceptions instead, they guarantee correctly calling destructors. If you cannot use C++ exceptions, use alternatives (except ``setjmp``/``longjmp`` themselves) such as simple return codes.\\n',\n",

This section introduces how to measure the current consumption of a module running such an application.\\n\\n\\nNotes to Measurement\\n--------------------\\n\\nCan We Use a Development Board?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c6\\n\\n    For {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, you can use development boards such as `ESP32-C6-DevKitC-1 <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/espressif-esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32c6/esp32-c6-devkitc-1/index.html>`__ and `ESP32-C6-DevKitM-1 <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/espressif-esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32c6/esp32-c6-devkitm-1/index.html>`__ to measure current consumption of corresponding modules as these development boards are equipped with headers, which can be used to measure current drawn by modules.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32h2\\n\\n    For {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, you can use development boards such as `ESP32-H2-DevKitM-1 <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/espressif-esp-dev-kits/en/latest/esp32h2/esp32-h2-devkitm-1/index.html>`__ to measure current consumption of corresponding modules as these development boards are equipped with headers, which can be used to measure current drawn by modules.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c6 or esp32h2\\n\\n    With such development boards, you can measure current consumption of modules in deep-sleep mode by flashing chips with the :example:`deep_sleep <system/deep_sleep>` example. However, you can also measure current of bare modules equipped with {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip using the following method.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32s2 or esp32s3 or esp32c2 or esp32c3\\n\\n    For {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, using a development board directly to measure current consumption of the corresponding module is not recommended, as some circuits still consume power on the board even when you flash the chip with the :example:`deep_sleep <system/deep_sleep>` example. Therefore, you need to cut off the power supply circuit to the module to measure the module\\'s current. This method is inconvenient and increases measurement costs.\\n\\n\\nHow to Choose an Appropriate Ammeter?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn the :example:`deep_sleep <system/deep_sleep>` example, the module will be woken up every 20 seconds. In deep-sleep mode, the current in the module is just several microamps (μA), while in active mode, the current is in the order of milliamps (mA). The high dynamic current range makes accurate measurement difficult. Ordinary ammeters cannot dynamically switch the measurement range fast enough.\\n\\nAdditionally, ordinary ammeters have a relatively high internal resistance, resulting in a significant voltage drop. This may cause the module to enter an unstable state, as it is powered by a voltage smaller than the minimum required voltage supply.\\n\\nTherefore, an ammeter suitable for measuring current in deep-sleep mode should have low internal resistance and, ideally, switch current ranges dynamically. We recommend two options: the `Joulescope ammeter <https://www.joulescope.com/>`__ and the `Power Profiler Kit II from Nordic <https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Power-Profiler-Kit-2.?lang=en>`__.\\n\\n\\nJoulescope Ammeter\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nThe Joulescope ammeter combines high-speed sampling and rapid dynamic current range switching to provide accurate and seamless current and energy measurements, even for devices with rapidly varying current consumption. Joulescope accurately measures electrical current over nine orders of magnitude from amps down to nanoamps. This wide range allows for accurate and precise current measurements for devices. Additionally, Joulescope has a total voltage drop of 25 mV at 1 A, which keeps the module running normally. These two features make Joulescope a perfect option for measuring the module switching between deep-sleep mode and wake-up mode.\\n\\nJoulescope has no display screen. You need to connect it to a PC to visualize the current waveforms of the measured module. For specific instructions, please follow the documentation provided by the manufacturer.\\n\\n\\nNordic Power Profiler Kit II\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nThe Nordic Power Profiler Kit II has an advanced analog measurement unit with a high dynamic measurement range. This allows for accurate power consumption measurements for the entire range typically seen in low-power embedded applications, all the way from single μAs to 1 A. The resolution varies between 100 nA and 1 mA, depending on the measurement range, and is high enough to detect small spikes often seen in low-power optimized systems.\\n\\n\\nHardware Connection\\n-------------------\\n\\nTo measure the power consumption of a bare module, you need an `ESP-Prog <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/espressif-esp-dev-kits/en/latest/other/esp-prog/user_guide.html>`__ to flash the :example:`deep_sleep <system/deep_sleep>` example to the module and power the module during measurement, a suitable ammeter (here we use the Joulescope ammeter), a computer, and of course a bare module with necessary jumper wires.

Please see the :doc:`ESP-WIFI-MESH API Reference <../api-reference/network/esp-wifi-mesh>` for more information about API usage.\\n\\n.. ------------------------------- Overview -----------------------------------\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nESP-WIFI-MESH is a networking protocol built atop the Wi-Fi protocol. ESP-WIFI-MESH allows numerous devices (henceforth referred to as nodes) spread over a large physical area (both indoors and outdoors) to be interconnected under a single WLAN (Wireless Local-Area Network). ESP-WIFI-MESH is self-organizing and self-healing meaning the network can be built and maintained autonomously.\\n\\nThe ESP-WIFI-MESH guide is split into the following sections:\\n\\n1. :ref:`mesh-introduction`\\n\\n2. :ref:`mesh-concepts`\\n\\n3. :ref:`mesh-building-a-network`\\n\\n4. :ref:`mesh-managing-a-network`\\n\\n5. :ref:`mesh-data-transmission`\\n\\n6. :ref:`mesh-channel-switching`\\n\\n7. :ref:`mesh-network-performance`\\n\\n8. :ref:`mesh-further-notes`\\n\\n\\n.. ----------------------------- Introduction ---------------------------------\\n\\n.. _mesh-introduction:\\n\\nIntroduction\\n------------\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/mesh-traditional-network-architecture.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of Traditional Network Architecture\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Traditional Wi-Fi Network Architecture\\n\\nA traditional infrastructure Wi-Fi network is a point-to-multipoint network where a single central node known as the access point (AP) is directly connected to all other nodes known as stations. The AP is responsible for arbitrating and forwarding transmissions between the stations. Some APs also relay transmissions to/from an external IP network via a router. Traditional infrastructure Wi-Fi networks suffer the disadvantage of limited coverage area due to the requirement that every station must be in range to directly connect with the AP. Furthermore, traditional Wi-Fi networks are susceptible to overloading as the maximum number of stations permitted in the network is limited by the capacity of the AP.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/mesh-esp-wifi-mesh-network-architecture.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of ESP-WIFI-MESH Network Architecture\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-WIFI-MESH Network Architecture\\n\\nESP-WIFI-MESH differs from traditional infrastructure Wi-Fi networks in that nodes are not required to connect to a central node. Instead, nodes are permitted to connect with neighboring nodes. Nodes are mutually responsible for relaying each others transmissions. This allows an ESP-WIFI-MESH network to have much greater coverage area as nodes can still achieve interconnectivity without needing to be in range of the central node. Likewise, ESP-WIFI-MESH is also less susceptible to overloading as the number of nodes permitted on the network is no longer limited by a single central node.\\n\\n\\n.. -------------------------- ESP-WIFI-MESH Concepts -------------------------------\\n\\n.. _mesh-concepts:\\n\\nESP-WIFI-MESH Concepts\\n---------------------------\\n\\nTerminology\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n   :header-rows: 1\\n   :widths: 25 75\\n\\n   * - Term\\n     - Description\\n   * - Node\\n     - Any device that\\xa0**is**\\xa0or\\xa0**can be**\\xa0part of an ESP-WIFI-MESH network\\n   * - Root Node\\n     - The top node in the network\\n   * - Child Node\\n     - A node X is a child node when it is connected to another node Y where the connection makes node X more distant from the root node than node Y (in terms of number of connections).\\n   * - Parent Node\\n     - The converse notion of a child node\\n   * - Descendant Node\\n     - Any node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child\\n   * - Sibling Nodes\\n     - Nodes that share the same parent node\\n   * - Connection\\n     - A traditional Wi-Fi association between an AP and a station.

In Wi-Fi, stations are limited to a single connection with an AP (upstream connection) at any time, whilst an AP can be simultaneously connected to multiple stations (downstream connections). However ESP-WIFI-MESH allows nodes to simultaneously act as a station and an AP. Therefore a node in ESP-WIFI-MESH can have **multiple downstream connections using its softAP interface**, whilst simultaneously having **a single upstream connection using its station interface**. This naturally results in a tree network topology with a parent-child hierarchy consisting of multiple layers.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/mesh-tree-topology.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of ESP-WIFI-MESH Tree Topology\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-WIFI-MESH Tree Topology\\n\\nESP-WIFI-MESH is a multiple hop (multi-hop) network meaning nodes can transmit packets to other nodes in the network through one or more wireless hops. Therefore, nodes in ESP-WIFI-MESH not only transmit their own packets, but simultaneously serve as relays for other nodes. Provided that a path exists between any two nodes on the physical layer (via one or more wireless hops), any pair of nodes within an ESP-WIFI-MESH network can communicate.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The size (total number of nodes) in an ESP-WIFI-MESH network is dependent on the maximum number of layers permitted in the network, and the maximum number of downstream connections each node can have. Both of these variables can be configured to limit the size of the network.\\n\\nNode Types\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/mesh-node-types.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of ESP-WIFI-MESH Node Types\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-WIFI-MESH Node Types\\n\\n**Root Node:** The root node is the top node in the network and serves as the only interface between the ESP-WIFI-MESH network and an external IP network. The root node is connected to a conventional Wi-Fi router and relays packets to/from the external IP network to nodes within the ESP-WIFI-MESH network. **There can only be one root node within an ESP-WIFI-MESH network** and the root node\\'s upstream connection may only be with the router. Referring to the diagram above, node A is the root node of the network.\\n\\n**Leaf Nodes:** A leaf node is a node that is not permitted to have any child nodes (no downstream connections). Therefore a leaf node can only transmit or receive its own packets, but cannot forward the packets of other nodes. If a node is situated on the network\\'s maximum permitted layer, it will be assigned as a leaf node. This prevents the node from forming any downstream connections thus ensuring the network does not add an extra layer. Some nodes without a softAP interface (station only) will also be assigned as leaf nodes due to the requirement of a softAP interface for any downstream connections. Referring to the diagram above, nodes L/M/N are situated on the networks maximum permitted layer hence have been assigned as leaf nodes .\\n\\n**Intermediate Parent Nodes:** Connected nodes that are neither the root node or a leaf node are intermediate parent nodes. An intermediate parent node must have a single upstream connection (a single parent node), but can have zero to multiple downstream connections (zero to multiple child nodes). Therefore an intermediate parent node can transmit and receive packets, but also forward packets sent from its upstream and downstream connections. Referring to the diagram above, nodes B to J are intermediate parent nodes. **Intermediate parent nodes without downstream connections such as nodes E/F/G/I/J are not equivalent to leaf nodes** as they are still permitted to form downstream connections in the future.\\n\\n**Idle Nodes:** Nodes that have yet to join the network are assigned as idle nodes. Idle nodes will attempt to form an upstream connection with an intermediate parent node or attempt to become the root node under the correct circumstances (see `Automatic Root Node Selection`_). Referring to the diagram above, nodes K and O are idle nodes.\\n\\nBeacon Frames & RSSI Thresholding\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nEvery node in ESP-WIFI-MESH that is able to form downstream connections (i.e., has a softAP interface) will periodically transmit Wi-Fi beacon frames. A node uses beacon frames to allow other nodes to detect its presence and know of its status. Idle nodes will listen for beacon frames to generate a list of potential parent nodes, one of which the idle node will form an upstream connection with. ESP-WIFI-MESH uses the Vendor Information Element to store metadata such as:\\n\\n- Node Type (Root, Intermediate Parent, Leaf, Idle)\\n- Current layer of Node\\n- Maximum number of layers permitted in the network\\n- Current number of child nodes\\n- Maximum number of downstream connections to accept\\n\\nThe signal strength of a potential upstream connection is represented by RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) of the beacon frames of the potential parent node. To prevent nodes from forming a weak upstream connection, ESP-WIFI-MESH implements an RSSI threshold mechanism for beacon frames. If a node detects a beacon frame with an RSSI below a preconfigured threshold, the transmitting node will be disregarded when forming an upstream connection.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/mesh-beacon-frame-rssi.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of the Effects of RSSI Thresholding\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Effects of RSSI Thresholding\\n\\n**Panel A** of the illustration above demonstrates how the RSSI threshold affects the number of parent node candidates an idle node has.\\n\\n**Panel B** of the illustration above demonstrates how an RF shielding object can lower the RSSI of a potential parent node. Due to the RF shielding object, the area in which the RSSI of node X is above the threshold is significantly reduced. This causes the idle node to disregard node X even though node X is physically adjacent. The idle node will instead form an upstream connection with the physically distant node Y due to a stronger RSSI.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Nodes technically still receive all beacon frames on the MAC layer. The RSSI threshold is an ESP-WIFI-MESH feature that simply filters out all received beacon frames that are below the preconfigured threshold.\\n\\nPreferred Parent Node\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen an idle node has multiple parent nodes candidates (potential parent nodes), the idle node will form an upstream connection with the **preferred parent node**. The preferred parent node is determined based on the following criteria:\\n\\n- Which layer the parent node candidate is situated on\\n- The number of downstream connections (child nodes) the parent node candidate currently has\\n\\nThe selection of the preferred parent node will always prioritize the parent node candidate on the shallowest layer of the network (including the root node). This helps minimize the total number of layers in an ESP-WIFI-MESH network when upstream connections are formed. For example, given a second layer node and a third layer node, the second layer node will always be preferred.\\n\\nIf there are multiple parent node candidates within the same layer, the parent node candidate with the least child nodes will be preferred. This criteria has the effect of balancing the number of downstream connections amongst nodes of the same layer.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/mesh-preferred-parent-node.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of Preferred Parent Node Selection\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Preferred Parent Node Selection\\n\\n**Panel A** of the illustration above demonstrates an example of how the idle node G selects a preferred parent node given the five parent node candidates B/C/D/E/F. Nodes on the shallowest layer are preferred, hence nodes B/C are prioritized since they are second layer nodes whereas nodes D/E/F are on the third layer. Node C is selected as the preferred parent node due it having fewer downstream connections (fewer child nodes) compared to node B.\\n\\n**Panel B** of the illustration above demonstrates the case where the root node is within range of the idle node G. In other words, the root node\\'s beacon frames are above the RSSI threshold when received by node G. The root node is always the shallowest node in an ESP-WIFI-MESH network hence is always the preferred parent node given multiple parent node candidates.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Users may also define their own algorithm for selecting a preferred parent node, or force a node to only connect with a specific parent node (see the :example:`Mesh Manual Networking Example <mesh/manual_networking>`).\\n\\nRouting Tables\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nEach node within an ESP-WIFI-MESH network will maintain its individual routing table used to correctly route ESP-WIFI-MESH packets (see `ESP-WIFI-MESH Packet`_) to the correct destination node. The routing table of a particular node will **consist of the MAC addresses of all nodes within the particular node\\'s subnetwork** (including the MAC address of the particular node itself). Each routing table is internally partitioned into multiple subtables with each subtable corresponding to the subnetwork of each child node.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/mesh-routing-tables-example.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of ESP-WIFI-MESH Routing Tables Example\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-WIFI-MESH Routing Tables Example\\n\\nUsing the diagram above as an example, the routing table of node B would consist of the MAC addresses of nodes B to I (i.e., equivalent to the subnetwork of node B). Node B\\'s routing table is internally partitioned into two subtables containing of nodes C to F and nodes G to I (i.e., equivalent to the subnetworks of nodes C and G respectively).\\n\\n**ESP-WIFI-MESH utilizes routing tables to determine whether an ESP-WIFI-MESH packet should be forwarded upstream or downstream based on the following rules.**\\n\\n**1.** If the packet\\'s destination MAC address is within the current node\\'s routing table and is not the current node, select the subtable that contains the destination MAC address and forward the data packet downstream to the child node corresponding to the subtable.\\n\\n**2.** If the destination MAC address is not within the current node\\'s routing table, forward the data packet upstream to the current node\\'s parent node. Doing so repeatedly will result in the packet arriving at the root node where the routing table should contain all nodes within the network.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Users can call :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_get_routing_table` to obtain a node\\'s routing table, or :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_get_routing_table_size` to obtain the size of a node\\'s routing table.  :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_get_subnet_nodes_list` can be used to obtain the corresponding subtable of a specific child node. Likewise :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_get_subnet_nodes_num` can be used to obtain the size of the subtable.\\n\\n\\n.. ------------------------ Building a Mesh Network ---------------------------\\n\\n.. _mesh-building-a-network:\\n\\nBuilding a Network\\n------------------\\n\\nGeneral Process\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    Before the ESP-WIFI-MESH network building process can begin, certain parts of the configuration must be uniform across each node in the network (see :cpp:type:`mesh_cfg_t`). Each node must be configured with **the same Mesh Network ID, router configuration, and softAP configuration**.\\n\\nAn ESP-WIFI-MESH network building process involves selecting a root node, then forming downstream connections layer by layer until all nodes have joined the network. The exact layout of the network can be dependent on factors such as root node selection, parent node selection, and asynchronous power-on reset. However, the ESP-WIFI-MESH network building process can be generalized into the following steps:\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/mesh-network-building.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of ESP-WIFI-MESH Network Building Process\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-WIFI-MESH Network Building Process\\n\\n1. Root Node Selection\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\nThe root node can be designated during configuration (see section on `User Designated Root Node`_), or dynamically elected based on the signal strength between each node and the router (see `Automatic Root Node Selection`_). Once selected, the root node will connect with the router and begin allowing downstream connections to form. Referring to the figure above, node A is selected to be the root node hence node A forms an upstream connection with the router.\\n\\n2. Second Layer Formation\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\nOnce the root node has connected to the router, idle nodes in range of the root node will begin connecting with the root node thereby forming the second layer of the network. Once connected, the second layer nodes become intermediate parent nodes (assuming maximum permitted layers > 2) hence the next layer to form. Referring to the figure above, nodes B to D are in range of the root node. Therefore nodes B to D form upstream connections with the root node and become intermediate parent nodes.\\n\\n3. Formation of Remaining Layers\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\nThe remaining idle nodes will connect with intermediate parent nodes within range thereby forming a new layer in the network. Once connected, the idles nodes become intermediate parent node or leaf nodes depending on the networks maximum permitted layers. This step is repeated until there are no more idle nodes within the network or until the maximum permitted layer of the network has been reached. Referring to the figure above, nodes E/F/G connect with nodes B/C/D respectively and become intermediate parent nodes themselves.\\n\\n4. Limiting Tree Depth\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\nTo prevent the network from exceeding the maximum permitted number of layers, nodes on the maximum layer will automatically become leaf nodes once connected. This prevents any other idle node from connecting with the leaf node thereby prevent a new layer form forming. However if an idle node has no other potential parent node, it will remain idle indefinitely. Referring to the figure above, the network\\'s number of maximum permitted layers is set to four. Therefore when node H connects, it becomes a leaf node to prevent any downstream connections from forming.\\n\\nAutomatic Root Node Selection\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe automatic selection of a root node involves an election process amongst all idle nodes based on their signal strengths with the router. Each idle node will transmit their MAC addresses and router RSSI values via Wi-Fi beacon frames. **The MAC address is used to uniquely identify each node in the network** whilst the **router RSSI** is used to indicate a node\\'s signal strength with reference to the router.\\n\\nEach node will then simultaneously scan for the beacon frames from other idle nodes. If a node detects a beacon frame with a stronger router RSSI, the node will begin transmitting the contents of that beacon frame (i.e., voting for the node with the stronger router RSSI). The process of transmission and scanning will repeat for a preconfigured minimum number of iterations (10 iterations by default) and result in the beacon frame with the strongest router RSSI being propagated throughout the network.\\n\\nAfter all iterations, each node will individually check for its **vote percentage** (``number of votes/number of nodes participating in election``) to determine if it should become the root node. **If a node has a vote percentage larger than a preconfigured threshold (90% by default), the node will become a root node**.\\n\\nThe following diagram demonstrates how an ESP-WIFI-MESH network is built when the root node is automatically selected.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/mesh-root-node-election-example.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of Root Node Election Process Example\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Root Node Election Example\\n\\n**1.** On power-on reset, each node begins transmitting beacon frames consisting of their own MAC addresses and their router RSSIs.\\n\\n**2.** Over multiple iterations of transmission and scanning, the beacon frame with the strongest router RSSI is propagated throughout the network. Node C has the strongest router RSSI (-10 dB) hence its beacon frame is propagated throughout the network. All nodes participating in the election vote for node C thus giving node C a vote percentage of 100%. Therefore node C becomes a root node and connects with the router.\\n\\n**3.** Once Node C has connected with the router, nodes A/B/D/E connectwith node C as it is the preferred parent node (i.e., the shallowest node). Nodes A/B/D/E form the second layer of the network.\\n\\n**4.** Node F and G connect with nodes D and E respectively and the network building process is complete.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The minimum number of iterations for the election process can be configured using :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_set_attempts`. Users should adjust the number of iterations based on the number of nodes within the network (i.e., the larger the network the larger number of scan iterations required).\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    **Vote percentage threshold** can also be configured using :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_set_vote_percentage`. Setting a low vote percentage threshold **can result in two or more nodes becoming root nodes** within the same ESP-WIFI-MESH network leading to the building of multiple networks. If such is the case, ESP-WIFI-MESH has internal mechanisms to autonomously resolve the **root node conflict**. The networks of the multiple root nodes will be combined into a single network with a single root node. However, root node conflicts where two or more root nodes have the same router SSID but different router BSSID are not handled.\\n\\nUser Designated Root Node\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe root node can also be designated by user which will entail the designated root node to directly connect with the router and forgo the election process. When a root node is designated, all other nodes within the network must also forgo the election process to prevent the occurrence of a root node conflict. The following diagram demonstrates how an ESP-WIFI-MESH network is built when the root node is designated by the user.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/mesh-root-node-designated-example.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of Root Node Designation Process Example\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Root Node Designation Example (Root Node = A, Max Layers = 4)\\n\\n**1.** Node A is designated the root node by the user therefore directly connects with the router. All other nodes forgo the election process.\\n\\n**2.** Nodes C/D connect with node A as their preferred parent node. Both nodes form the second layer of the network.\\n\\n**3.** Likewise, nodes B/E connect with node C, and node F connects with node D. Nodes B/E/F form the third layer of the network.\\n\\n**4.** Node G connects with node E, forming the fourth layer of the network. However the maximum permitted number of layers in this network is configured as four, therefore node G becomes a leaf node to prevent any new layers from forming.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    When designating a root node, the root node should call :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_set_parent` in order to directly connect with the router. Likewise, all other nodes should call :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_fix_root` to forgo the election process.\\n\\nParent Node Selection\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy default, ESP-WIFI-MESH is self organizing meaning that each node will autonomously select which potential parent node to form an upstream connection with. The autonomously selected parent node is known as the preferred parent node. The criteria used for selecting the preferred parent node is designed to reduce the number of layers in the ESP-WIFI-MESH network and to balance the number of downstream connections between potential parent nodes (see section on `Preferred Parent Node`_).\\n\\nHowever ESP-WIFI-MESH also allows users to disable self-organizing behavior which will allow users to define their own criteria for parent node selection, or to configure nodes to have designated parent nodes (see the :example:`Mesh Manual Networking Example <mesh/manual_networking>`).\\n\\nAsynchronous Power-on Reset\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-WIFI-MESH network building can be affected by the order in which nodes power-on. If certain nodes within the network power-on asynchronously (i.e., separated by several minutes), **the final structure of the network could differ from the ideal case where all nodes are powered on synchronously**. Nodes that are delayed in powering on will adhere to the following rules:\\n\\n**Rule 1:** If a root node already exists in the network, the delayed node will not attempt to elect a new root node, even if it has a stronger RSSI with the router. The delayed node will instead join the network like any other idle node by connecting with a preferred parent node. If the delayed node is the designated root node, all other nodes in the network will remain idle until the delayed node powers-on.\\n\\n**Rule 2:** If a delayed node forms an upstream connection and becomes an intermediate parent node, it may also become the new preferred parent of other nodes (i.e., being a shallower node). This will cause the other nodes to switch their upstream connections to connect with the delayed node (see `Parent Node Switching`_).\\n\\n**Rule 3:** If an idle node has a designated parent node which is delayed in powering-on, the idle node will not attempt to form any upstream connections in the absence of its designated parent node. The idle node will remain idle indefinitely until its designated parent node powers-on.\\n\\nThe following example demonstrates the effects of asynchronous power-on with regards to network building.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/mesh-asynchronous-power-on-example.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of Asynchronous Power On Example\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Network Building with Asynchronous Power On Example\\n\\n**1.** Nodes A/C/D/F/G/H are powered-on synchronously and begin the root node election process by broadcasting their MAC addresses and router RSSIs. Node A is elected as the root node as it has the strongest RSSI.\\n\\n**2.** Once node A becomes the root node, the remaining nodes begin forming upstream connections layer by layer with their preferred parent nodes. The result is a network with five layers.\\n\\n**3.** Node B/E are delayed in powering-on but neither attempt to become the root node even though they have stronger router RSSIs (-20 dB and -10 dB) compared to node A. Instead both delayed nodes form upstream connections with their preferred parent nodes A and C respectively. Both nodes B/E become intermediate parent nodes after connecting.\\n\\n**4.** Nodes D/G switch their upstream connections as node B is the new preferred parent node due to it being on a shallower layer (second layer node). Due to the switch, the resultant network has three layers instead of the original five layers.\\n\\n**Synchronous Power-On:** Had all nodes powered-on synchronously, node E would have become the root node as it has the strongest router RSSI (-10 dB). This would result in a significantly different network layout compared to the network formed under the conditions of asynchronous power-on. **However the synchronous power-on network layout can still be reached if the user manually switches the root node** (see :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_waive_root`).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Differences in parent node selection caused by asynchronous power-on are  autonomously corrected for to some extent in ESP-WIFI-MESH (see `Parent Node Switching`_)\\n\\nLoop-back Avoidance, Detection, and Handling\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nA loop-back is the situation where a particular node forms an upstream connection with one of its descendant nodes (a node within the particular node\\'s subnetwork). This results in a circular connection path thereby breaking the tree topology. ESP-WIFI-MESH prevents loop-back during parent selection by excluding nodes already present in the selecting node\\'s routing table (see `Routing Tables`_) thus prevents a particular node from attempting to connect to any node within its subnetwork.\\n\\nIn the event that a loop-back occurs, ESP-WIFI-MESH utilizes a path verification mechanism and energy transfer mechanism to detect the loop-back occurrence. The parent node of the upstream connection that caused the loop-back will then inform the child node of the loop-back and initiate a disconnection.\\n\\n.. -------------------------- Network Management ------------------------------\\n\\n.. _mesh-managing-a-network:\\n\\nManaging a Network\\n------------------\\n\\n**ESP-WIFI-MESH is a self healing network meaning it can detect and correct for failures in network routing**. Failures occur when a parent node with one or more child nodes breaks down, or when the connection between a parent node and its child nodes becomes unstable. Child nodes in ESP-WIFI-MESH will autonomously select a new parent node and form an upstream connection with it to maintain network interconnectivity. ESP-WIFI-MESH can handle both Root Node Failures and Intermediate Parent Node Failures.\\n\\nRoot Node Failure\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf the root node breaks down, the nodes connected with it (second layer nodes) will promptly detect the failure of the root node. The second layer nodes will initially attempt to reconnect with the root node. However after multiple failed attempts, the second layer nodes will initialize a new round of root node election. **The second layer node with the strongest router RSSI will be elected as the new root node** whilst the remaining second layer nodes will form an upstream connection with the new root node (or a neighboring parent node if not in range).\\n\\nIf the root node and multiple downstream layers simultaneously break down (e.g., root node, second layer, and third layer), the shallowest layer that is still functioning will initialize the root node election. The following example illustrates an example of self healing from a root node break down.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/mesh-root-node-failure.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of Self Healing From Root Node Failure\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Self Healing From Root Node Failure\\n\\n**1.** Node C is the root node of the network. Nodes A/B/D/E are second layer nodes connected to node C.\\n\\n**2.** Node C breaks down. After multiple failed attempts to reconnect, the second layer nodes begin the election process by broadcasting their router RSSIs. Node B has the strongest router RSSI.\\n\\n**3.** Node B is elected as the root node and begins accepting downstream connections. The remaining second layer nodes A/D/E form upstream connections with node B thus the network is healed and can continue operating normally.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    If a designated root node breaks down, the remaining nodes **will not autonomously attempt to elect a new root node** as an election process will never be attempted whilst a designated root node is used.\\n\\nIntermediate Parent Node Failure\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf an intermediate parent node breaks down, the disconnected child nodes will initially attempt to reconnect with the parent node. After multiple failed attempts to reconnect, each child node will begin to scan for potential parent nodes (see `Beacon Frames & RSSI Thresholding`_).\\n\\nIf other potential parent nodes are available, each child node will individually select a new preferred parent node (see `Preferred Parent Node`_) and form an upstream connection with it. If there are no other potential parent nodes for a particular child node, it will remain idle indefinitely.\\n\\nThe following diagram illustrates an example of self healing from an Intermediate Parent Node break down.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/mesh-parent-node-failure.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of Self Healing From Intermediate Parent Node Failure\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Self Healing From Intermediate Parent Node Failure\\n\\n**1.** The following branch of the network consists of nodes A to G.\\n\\n**2.** Node C breaks down. Nodes F/G detect the break down and attempt to reconnect with node C. After multiple failed attempts to reconnect, nodes F/G begin to select a new preferred parent node.\\n\\n**3.** Node G is out of range from any other parent node hence remains idle for the time being. Node F is in range of nodes B/E, however node B is selected as it is the shallower node. Node F becomes an intermediate parent node after connecting with Node B thus node G can connect with node F. The network is healed, however the network routing as been affected and an extra layer has been added.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    If a child node has a designated parent node that breaks down, the child node will make no attempt to connect with a new parent node. The child node will remain idle indefinitely.\\n\\nRoot Node Switching\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-WIFI-MESH does not automatically switch the root node unless the root node breaks down. Even if the root node\\'s router RSSI degrades to the point of disconnection, the root node will remain unchanged. Root node switching is the act of explicitly starting a new election such that a node with a stronger router RSSI will be elected as the new root node. This can be a useful method of adapting to degrading root node performance.\\n\\nTo trigger a root node switch, the current root node must explicitly call :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_waive_root` to trigger a new election. The current root node will signal all nodes within the network to begin transmitting and scanning for beacon frames (see `Automatic Root Node Selection`_) **whilst remaining connected to the network (i.e., not idle)**. If another node receives more votes than the current root node, a root node switch will be initiated. **The root node will remain unchanged otherwise**.\\n\\nA newly elected root node sends a **switch request** to the current root node which in turn will respond with an acknowledgment signifying both nodes are ready to switch. Once the acknowledgment is received, the newly elected root node will disconnect from its parent and promptly form an upstream connection with the router thereby becoming the new root node of the network. The previous root node will disconnect from the router **whilst maintaining all of its downstream connections** and enter the idle state. The previous root node will then begin scanning for potential parent nodes and selecting a preferred parent.\\n\\nThe following diagram illustrates an example of a root node switch.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/mesh-root-node-switch-example.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of Root Node Switch Example\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Root Node Switch Example\\n\\n**1.** Node C is the current root node but has degraded signal strength with the router (-85db). The node C triggers a new election and all nodes begin transmitting and scanning for beacon frames **whilst still being connected**.\\n\\n**2.** After multiple rounds of transmission and scanning, node B is elected as the new root node. Node B sends node C a **switch request** and node C responds with an acknowledgment.\\n\\n**3.** Node B disconnects from its parent and connects with the router becoming the network\\'s new root node. Node C disconnects from the router, enters the idle state, and begins scanning for and selecting a new preferred parent node. **Node C maintains all its downstream connections throughout this process**.\\n\\n**4.** Node C selects node B as its preferred parent node, forms an upstream connection, and becomes a second layer node. The network layout is similar after the switch as node C still maintains the same subnetwork. However each node in node C\\'s subnetwork has been placed one layer deeper as a result of the switch. `Parent Node Switching`_ may adjust the network layout afterwards if any nodes have a new preferred parent node as a result of the root node switch.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Root node switching must require an election hence is only supported when using a self-organized ESP-WIFI-MESH network. In other words, root node switching cannot occur if a designated root node is used.\\n\\nParent Node Switching\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nParent Node Switching entails a child node switching its upstream connection to another parent node of a shallower layer. **Parent Node Switching occurs autonomously** meaning that a child node will change its upstream connection automatically if a potential parent node of a shallower layer becomes available (i.e., due to a `Asynchronous Power-on Reset`_).\\n\\nAll potential parent nodes periodically transmit beacon frames (see `Beacon Frames & RSSI Thresholding`_) allowing for a child node to scan for the availability of a shallower parent node. Due to parent node switching, a self-organized ESP-WIFI-MESH network can dynamically adjust its network layout to ensure each connection has a good RSSI and that the number of layers in the network is minimized.\\n\\n\\n.. --------------------------- Data Transmission ------------------------------\\n\\n.. _mesh-data-transmission:\\n\\nData Transmission\\n-----------------\\n\\nESP-WIFI-MESH Packet\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-WIFI-MESH network data transmissions use ESP-WIFI-MESH packets. ESP-WIFI-MESH packets are **entirely contained within the frame body of a Wi-Fi data frame**. A multi-hop data transmission in an ESP-WIFI-MESH network will involve a single ESP-WIFI-MESH packet being carried over each wireless hop by a different Wi-Fi data frame.\\n\\nThe following diagram shows the structure of an ESP-WIFI-MESH packet and its relation with a Wi-Fi data frame.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/mesh-packet.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of ESP-WIFI-MESH Packet\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-WIFI-MESH Packet\\n\\n**The header** of an ESP-WIFI-MESH packet contains the MAC addresses of the source and destination nodes. The options field contains information pertaining to the special types of ESP-WIFI-MESH packets such as a group transmission or a packet originating from the external IP network (see :c:macro:`MESH_OPT_SEND_GROUP` and :c:macro:`MESH_OPT_RECV_DS_ADDR`).\\n\\n**The payload** of an ESP-WIFI-MESH packet contains the actual application data. This data can be raw binary data, or encoded under an application layer protocol such as HTTP, MQTT, and JSON (see :cpp:type:`mesh_proto_t`).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    When sending an ESP-WIFI-MESH packet to the external IP network, the destination address field of the header will contain the IP address and port of the target server rather than the MAC address of a node (see :cpp:type:`mesh_addr_t`). Furthermore the root node will handle the formation of the outgoing TCP/IP packet.\\n\\nGroup Control & Multicasting\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nMulticasting is a feature that allows a single ESP-WIFI-MESH packet to be transmitted simultaneously to multiple nodes within the network. Multicasting in ESP-WIFI-MESH can be achieved by either specifying a list of target nodes, or specifying a preconfigured group of nodes. Both methods of multicasting are called via :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_send`.\\n\\nTo multicast by specifying a list of target nodes, users must first set the ESP-WIFI-MESH packet\\'s destination address to the **Multicast-Group Address** (``01:00:5E:xx:xx:xx``). This signifies that the ESP-WIFI-MESH packet is a multicast packet with a group of addresses, and that the address should be obtained from the header options. Users must then list the MAC addresses of the target nodes as options (see :cpp:type:`mesh_opt_t` and :c:macro:`MESH_OPT_SEND_GROUP`). This method of multicasting requires no prior setup but can incur a large amount of overhead data as each target node\\'s MAC address must be listed in the options field of the header.\\n\\nMulticasting by group allows a ESP-WIFI-MESH packet to be transmitted to a preconfigured group of nodes. Each grouping is identified by a unique ID, and a node can be placed into a group via :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_set_group_id`. Multicasting to a group involves setting the destination address of the ESP-WIFI-MESH packet to the target group ID. Furthermore, the :c:macro:`MESH_DATA_GROUP` flag must set. Using groups to multicast incurs less overhead, but requires nodes to previously added into groups.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    During a multicast, all nodes within the network still receive the ESP-WIFI-MESH packet on the MAC layer. However, nodes not included in the MAC address list or the target group will simply filter out the packet.\\n\\nBroadcasting\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBroadcasting is a feature that allows a single ESP-WIFI-MESH packet to be transmitted simultaneously to all nodes within the network. Each node essentially forwards a broadcast packet to all of its upstream and downstream connections such that the packet propagates throughout the network as quickly as possible. However, ESP-WIFI-MESH utilizes the following methods to avoid wasting bandwidth during a broadcast.\\n\\n**1.** When an intermediate parent node receives a broadcast packet from its parent, it will forward the packet to each of its child nodes whilst storing a copy of the packet for itself.\\n\\n**2.** When an intermediate parent node is the source node of the broadcast, it will transmit the broadcast packet upstream to is parent node and downstream to each of its child nodes.\\n\\n**3.** When an intermediate parent node receives a broadcast packet from one of its child nodes, it will forward the packet to its parent node and each of its remaining child nodes whilst storing a copy of the packet for itself.\\n\\n**4.** When a leaf node is the source node of a broadcast, it will directly transmit the packet to its parent node.\\n\\n**5.** When the root node is the source node of a broadcast, the root node will transmit the packet to all of its child nodes.\\n\\n**6.** When the root node receives a broadcast packet from one of its child nodes, it will forward the packet to each of its remaining child nodes whilst storing a copy of the packet for itself.\\n\\n**7.** When a node receives a broadcast packet with a source address matching its own MAC address, the node will discard the broadcast packet.\\n\\n**8.** When an intermediate parent node receives a broadcast packet from its parent node which was originally transmitted from one of its child nodes, it will discard the broadcast packet\\n\\nUpstream Flow Control\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-WIFI-MESH relies on parent nodes to control the upstream data flow of their immediate child nodes. To prevent a parent node\\'s message buffer from overflowing due to an overload of upstream transmissions, a parent node will allocate a quota for upstream transmissions known as a **receiving window** for each of its child nodes. **Each child node must apply for a receiving window before it is permitted to transmit upstream**. The size of a receiving window can be dynamically adjusted. An upstream transmission from a child node to the parent node consists of the following steps:\\n\\n**1.** Before each transmission, the child node sends a window request to its parent node. The window request consists of a sequence number which corresponds to the child node\\'s data packet that is pending transmission.\\n\\n**2.** The parent node receives the window request and compares the sequence number with the sequence number of the previous packet sent by the child node. The comparison is used to calculate the size of the receiving window which is transmitted back to the child node.\\n\\n**3.** The child node transmits the data packet in accordance with the window size specified by the parent node. If the child node depletes its receiving window, it must obtain another receiving windows by sending a request before it is permitted to continue transmitting.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    ESP-WIFI-MESH does not support any downstream flow control.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    Due to `Parent Node Switching`_, packet loss may occur during upstream transmissions.\\n\\nDue to the fact that the root node acts as the sole interface to an external IP network, it is critical that downstream nodes are aware of the root node\\'s connection status with the external IP network. Failing to do so can lead to nodes attempting to pass data upstream to the root node whilst it is disconnected from the IP network. This results in unnecessary transmissions and packet loss. ESP-WIFI-MESH address this issue by providing a mechanism to stabilize the throughput of outgoing data based on the connection status between the root node and the external IP network. The root node can broadcast its external IP network connection status to all other nodes by calling :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_post_toDS_state`.\\n\\nBi-Directional Data Stream\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe following diagram illustrates the various network layers involved in an ESP-WIFI-MESH Bidirectional Data Stream.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/mesh-bidirectional-data-stream.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Diagram of ESP-WIFI-MESH Bidirectional Data Stream\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-WIFI-MESH Bidirectional Data Stream\\n\\nDue to the use of `Routing Tables`_, **ESP-WIFI-MESH is able to handle pack forwarding entirely on the mesh layer**. A TCP/IP layer is only required on the root node when it transmits/receives a packet to/from an external IP network.\\n\\n\\n.. --------------------------- Channel Switching -------------------------------\\n\\n.. _mesh-channel-switching:\\n\\nChannel Switching\\n-----------------\\n\\nBackground\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn traditional Wi-Fi networks, **channels** are predetermined frequency ranges. In an infrastructure basic service set (BSS), the serving AP and its connected stations must be on the same operating channels (1 to 14) in which beacons are transmitted. Physically adjacent BSS (Basic Service Sets) operating on the same channel can lead to interference and degraded performance.\\n\\nIn order to allow a BSS adapt to changing physical layer conditions and maintain performance, Wi-Fi contains mechanisms for **network channel switching**. A network channel switch is an attempt to move a BSS to a new operating channel whilst minimizing disruption to the BSS during this process. However it should be recognized that a channel switch may be unsuccessful in  moving all stations to the new operating channel.\\n\\nIn an infrastructure Wi-Fi network, network channel switches are triggered by the AP with the aim of having the AP and all connected stations synchronously switch to a new channel. Network channel switching is implemented by embedding a **Channel Switch Announcement (CSA)** element within the AP\\'s periodically transmitted beacon frames. The CSA element is used to advertise to all connected stations regarding an upcoming network channel switch and will be included in multiple beacon frames up until the switch occurs.\\n\\nA CSA element contains information regarding the **New Channel Number** and a **Channel Switch Count** which indicates the number of beacon frame intervals (TBTTs) remaining until the network channel switch occurs. Therefore, the Channel Switch Count is decremented every beacon frame and allows connected stations to synchronize their channel switch with the AP.\\n\\nESP-WIFI-MESH Network Channel Switching\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-WIFI-MESH Network Channel Switching also utilize beacon frames that contain a CSA element. However, being a multi-hop network makes the switching process in ESP-WIFI-MESH is more complex due to the fact that a beacon frame might not be able to reach all nodes within the network (i.e., in a single hop). Therefore, an ESP-WIFI-MESH network relies on nodes to forward the CSA element so that it is propagated throughout the network.\\n\\nWhen an intermediate parent node with one or more child nodes receives a beacon frame containing a CSA, the node will forward the CSA element by including the element in its next transmitted beacon frame (i.e., with the same **New Channel Number** and **Channel Switch Count**). Given that all nodes within an ESP-WIFI-MESH network receive the same CSA, the nodes can synchronize their channel switches using the Channel Switch Count, albeit with a short delay due to CSA element forwarding.\\n\\nAn ESP-WIFI-MESH network channel switch can be triggered by either the router or the root node.\\n\\nRoot Node Triggered\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n**A root node triggered channel switch can only occur when the ESP-WIFI-MESH network is not connected to a router**. By calling :cpp:func:`esp_mesh_switch_channel`, the root node will set an initial Channel Switch Count value and begin including a CSA element in its beacon frames. Each CSA element is then received by second layer nodes, and forwarded downstream in their own beacon frames.\\n\\nRouter Triggered\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\nWhen an ESP-WIFI-MESH network is connected to a router, the entire network must use the same channel as the router. Therefore, **the root node will not be permitted to trigger a channel switch when it is connected to a router**.\\n\\nWhen the root node receives beacon frame containing a CSA element from the router, **the root node will set Channel Switch Count value in the CSA element to a custom value before forwarding it downstream via beacon frames**. It will also decrement the Channel Switch Count of subsequent CSA elements relative to the custom value. This custom value can be based on factors such as the number of network layers, the current number of nodes etc.\\n\\nThe setting the Channel Switch Count value to a custom value is due to the fact that the ESP-WIFI-MESH network and its router may have a different and varying beacon intervals. Therefore, the Channel Switch Count value provided by the router is irrelevant to an ESP-WIFI-MESH network. By using a custom value, nodes within the ESP-WIFI-MESH network are able to switch channels synchronously relative to the ESP-WIFI-MESH network\\'s beacon interval. However, this will also result in the ESP-WIFI-MESH network\\'s channel switch being unsynchronized with the channel switch of the router and its connected stations.\\n\\nImpact of Network Channel Switching\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n- Due to the ESP-WIFI-MESH network channel switch being unsynchronized with the router\\'s channel switch, there will be a **temporary channel discrepancy** between the ESP-WIFI-MESH network and the router.\\n    - The ESP-WIFI-MESH network\\'s channel switch time is dependent on the ESP-WIFI-MESH network\\'s beacon interval and the root node\\'s custom Channel Switch Count value.\\n    - The channel discrepancy prevents any data exchange between the root node and the router during that ESP-WIFI-MESH network\\'s switch.\\n    - In the ESP-WIFI-MESH network, the root node and intermediate parent nodes will request their connected child nodes to stop transmissions until the channel switch takes place by setting the **Channel Switch Mode** field in the CSA element to 1.\\n    - Frequent router triggered network channel switches can degrade the ESP-WIFI-MESH network\\'s performance. Note that this can be caused by the ESP-WIFI-MESH network itself (e.g., due to wireless medium contention with ESP-WIFI-MESH network). If this is the case, users should disable the automatic channel switching on the router and use a specified channel instead.\\n\\n- When there is a **temporary channel discrepancy**, the root node remains technically connected to the router.\\n    - Disconnection occurs after the root node fails to receive any beacon frames or probe responses from the router over a fixed number of router beacon intervals.\\n    - Upon disconnection, the root node will automatically re-scan all channels for the presence of a router.\\n\\n- If the root node is unable to receive any of the router\\'s CSA beacon frames (e.g., due to short switch time given by the router), the router will switch channels without the ESP-WIFI-MESH network\\'s knowledge.\\n    - After the router switches channels, the root node will no longer be able to receive the router\\'s beacon frames and probe responses and result in a disconnection after a fixed number of beacon intervals.\\n    - The root node will re-scan all channels for the router after disconnection.\\n    - The root node will maintain downstream connections throughout this process.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Although ESP-WIFI-MESH network channel switching aims to move all nodes within the network to a new operating channel, it should be recognized that a channel switch might not successfully move all nodes (e.g., due to reasons such as node failures).\\n\\nChannel and Router Switching Configuration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-WIFI-MESH allows for autonomous channel switching to be enabled/disabled via configuration. Likewise, autonomous router switching (i.e., when a root node autonomously connects to another router) can also be enabled/disabled by configuration. Autonomous channel switching and router switching is dependent on the following configuration parameters and run-time conditions.\\n\\n**Allow Channel Switch:** This parameter is set via the ``allow_channel_switch`` field of the :cpp:type:`mesh_cfg_t` structure and permits an ESP-WIFI-MESH network to dynamically switch channels when set.\\n\\n**Preset Channel:** An ESP-WIFI-MESH network can have a preset channel by setting the ``channel`` field of the :cpp:type:`mesh_cfg_t` structure to the desired channel number. If this field is unset, the ``allow_channel_switch`` parameter is overridden such that channel switches are always permitted.\\n\\n**Allow Router Switch:** This parameter is set via the ``allow_router_switch`` field of the :cpp:type:`mesh_router_t` and permits an ESP-WIFI-MESH to dynamically switch to a different router when set.\\n\\n**Preset Router BSSID:** An ESP-WIFI-MESH network can have a preset router by setting the ``bssid`` field of the :cpp:type:`mesh_router_t` structure to the\\nBSSID of the desired router. If this field is unset, the ``allow_router_switch`` parameter is overridden such that router switches are always permitted.\\n\\n**Root Node Present:** The presence of a root node will can also affect whether or a channel or router switch is permitted.\\n\\nThe following table illustrates how the different combinations of parameters/conditions affect whether channel switching and/or router switching is permitted. Note that `X` represents a \"do not care\" for the parameter.\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :widths: 15 15 15 15 15 15\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Preset Channel\\n      - Allow Channel Switch\\n      - Preset Router BSSID\\n      - Allow Router Switch\\n      - Root Node Present\\n      - Permitted Switches？\\n    * - N\\n      - X\\n      - N\\n      - X\\n      - X\\n      - Channel and Router\\n    * - N\\n      - X\\n      - Y\\n      - N\\n      - X\\n      - Channel Only\\n    * - N\\n      - X\\n      - Y\\n      - Y\\n      - X\\n      - Channel and Router\\n    * - Y\\n      - Y\\n      - N\\n      - X\\n      - X\\n      - Channel and Router\\n    * - Y\\n      - N\\n      - N\\n      - X\\n      - N\\n      - Router Only\\n    * - Y\\n      - N\\n      - N\\n      - X\\n      - Y\\n      - Channel and Router\\n    * - Y\\n      - Y\\n      - Y\\n      - N\\n      - X\\n      - Channel Only\\n    * - Y\\n      - N\\n      - Y\\n      - N\\n      - N\\n      - N\\n    * - Y\\n      - N\\n      - Y\\n      - N\\n      - Y\\n      - Channel Only\\n    * - Y\\n      - Y\\n      - Y\\n      - Y\\n      - X\\n      - Channel and Router\\n    * - Y\\n      - N\\n      - Y\\n      - Y\\n      - N\\n      - Router Only\\n    * - Y\\n      - N\\n      - Y\\n      - Y\\n      - Y\\n      - Channel and Router\\n\\n.. ------------------------------ Performance ---------------------------------\\n\\n.. _mesh-network-performance:\\n\\nPerformance\\n-----------\\n\\nThe performance of an ESP-WIFI-MESH network can be evaluated based on multiple metrics such as the following:\\n\\n**Network Building Time:** The amount of time taken to build an ESP-WIFI-MESH network from scratch.\\n\\n**Healing Time:** The amount of time taken for the network to detect a node break down and carry out appropriate actions to heal the network (such as generating a new root node or forming new connections).\\n\\n**Per-hop latency:** The latency of data transmission over one wireless hop. In other words, the time taken to transmit a data packet from a parent node to a child node or vice versa.\\n\\n**Network Node Capacity:** The total number of nodes the ESP-WIFI-MESH network can simultaneously support. This number is determined by the maximum number of downstream connections a node can accept and the maximum number of layers permissible in the network.\\n\\nThe following table lists the common performance figures of an ESP-WIFI-MESH network:\\n\\n* Network Building Time: < 60 seconds\\n* Healing time:\\n    * Root node break down: < 10 seconds\\n    * Child node break down: < 5 seconds\\n* Per-hop latency: 10 to 30 milliseconds\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The following test conditions were used to generate the performance figures above.\\n\\n    - Number of test devices: **100**\\n    - Maximum Downstream Connections to Accept: **6**\\n    - Maximum Permissible Layers: **6**\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Throughput depends on packet error rate and hop count.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The throughput of root node\\'s access to the external IP network is directly affected by the number of nodes in the ESP-WIFI-MESH network and the bandwidth of the router.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The performance figures can vary greatly between installations based on network configuration and operating environment.\\n\\n.. ----------------------------- Further Notes --------------------------------\\n\\n.. _mesh-further-notes:\\n\\nFurther Notes\\n-------------\\n\\n- Data transmission uses Wi-Fi WPA2-PSK encryption\\n\\n- Mesh networking IE uses AES encryption\\n\\n\\nRouter and internet icon made by `Smashicons <https://smashicons.com>`_ from `www.flaticon.com <https://smashicons.com>`_\\n',\n",

       " '.. highlight:: c\\n\\nError Handling\\n==============\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nIdentifying and handling run-time errors is important for developing robust applications. There can be multiple kinds of run-time errors:\\n\\n- Recoverable errors:\\n\\n  - Errors indicated by functions through return values (error codes)\\n  - C++ exceptions, thrown using ``throw`` keyword\\n\\n- Unrecoverable (fatal) errors:\\n\\n  - Failed assertions (using ``assert`` macro and equivalent methods, see :ref:`assertions`) and ``abort()`` calls.\\n  - CPU exceptions: access to protected regions of memory, illegal instruction, etc.\\n  - System level checks: watchdog timeout, cache access error, stack overflow, stack smashing, heap corruption, etc.\\n\\nThis guide explains ESP-IDF error handling mechanisms related to recoverable errors, and provides some common error handling patterns.\\n\\nFor instructions on diagnosing unrecoverable errors, see :doc:`Fatal Errors <fatal-errors>`.\\n\\n\\nError Codes\\n-----------\\n\\nThe majority of ESP-IDF-specific functions use :cpp:type:`esp_err_t` type to return error codes. :cpp:type:`esp_err_t` is a signed integer type. Success (no error) is indicated with ``ESP_OK`` code, which is defined as zero.\\n\\nVarious ESP-IDF header files define possible error codes using preprocessor defines. Usually these defines start with ``ESP_ERR_`` prefix. Common error codes for generic failures (out of memory, timeout, invalid argument, etc.) are defined in ``esp_err.h`` file. Various components in ESP-IDF may define additional error codes for specific situations.\\n\\nFor the complete list of error codes, see :doc:`Error Code Reference <../api-reference/error-codes>`.\\n\\n\\nConverting Error Codes to Error Messages\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nFor each error code defined in ESP-IDF components, :cpp:type:`esp_err_t` value can be converted to an error code name using :cpp:func:`esp_err_to_name` or :cpp:func:`esp_err_to_name_r` functions. For example, passing ``0x101`` to :cpp:func:`esp_err_to_name` will return \"ESP_ERR_NO_MEM\" string. Such strings can be used in log output to make it easier to understand which error has happened.\\n\\nAdditionally, :cpp:func:`esp_err_to_name_r` function will attempt to interpret the error code as a `standard POSIX error code <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/errno.h.html>`_, if no matching ``ESP_ERR_`` value is found. This is done using ``strerror_r`` function. POSIX error codes (such as ``ENOENT``, ``ENOMEM``) are defined in ``errno.h`` and are typically obtained from ``errno`` variable. In ESP-IDF this variable is thread-local: multiple FreeRTOS tasks have their own copies of ``errno``. Functions which set ``errno`` only modify its value for the task they run in.\\n\\nThis feature is enabled by default, but can be disabled to reduce application binary size. See :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_ERR_TO_NAME_LOOKUP`. When this feature is disabled, :cpp:func:`esp_err_to_name` and :cpp:func:`esp_err_to_name_r` are still defined and can be called. In this case, :cpp:func:`esp_err_to_name` will return ``UNKNOWN ERROR``, and :cpp:func:`esp_err_to_name_r` will return ``Unknown error 0xXXXX(YYYYY)``, where ``0xXXXX`` and ``YYYYY`` are the hexadecimal and decimal representations of the error code, respectively.\\n\\n\\n.. _esp-error-check-macro:\\n\\n``ESP_ERROR_CHECK`` Macro\\n-------------------------\\n\\n:c:macro:`ESP_ERROR_CHECK` macro serves similar purpose as ``assert``, except that it checks :cpp:type:`esp_err_t` value rather than a ``bool`` condition. If the argument of :c:macro:`ESP_ERROR_CHECK` is not equal :c:macro:`ESP_OK`, then an error message is printed on the console, and ``abort()`` is called.\\n\\nError message will typically look like this::\\n\\n    ESP_ERROR_CHECK failed: esp_err_t 0x107 (ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT) at 0x400d1fdf\\n\\n    file: \"/Users/user/esp/example/main/main.c\" line 20\\n    func: app_main\\n    expression: sdmmc_card_init(host, &card)\\n\\n    Backtrace: 0x40086e7c:0x3ffb4ff0 0x40087328:0x3ffb5010 0x400d1fdf:0x3ffb5030 0x400d0816:0x3ffb5050\\n\\n.. note:: If :doc:`ESP-IDF monitor <tools/idf-monitor>` is used, addresses in the backtrace will be converted to file names and line numbers.\\n\\n- The first line mentions the error code as a hexadecimal value, and the identifier used for this error in source code. The latter depends on :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_ERR_TO_NAME_LOOKUP` option being set. Address in the program where error has occured is printed as well.\\n\\n- Subsequent lines show the location in the program where :c:macro:`ESP_ERROR_CHECK` macro was called, and the expression which was passed to the macro as an argument.\\n\\n- Finally, backtrace is printed. This is part of panic handler output common to all fatal errors. See :doc:`Fatal Errors <fatal-errors>` for more information about the backtrace.\\n\\n\\n.. _esp-error-check-without-abort-macro:\\n\\n``ESP_ERROR_CHECK_WITHOUT_ABORT`` Macro\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\n:c:macro:`ESP_ERROR_CHECK_WITHOUT_ABORT` macro serves similar purpose as ``ESP_ERROR_CHECK``, except that it will not call ``abort()``.\\n\\n\\n.. _esp-return-on-error-macro:\\n\\n``ESP_RETURN_ON_ERROR`` Macro\\n-----------------------------\\n\\n:c:macro:`ESP_RETURN_ON_ERROR` macro checks the error code, if the error code is not equal :c:macro:`ESP_OK`, it prints the message and returns.\\n\\n\\n.. _esp-goto-on-error-macro:\\n\\n``ESP_GOTO_ON_ERROR`` Macro\\n---------------------------\\n\\n:c:macro:`ESP_GOTO_ON_ERROR` macro checks the error code, if the error code is not equal :c:macro:`ESP_OK`, it prints the message, sets the local variable `ret` to the code, and then exits by jumping to `goto_tag`.\\n\\n\\n.. _esp-return-on-false-macro:\\n\\n``ESP_RETURN_ON_FALSE`` Macro\\n-----------------------------\\n\\n:c:macro:`ESP_RETURN_ON_FALSE` macro checks the condition, if the condition is not equal `true`, it prints the message and returns with the supplied `err_code`.\\n\\n\\n.. _esp-goto-on-false-macro:\\n\\n``ESP_GOTO_ON_FALSE`` Macro\\n---------------------------\\n\\n:c:macro:`ESP_GOTO_ON_FALSE` macro checks the condition, if the condition is not equal `true`, it prints the message, sets the local variable `ret` to the supplied `err_code`, and then exits by jumping to `goto_tag`.\\n\\n\\n.. _check_macros_examples:\\n\\n``CHECK MACROS Examples``\\n-------------------------\\n\\nSome examples::\\n\\n    static const char* TAG = \"Test\";\\n\\n    esp_err_t test_func(void)\\n    {\\n        esp_err_t ret = ESP_OK;\\n\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK(x);                                         // err message printed if `x` is not `ESP_OK`, and then `abort()`.\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK_WITHOUT_ABORT(x);                           // err message printed if `x` is not `ESP_OK`, without `abort()`.\\n        ESP_RETURN_ON_ERROR(x, TAG, \"fail reason 1\");               // err message printed if `x` is not `ESP_OK`, and then function returns with code `x`.\\n        ESP_GOTO_ON_ERROR(x, err, TAG, \"fail reason 2\");            // err message printed if `x` is not `ESP_OK`, `ret` is set to `x`, and then jumps to `err`.\\n        ESP_RETURN_ON_FALSE(a, err_code, TAG, \"fail reason 3\");     // err message printed if `a` is not `true`, and then function returns with code `err_code`.\\n        ESP_GOTO_ON_FALSE(a, err_code, err, TAG, \"fail reason 4\");  // err message printed if `a` is not `true`, `ret` is set to `err_code`, and then jumps to `err`.\\n\\n    err:\\n        // clean up\\n        return ret;\\n    }\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n     If the option :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_CHECKS_SILENT` in Kconfig is enabled, the err message will be discarded, while the other action works as is.\\n\\n     The ``ESP_RETURN_XX`` and ``ESP_GOTO_xx`` macros cannot be called from ISR. While there are ``xx_ISR`` versions for each of them, e.g., `ESP_RETURN_ON_ERROR_ISR`, these macros could be used in ISR.\\n\\n\\nError Handling Patterns\\n-----------------------\\n\\n1. Attempt to recover. Depending on the situation, we may try the following methods:\\n\\n   - retry the call after some time;\\n   - attempt to de-initialize the driver and re-initialize it again;\\n   - fix the error condition using an out-of-band mechanism (e.g reset an external peripheral which is not responding).\\n\\n   Example::\\n\\n        esp_err_t err;\\n        do {\\n            err = sdio_slave_send_queue(addr, len, arg, timeout);\\n            // keep retrying while the sending queue is full\\n        } while (err == ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT);\\n        if (err != ESP_OK) {\\n            // handle other errors\\n        }\\n\\n2. Propagate the error to the caller. In some middleware components this means that a function must exit with the same error code, making sure any resource allocations are rolled back.\\n\\n   Example::\\n\\n        sdmmc_card_t* card = calloc(1, sizeof(sdmmc_card_t));\\n        if (card == NULL) {\\n            return ESP_ERR_NO_MEM;\\n        }\\n        esp_err_t err = sdmmc_card_init(host, &card);\\n        if (err != ESP_OK) {\\n            // Clean up\\n            free(card);\\n            // Propagate the error to the upper layer (e.g., to notify the user).\\n            // Alternatively, application can define and return custom error code.\\n            return err;\\n        }\\n\\n3. Convert into unrecoverable error, for example using ``ESP_ERROR_CHECK``. See `ESP_ERROR_CHECK macro`_ section for details.\\n\\n   Terminating the application in case of an error is usually undesirable behavior for middleware components, but is sometimes acceptable at application level.\\n\\n   Many ESP-IDF examples use ``ESP_ERROR_CHECK`` to handle errors from various APIs. This is not the best practice for applications, and is done to make example code more concise.\\n\\n   Example::\\n\\n        ESP_ERROR_CHECK(spi_bus_initialize(host, bus_config, dma_chan));\\n\\n\\nC++ Exceptions\\n--------------\\n\\nSee :ref:`cplusplus_exceptions`.\\n',\n",
       " 'Bootloader\\n==========\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThe ESP-IDF Software Bootloader performs the following functions:\\n\\n1. Minimal initial configuration of internal modules;\\n2. Initialize :doc:`/security/flash-encryption` and/or :doc:`Secure </security/secure-boot-v2>` features, if configured;\\n3. Select the application partition to boot, based on the partition table and ota_data (if any);\\n4. Load this image to RAM (IRAM & DRAM) and transfer management to the image that was just loaded.\\n\\nBootloader is located at the address {IDF_TARGET_CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_OFFSET_IN_FLASH} in the flash.\\n\\nFor a full description of the startup process including the ESP-IDF bootloader, see :doc:`startup`.\\n\\n.. _bootloader-compatibility:\\n\\nBootloader Compatibility\\n------------------------\\n\\nIt is recommended to update to newer :doc:`versions of ESP-IDF </versions>`: when they are released. The OTA (over the air) update process can flash new apps in the field but cannot flash a new bootloader. For this reason, the bootloader supports booting apps built from newer versions of ESP-IDF.\\n\\nThe bootloader does not support booting apps from older versions of ESP-IDF. When updating ESP-IDF manually on an existing product that might need to downgrade the app to an older version, keep using the older ESP-IDF bootloader binary as well.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   If testing an OTA update for an existing product in production, always test it using the same ESP-IDF bootloader binary that is deployed in production.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    Before ESP-IDF V2.1\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Bootloaders built from very old versions of ESP-IDF (before ESP-IDF V2.1) perform less hardware configuration than newer versions. When using a bootloader from these early ESP-IDF versions and building a new app, enable the config option :ref:`CONFIG_APP_COMPATIBLE_PRE_V2_1_BOOTLOADERS`.\\n\\n    Before ESP-IDF V3.1\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Bootloaders built from versions of ESP-IDF before V3.1 do not support MD5 checksums in the partition table binary. When using a bootloader from these ESP-IDF versions and building a new app, enable the config option :ref:`CONFIG_APP_COMPATIBLE_PRE_V3_1_BOOTLOADERS`.\\n\\n    Before ESP-IDF V5.1\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Bootloaders built from versions of ESP-IDF prior to V5.1 do not support :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_ESP32_SRAM1_REGION_AS_IRAM`. When using a bootloader from these ESP-IDF versions and building a new app, you should not use this option.\\n\\n\\nSPI Flash Configuration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nEach ESP-IDF application or bootloader .bin file contains a header with :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHMODE`, :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHFREQ`, :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE` embedded in it. These are used to configure the SPI flash during boot.\\n\\nThe :ref:`first-stage-bootloader` in ROM reads the :ref:`second-stage-bootloader` header information from flash and uses this infomation to load the rest of the :ref:`second-stage-bootloader` from flash. However, at this time the system clock speed is lower than configured and not all flash modes are supported. When the :ref:`second-stage-bootloader` then runs, it will reconfigure the flash using values read from the currently selected app binary\\'s header (and NOT from the :ref:`second-stage-bootloader` header). This allows an OTA update to change the SPI flash settings in use.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n   Bootloaders prior to ESP-IDF V4.0 used the bootloader\\'s own header to configure the SPI flash, meaning these values could not be changed in an update. To maintain compatibility with older bootloaders, the app re-initializes the flash settings during app startup using the configuration found in the app header.\\n\\nLog Level\\n---------\\n\\nThe default bootloader log level is \"Info\". By setting the :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_LOG_LEVEL` option, it is possible to increase or decrease this level. This log level is separate from the log level used in the app (see :doc:`/api-reference/system/log`).\\n\\nReducing bootloader log verbosity can improve the overall project boot time by a small amount.\\n\\nFactory Reset\\n-------------\\n\\nSometimes it is desirable to have a way for the device to fall back to a known-good state, in case of some problem with an update.\\n\\nTo roll back to the original \"factory\" device configuration and clear any user settings, configure the config item :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_FACTORY_RESET` in the bootloader.\\n\\nThe factory reset mechanism allows the device to be factory reset in two ways:\\n\\n- Clear one or more data partitions. The :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_DATA_FACTORY_RESET` option allows users to specify which data partitions will be erased when the factory reset is executed.\\n\\n  Users can specify the names of partitions as a comma-delimited list with optional spaces for readability. (Like this: ``nvs, phy_init, nvs_custom``).\\n\\n  Make sure that the names of partitions specified in the option are the same as those found in the partition table. Partitions of type \"app\" cannot be specified here.\\n\\n- Boot from \"factory\" app partition. Enabling the :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_OTA_DATA_ERASE` option will cause the device to boot from the default \"factory\" app partition after a factory reset (or if there is no factory app partition in the partition table then the default ota app partition is selected instead). This reset process involves erasing the OTA data partition which holds the currently selected OTA partition slot. The \"factory\" app partition slot (if it exists) is never updated via OTA, so resetting to this allows reverting to a \"known good\" firmware application.\\n\\nEither or both of these configuration options can be enabled independently.\\n\\nIn addition, the following configuration options control the reset condition:\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_NUM_PIN_FACTORY_RESET`- The input GPIO number used to trigger a factory reset. This GPIO must be pulled low or high (configurable) on reset to trigger this.\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_HOLD_TIME_GPIO`- this is hold time of GPIO for reset/test mode (by default 5 seconds). The GPIO must be held continuously for this period of time after reset before a factory reset or test partition boot (as applicable) is performed.\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_FACTORY_RESET_PIN_LEVEL` - configure whether a factory reset should trigger on a high or low level of the GPIO. If the GPIO has an internal pullup then this is enabled before the pin is sampled, consult the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} datasheet for details on pin internal pullups.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_RTC_FAST_MEM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    If an application needs to know if the factory reset has occurred, users can call the function :cpp:func:`bootloader_common_get_rtc_retain_mem_factory_reset_state`.\\n\\n    - If the status is read as true, the function will return the status, indicating that the factory reset has occurred. The function then resets the status to false for subsequent factory reset judgement.\\n    - If the status is read as false, the function will return the status, indicating that the factory reset has not occurred, or the memory where this status is stored is invalid.\\n\\n    Note that this feature reserves some RTC FAST memory (the same size as the :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_SKIP_VALIDATE_IN_DEEP_SLEEP` feature).\\n\\n.. only:: not SOC_RTC_FAST_MEM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Sometimes an application needs to know if the factory reset has occurred. The {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip does not have RTC FAST memory, so there is no API to detect it. Instead, there is a workaround: you need an NVS partition that will be erased by the bootloader if factory reset occurs (add this partition to :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_DATA_FACTORY_RESET`). In this NVS partition, create a \"factory_reset_state\" token that will be increased in the application. If the \"factory_reset_state\" is 0 then the factory reset has occurred.\\n\\n.. _bootloader_boot_from_test_firmware:\\n\\nBoot from Test Firmware\\n------------------------\\n\\nIt is possible to write a special firmware app for testing in production, and boot this firmware when needed. The project partition table will need a dedicated app partition entry for this testing app, type ``app`` and subtype ``test`` (see :doc:`/api-guides/partition-tables`).\\n\\nImplementing a dedicated test app firmware requires creating a totally separate ESP-IDF project for the test app (each project in ESP-IDF only builds one app). The test app can be developed and tested independently of the main project, and then integrated at production testing time as a pre-compiled .bin file which is flashed to the address of the main project\\'s test app partition.\\n\\nTo support this functionality in the main project\\'s bootloader, set the configuration item :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_TEST` and configure the following three items:\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_NUM_PIN_APP_TEST` - GPIO number to boot test partition. The selected GPIO will be configured as an input with internal pull-up enabled. This GPIO must be pulled low or high (configurable) on reset to trigger this.\\n\\n  Once the GPIO input is released and the device has been rebooted, the default boot sequence will be enabled again to boot the factory partition or any OTA app partition slot.\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_HOLD_TIME_GPIO` - this is the hold time of GPIO for reset/test mode (by default 5 seconds). The GPIO must be held continuously for this period of time after reset before a factory reset or test partition boot (as applicable) is performed.\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_APP_TEST_PIN_LEVEL` - configure whether a test partition boot should trigger on a high or low level of the GPIO. If the GPIO has an internal pull-up, then this is enabled before the pin is sampled. Consult the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} datasheet for details on pin internal pull-ups.\\n\\nRollback\\n--------\\n\\nRollback and anti-rollback features must be configured in the bootloader as well.\\n\\nConsult the :ref:`app_rollback` and :ref:`anti-rollback` sections in the :doc:`OTA API reference document </api-reference/system/ota>`.\\n\\n.. _bootloader-watchdog:\\n\\nWatchdog\\n--------\\n\\nThe chips come equipped with two groups of watchdog timers: Main System Watchdog Timer (MWDT_WDT) and RTC Watchdog Timer (RTC_WDT). Both watchdog timer groups are enabled when the chip is powered up. However, in the bootloader, they will both be disabled. If :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_WDT_ENABLE` is set (which is the default behavior), RTC_WDT is re-enabled. It tracks the time from the bootloader is enabled until the user\\'s main function is called. In this scenario, RTC_WDT remains operational and will automatically reset the chip if no application successfully starts within 9 seconds. This functionality is particularly useful in preventing lockups caused by an unstable power source during startup.\\n\\n- The timeout period can be adjusted by setting :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_WDT_TIME_MS` and recompiling the bootloader.\\n- The RTC Watchdog can be disabled in the bootloader by disabling the :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_WDT_ENABLE` setting and recompiling the bootloader. This is not recommended.\\n- See :ref:`app-hardware-watchdog-timers` to learn how RTC_WDT is used in the application.\\n\\n.. _bootloader-size:\\n\\nBootloader Size\\n---------------\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_MAX_BOOTLOADER_SIZE:default = \"64 KB (0x10000 bytes)\", esp32 = \"48 KB (0xC000 bytes)\"}\\n{IDF_TARGET_MAX_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET:default = \"0x12000\", esp32 = \"0xE000\"}\\n.. Above is calculated as 0x1000 at start of flash + IDF_TARGET_MAX_BOOTLOADER_SIZE + 0x1000 signature sector\\n\\nWhen enabling additional bootloader functions, including :doc:`/security/flash-encryption` or Secure Boot, and especially if setting a high :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_LOG_LEVEL` level, then it is important to monitor the bootloader .bin file\\'s size.\\n\\nWhen using the default :ref:`CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET` value 0x8000, the size limit is {IDF_TARGET_CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET} bytes.\\n\\nIf the bootloader binary is too large, then the bootloader build will fail with an error \"Bootloader binary size [..] is too large for partition table offset\". If the bootloader binary is flashed anyhow then the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} will fail to boot - errors will be logged about either invalid partition table or invalid bootloader checksum.\\n\\nOptions to work around this are:\\n\\n- Set :ref:`bootloader compiler optimization <CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION>` back to \"Size\" if it has been changed from this default value.\\n- Reduce :ref:`bootloader log level <CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_LOG_LEVEL>`. Setting log level to Warning, Error or None all significantly reduce the final binary size (but may make it harder to debug).\\n- Set :ref:`CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET` to a higher value than 0x8000, to place the partition table later in the flash. This increases the space available for the bootloader. If the :doc:`partition table </api-guides/partition-tables>` CSV file contains explicit partition offsets, they will need changing so no partition has an offset lower than ``CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET + 0x1000``. (This includes the default partition CSV files supplied with ESP-IDF.)\\n\\nWhen Secure Boot V2 is enabled, there is also an absolute binary size limit of {IDF_TARGET_MAX_BOOTLOADER_SIZE} (excluding the 4 KB signature), because the bootloader is first loaded into a fixed size buffer for verification.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_RTC_FAST_MEM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Fast Boot from Deep-Sleep\\n    -------------------------\\n\\n    The bootloader has the :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_SKIP_VALIDATE_IN_DEEP_SLEEP` option which allows the wake-up time from Deep-sleep to be reduced (useful for reducing power consumption). This option is available when :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT` option is disabled. Reduction of time is achieved due to the lack of image verification. During the first boot, the bootloader stores the address of the application being launched in the RTC FAST memory. And during the awakening, this address is used for booting without any checks, thus fast loading is achieved.\\n\\nCustom Bootloader\\n-----------------\\n\\nThe current bootloader implementation allows a project to extend it or modify it. There are two ways of doing it: by implementing hooks or by overriding it. Both ways are presented in :example:`custom_bootloader` folder in ESP-IDF examples:\\n\\n* `bootloader_hooks` which presents how to connect some hooks to the bootloader initialization\\n* `bootloader_override` which presents how to override the bootloader implementation\\n\\nIn the bootloader space, you cannot use the drivers and functions from other components. If necessary, then the required functionality should be placed in the project\\'s `bootloader_components` directory (note that this will increase its size).\\n\\nIf the bootloader grows too large then it can collide with the partition table, which is flashed at offset 0x8000 by default. Increase the :ref:`partition table offset <CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET>` value to place the partition table later in the flash. This increases the space available for the bootloader.\\n',\n",
       " \"Anatomy of Core Dump Image\\n--------------------------\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nA core dump file's format can be configured to use the ELF format, or a legacy binary format. The ELF format is recommended for all new designs as it provides more information regarding the software's state at the moment the crash occurs, e.g., CPU registers and memory contents.\\n\\nThe memory state embeds a snapshot of all tasks mapped in the memory space of the program. The CPU state contains register values when the core dump has been generated. The core dump file uses a subset of the ELF structures to register this information.\\n\\nLoadable ELF segments are used to store the process' memory state, while ELF notes (``ELF.PT_NOTE``) are used to store the process' metadata (e.g., PID, registers, signal etc). In particular, the CPU's status is stored in a note with a special name and type (``CORE``, ``NT_PRSTATUS type``).\\n\\nHere is an overview of the core dump layout:\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/core_dump_format_elf.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Core Dump ELF Image Format\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Core Dump ELF Image Format\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/core_dump_format_bin.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Core Dump Binary Image Format\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Core Dump Binary Image Format\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The format of the image file shown in the above pictures represents the current version of the image and can be changed in future releases.\\n\\n\\nOverview of Implementation\\n--------------------------\\n\\nThe figure below describes some basic aspects related to the implementation of the core dump:\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/core_dump_impl.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Core Dump Implementation Overview\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Core Dump Implementation Overview\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The diagram above hides some details and represents the current implementation of the core dump which can be changed later.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Partition Tables\\n================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nA single {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s flash can contain multiple apps, as well as many different kinds of data (calibration data, filesystems, parameter storage, etc). For this reason a partition table is flashed to (:ref:`default offset <CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET>`) 0x8000 in the flash.\\n\\nThe partition table length is 0xC00 bytes, as we allow a maximum of 95 entries. An MD5 checksum, used for checking the integrity of the partition table at runtime, is appended after the table data. Thus, the partition table occupies an entire flash sector, which size is 0x1000 (4 KB). As a result, any partition following it must be at least located at (:ref:`default offset <CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET>`) + 0x1000.\\n\\nEach entry in the partition table has a name (label), type (app, data, or something else), subtype and the offset in flash where the partition is loaded.\\n\\nThe simplest way to use the partition table is to open the project configuration menu (``idf.py menuconfig``) and choose one of the simple predefined partition tables under :ref:`CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_TYPE`:\\n\\n* \"Single factory app, no OTA\"\\n* \"Factory app, two OTA definitions\"\\n\\nIn both cases the factory app is flashed at offset 0x10000. If you execute `idf.py partition-table` then it will print a summary of the partition table.\\n\\nBuilt-in Partition Tables\\n-------------------------\\n\\nHere is the summary printed for the \"Single factory app, no OTA\" configuration::\\n\\n  # ESP-IDF Partition Table\\n  # Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,  Size, Flags\\n  nvs,      data, nvs,     0x9000,  0x6000,\\n  phy_init, data, phy,     0xf000,  0x1000,\\n  factory,  app,  factory, 0x10000, 1M,\\n\\n* At a 0x10000 (64 KB) offset in the flash is the app labelled \"factory\". The bootloader will run this app by default.\\n* There are also two data regions defined in the partition table for storing NVS library partition and PHY init data.\\n\\nHere is the summary printed for the \"Factory app, two OTA definitions\" configuration::\\n\\n  # ESP-IDF Partition Table\\n  # Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,  Size, Flags\\n  nvs,      data, nvs,     0x9000,  0x4000,\\n  otadata,  data, ota,     0xd000,  0x2000,\\n  phy_init, data, phy,     0xf000,  0x1000,\\n  factory,  app,  factory, 0x10000,  1M,\\n  ota_0,    app,  ota_0,   0x110000, 1M,\\n  ota_1,    app,  ota_1,   0x210000, 1M,\\n\\n* There are now three app partition definitions. The type of the factory app (at 0x10000) and the next two \"OTA\" apps are all set to \"app\", but their subtypes are different.\\n* There is also a new \"otadata\" slot, which holds the data for OTA updates. The bootloader consults this data in order to know which app to execute. If \"ota data\" is empty, it will execute the factory app.\\n\\nCreating Custom Tables\\n-------------------------\\n\\nIf you choose \"Custom partition table CSV\" in menuconfig then you can also enter the name of a CSV file (in the project directory) to use for your partition table. The CSV file can describe any number of definitions for the table you need.\\n\\nThe CSV format is the same format as printed in the summaries shown above. However, not all fields are required in the CSV. For example, here is the \"input\" CSV for the OTA partition table::\\n\\n  # Name,   Type, SubType,  Offset,   Size,  Flags\\n  nvs,      data, nvs,      0x9000,  0x4000\\n  otadata,  data, ota,      0xd000,  0x2000\\n  phy_init, data, phy,      0xf000,  0x1000\\n  factory,  app,  factory,  0x10000,  1M\\n  ota_0,    app,  ota_0,    ,         1M\\n  ota_1,    app,  ota_1,    ,         1M\\n  nvs_key,  data, nvs_keys, ,        0x1000\\n\\n* Whitespace between fields is ignored, and so is any line starting with # (comments).\\n* Each non-comment line in the CSV file is a partition definition.\\n* The \"Offset\" field for each partition is empty. The gen_esp32part.py tool fills in each blank offset, starting after the partition table and making sure each partition is aligned correctly.\\n\\nName Field\\n~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nName field can be any meaningful name. It is not significant to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. The maximum length of names is 16 bytes, including one null terminator. Names longer than the maximum length will be truncated.\\n\\nType Field\\n~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nPartition type field can be specified as ``app`` (0x00) or ``data`` (0x01). Or it can be a number 0-254 (or as hex 0x00-0xFE). Types 0x00-0x3F are reserved for ESP-IDF core functions.\\n\\nIf your app needs to store data in a format not already supported by ESP-IDF, then please add a custom partition type value in the range 0x40-0xFE.\\n\\nSee :cpp:type:`esp_partition_type_t` for the enum definitions for ``app`` and ``data`` partitions.\\n\\nIf writing in C++ then specifying a application-defined partition type requires casting an integer to :cpp:type:`esp_partition_type_t` in order to use it with the :ref:`partition API<api-reference-partition-table>`. For example::\\n\\n    static const esp_partition_type_t APP_PARTITION_TYPE_A = (esp_partition_type_t)0x40;\\n\\nThe ESP-IDF bootloader ignores any partition types other than ``app`` (0x00) and ``data`` (0x01).\\n\\nSubType\\n~~~~~~~\\n{IDF_TARGET_ESP_PHY_REF:default = \":ref:`CONFIG_ESP_PHY_INIT_DATA_IN_PARTITION`\", esp32p4, esp32c5=\"NOT UPDATED YET\"}\\n\\nThe 8-bit SubType field is specific to a given partition type. ESP-IDF currently only specifies the meaning of the subtype field for ``app`` and ``data`` partition types.\\n\\nSee enum :cpp:type:`esp_partition_subtype_t` for the full list of subtypes defined by ESP-IDF, including the following:\\n\\n* When type is ``app``, the SubType field can be specified as ``factory`` (0x00), ``ota_0`` (0x10) ... ``ota_15`` (0x1F) or ``test`` (0x20).\\n\\n  - ``factory`` (0x00) is the default app partition. The bootloader will execute the factory app unless there it sees a partition of type data/ota, in which case it reads this partition to determine which OTA image to boot.\\n\\n    - OTA never updates the factory partition.\\n    - If you want to conserve flash usage in an OTA project, you can remove the factory partition and use ``ota_0`` instead.\\n\\n  - ``ota_0`` (0x10) ... ``ota_15`` (0x1F) are the OTA app slots. When :doc:`OTA <../api-reference/system/ota>` is in use, the OTA data partition configures which app slot the bootloader should boot. When using OTA, an application should have at least two OTA application slots (``ota_0`` & ``ota_1``). Refer to the :doc:`OTA documentation <../api-reference/system/ota>` for more details.\\n  - ``test`` (0x20) is a reserved subtype for factory test procedures. It will be used as the fallback boot partition if no other valid app partition is found. It is also possible to configure the bootloader to read a GPIO input during each boot, and boot this partition if the GPIO is held low, see :ref:`bootloader_boot_from_test_firmware`.\\n\\n* When type is ``data``, the subtype field can be specified as ``ota`` (0x00), ``phy`` (0x01), ``nvs`` (0x02), nvs_keys (0x04), or a range of other component-specific subtypes (see :cpp:type:`subtype enum <esp_partition_subtype_t>`).\\n\\n  - ``ota`` (0) is the :ref:`OTA data partition <ota_data_partition>` which stores information about the currently selected OTA app slot. This partition should be 0x2000 bytes in size. Refer to the :ref:`OTA documentation <ota_data_partition>` for more details.\\n  - ``phy`` (1) is for storing PHY initialisation data. This allows PHY to be configured per-device, instead of in firmware.\\n\\n    - In the default configuration, the phy partition is not used and PHY initialisation data is compiled into the app itself. As such, this partition can be removed from the partition table to save space.\\n    - To load PHY data from this partition, open the project configuration menu (``idf.py menuconfig``) and enable {IDF_TARGET_ESP_PHY_REF} option. You will also need to flash your devices with phy init data as the esp-idf build system does not do this automatically.\\n  - ``nvs`` (2) is for the :doc:`Non-Volatile Storage (NVS) API <../api-reference/storage/nvs_flash>`.\\n\\n    - NVS is used to store per-device PHY calibration data (different to initialisation data).\\n\\n    .. only:: SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED\\n\\n        - NVS is used to store Wi-Fi data if the :doc:`esp_wifi_set_storage(WIFI_STORAGE_FLASH) <../api-reference/network/esp_wifi>` initialization function is used.\\n\\n    - The NVS API can also be used for other application data.\\n    - It is strongly recommended that you include an NVS partition of at least 0x3000 bytes in your project.\\n    - If using NVS API to store a lot of data, increase the NVS partition size from the default 0x6000 bytes.\\n  - ``nvs_keys`` (4) is for the NVS key partition. See :doc:`Non-Volatile Storage (NVS) API <../api-reference/storage/nvs_flash>` for more details.\\n\\n    - It is used to store NVS encryption keys when `NVS Encryption` feature is enabled.\\n    - The size of this partition should be 4096 bytes (minimum partition size).\\n\\n  - There are other predefined data subtypes for data storage supported by ESP-IDF. These include:\\n\\n    - ``coredump`` (0x03) is for storing core dumps while using a custom partition table CSV file. See :doc:`/api-guides/core_dump` for more details.\\n    - ``efuse`` (0x05) is for emulating eFuse bits using :ref:`virtual-efuses`.\\n    - ``undefined`` (0x06) is implicitly used for data partitions with unspecified (empty) subtype, but it is possible to explicitly mark them as undefined as well.\\n    - ``fat`` (0x81) is for :doc:`/api-reference/storage/fatfs`.\\n    - ``spiffs`` (0x82) is for :doc:`/api-reference/storage/spiffs`.\\n    - ``littlefs`` (0x83) is for `LittleFS filesystem <https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs>`_. See :example:`storage/littlefs` example for more details.\\n\\n.. Comment: ``esphttpd`` (0x80) was not added to the list because there is no docs section for it and it is not clear whether user should use it explicitly.\\n\\n  Other subtypes of ``data`` type are reserved for future ESP-IDF uses.\\n\\n* If the partition type is any application-defined value (range 0x40-0xFE), then ``subtype`` field can be any value chosen by the application (range 0x00-0xFE).\\n\\n  Note that when writing in C++, an application-defined subtype value requires casting to type :cpp:type:`esp_partition_subtype_t` in order to use it with the :ref:`partition API <api-reference-partition-table>`.\\n\\nExtra Partition SubTypes\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nA component can define a new partition subtype by setting the ``EXTRA_PARTITION_SUBTYPES`` property. This property is a CMake list, each entry of which is a comma separated string with ``<type>, <subtype>, <value>`` format. The build system uses this property to add extra subtypes and creates fields named ``ESP_PARTITION_SUBTYPE_<type>_<subtype>`` in :cpp:type:`esp_partition_subtype_t`. The project can use this subtype to define partitions in the partitions table CSV file and use the new fields in :cpp:type:`esp_partition_subtype_t`.\\n\\n.. _partition-offset-and-size:\\n\\nOffset & Size\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - The offset represents the partition address in the SPI flash, which sector size is 0x1000 (4 KB). Thus, the offset must be a multiple of 4 KB.\\n    - Partitions with blank offsets in the CSV file will start after the previous partition, or after the partition table in the case of the first partition.\\n    - Partitions of type ``app`` have to be placed at offsets aligned to 0x10000 (64 KB). If you leave the offset field blank, ``gen_esp32part.py`` will automatically align the partition. If you specify an unaligned offset for an ``app`` partition, the tool will return an error.\\n    - Partitions of type ``app`` should have the size aligned to the flash sector size (4 KB). If you specify an unaligned size for an ``app`` partition, the tool will return an error.\\n    :SOC_SECURE_BOOT_V1: - If Secure Boot V1 is enabled, then the partition of type ``app`` needs to have size aligned to 0x10000 (64 KB) boundary.\\n    - Sizes and offsets can be specified as decimal numbers, hex numbers with the prefix 0x, or size multipliers K or M (1024 and 1024*1024 bytes).\\n\\nIf you want the partitions in the partition table to work relative to any placement (:ref:`CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_OFFSET`) of the table itself, leave the offset field (in CSV file) for all partitions blank. Similarly, if changing the partition table offset then be aware that all blank partition offsets may change to match, and that any fixed offsets may now collide with the partition table (causing an error).\\n\\nFlags\\n~~~~~\\n\\nTwo flags are currently supported, ``encrypted`` and ``readonly``:\\n\\n  - If ``encrypted`` flag is set, the partition will be encrypted if :doc:`/security/flash-encryption` is enabled.\\n\\n  .. note::\\n\\n      ``app`` type partitions will always be encrypted, regardless of whether this flag is set or not.\\n\\n  - If ``readonly`` flag is set, the partition will be read-only. This flag is only supported for ``data`` type partitions except ``ota``` and ``coredump``` subtypes. This flag can help to protect against accidental writes to a partition that contains critical device-specific configuration data, e.g., factory data partition.\\n\\n  .. note::\\n\\n      Using C file I/O API to open a file (``fopen```) in any write mode (``w``, ``w+``, ``a``, ``a+``, ``r+``) will fail and return ``NULL``. Using ``open`` with any other flag than ``O_RDONLY`` will fail and return ``-1`` while ``errno`` global variable will be set to ``EROFS``. This is also true for any other POSIX syscall function performing write or erase operations. Opening a handle in read-write mode for NVS on a read-only partition will fail and return :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_ALLOWED` error code. Using a lower level API like ``esp_partition``, ``spi_flash``, etc. to write to a read-only partition will result in :c:macro:`ESP_ERR_NOT_ALLOWED` error code.\\n\\nYou can specify multiple flags by separating them with a colon. For example, ``encrypted:readonly``.\\n\\nGenerating Binary Partition Table\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nThe partition table which is flashed to the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is in a binary format, not CSV. The tool :component_file:`partition_table/gen_esp32part.py` is used to convert between CSV and binary formats.\\n\\nIf you configure the partition table CSV name in the project configuration (``idf.py menuconfig``) and then build the project or run ``idf.py partition-table``, this conversion is done as part of the build process.\\n\\nTo convert CSV to Binary manually::\\n\\n  python gen_esp32part.py input_partitions.csv binary_partitions.bin\\n\\nTo convert binary format back to CSV manually::\\n\\n  python gen_esp32part.py binary_partitions.bin input_partitions.csv\\n\\nTo display the contents of a binary partition table on stdout (this is how the summaries displayed when running ``idf.py partition-table`` are generated::\\n\\n  python gen_esp32part.py binary_partitions.bin\\n\\nPartition Size Checks\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe ESP-IDF build system will automatically check if generated binaries fit in the available partition space, and will fail with an error if a binary is too large.\\n\\nCurrently these checks are performed for the following binaries:\\n\\n* Bootloader binary must fit in space before partition table (see :ref:`bootloader-size`).\\n* App binary should fit in at least one partition of type \"app\". If the app binary does not fit in any app partition, the build will fail. If it only fits in some of the app partitions, a warning is printed about this.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   Although the build process will fail if the size check returns an error, the binary files are still generated and can be flashed (although they may not work if they are too large for the available space.)\\n\\nMD5 Checksum\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe binary format of the partition table contains an MD5 checksum computed based on the partition table. This checksum is used for checking the integrity of the partition table during the boot.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    The MD5 checksum generation can be disabled by the ``--disable-md5sum`` option of ``gen_esp32part.py`` or by the :ref:`CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_MD5` option. This is useful for example when one :ref:`uses a bootloader from ESP-IDF before v3.1 <CONFIG_APP_COMPATIBLE_PRE_V3_1_BOOTLOADERS>` which cannot process MD5 checksums and the boot fails with the error message ``invalid magic number 0xebeb``.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n    The MD5 checksum generation can be disabled by the ``--disable-md5sum`` option of ``gen_esp32part.py`` or by the :ref:`CONFIG_PARTITION_TABLE_MD5` option.\\n\\n\\nFlashing the Partition Table\\n----------------------------\\n\\n* ``idf.py partition-table-flash``: will flash the partition table with esptool.py.\\n* ``idf.py flash``: Will flash everything including the partition table.\\n\\nA manual flashing command is also printed as part of ``idf.py partition-table`` output.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  Note that updating the partition table does not erase data that may have been stored according to the old partition table. You can use ``idf.py erase-flash`` (or ``esptool.py erase_flash``) to erase the entire flash contents.\\n\\n\\nPartition Tool (``parttool.py``)\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThe component `partition_table` provides a tool :component_file:`parttool.py <partition_table/parttool.py>` for performing partition-related operations on a target device. The following operations can be performed using the tool:\\n\\n  - reading a partition and saving the contents to a file (read_partition)\\n  - writing the contents of a file to a partition (write_partition)\\n  - erasing a partition (erase_partition)\\n  - retrieving info such as name, offset, size and flag (\"encrypted\") of a given partition (get_partition_info)\\n\\nThe tool can either be imported and used from another Python script or invoked from shell script for users wanting to perform operation programmatically. This is facilitated by the tool\\'s Python API and command-line interface, respectively.\\n\\nPython API\\n~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nBefore anything else, make sure that the `parttool` module is imported.\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n  import sys\\n  import os\\n\\n  idf_path = os.environ[\"IDF_PATH\"]  # get value of IDF_PATH from environment\\n  parttool_dir = os.path.join(idf_path, \"components\", \"partition_table\")  # parttool.py lives in $IDF_PATH/components/partition_table\\n\\n  sys.path.append(parttool_dir)  # this enables Python to find parttool module\\n  from parttool import *  # import all names inside parttool module\\n\\nThe starting point for using the tool\\'s Python API to do is create a `ParttoolTarget` object:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n  # Create a parttool.py target device connected on serial port /dev/ttyUSB1\\n  target = ParttoolTarget(\"/dev/ttyUSB1\")\\n\\nThe created object can now be used to perform operations on the target device:\\n\\n.. code-block:: python\\n\\n  # Erase partition with name \\'storage\\'\\n  target.erase_partition(PartitionName(\"storage\"))\\n\\n  # Read partition with type \\'data\\' and subtype \\'spiffs\\' and save to file \\'spiffs.bin\\'\\n  target.read_partition(PartitionType(\"data\", \"spiffs\"), \"spiffs.bin\")\\n\\n  # Write to partition \\'factory\\' the contents of a file named \\'factory.bin\\'\\n  target.write_partition(PartitionName(\"factory\"), \"factory.bin\")\\n\\n  # Print the size of default boot partition\\n  storage = target.get_partition_info(PARTITION_BOOT_DEFAULT)\\n  print(storage.size)\\n\\nThe partition to operate on is specified using `PartitionName` or `PartitionType` or PARTITION_BOOT_DEFAULT.

       " 'High Priority Interrupts\\n========================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\n.. toctree::\\n   :maxdepth: 1\\n\\nThe Xtensa architecture supports 32 interrupts, divided over 7 priority levels from level 1 to 7, with level 7 being an non-maskable interrupt (NMI), plus an assortment of exceptions. On the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, the :doc:`../api-reference/system/intr_alloc` can route most interrupt sources to these interrupts via the interrupt mux. Normally, interrupts are written in C, but ESP-IDF allows high-priority interrupts to be written in assembly as well, resulting in very low interrupt latencies.\\n\\nInterrupt Priorities\\n--------------------\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n  .. list-table::\\n      :header-rows: 1\\n      :widths: 20 30 50\\n      :align: center\\n\\n      * - Priority Level\\n        - Symbol\\n        - Remark\\n      * - 1\\n        - N/A\\n        - Exception and low priority interrupts, handled by ESP-IDF.\\n      * - 2-3\\n        - N/A\\n        - Medium priority interrupts, handled by ESP-IDF.\\n      * - 4\\n        - xt_highint4\\n        - High priority interrupt, free to use.

Bluetooth\\'s interrupt can be configured to run on priority level 4 by enabling :ref:`CONFIG_BTDM_CTRL_HLI`. If :ref:`CONFIG_BTDM_CTRL_HLI` is enabled, ESP-IDF debug logic must be running on priority level 5 interrupt.\\n  .. [2] If :ref:`CONFIG_BTDM_CTRL_HLI` is enabled, ``xt_debugexception`` is used to fix the `live lock issue <https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/eco_and_workarounds_for_bugs_in_esp32_en.pdf>`_ in ESP32 ECO3.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n  .. list-table::\\n      :header-rows: 1\\n      :widths: 20 30 50\\n      :align: center\\n\\n      * - Priority Level\\n        - Symbol\\n        - Remark\\n      * - 1\\n        - N/A\\n        - Exception and low priority interrupts, handled by ESP-IDF.\\n      * - 2-3\\n        - N/A\\n        - Medium priority interrupts, handled by ESP-IDF.\\n      * - 4\\n        - xt_highint4\\n        - Normally used by ESP-IDF debug logic.\\n      * - 5\\n        - xt_highint5\\n        - High priority interrupts, free to use.\\n      * - NMI\\n        - xt_nmi\\n        - Non-maskable interrupt, free to use.\\n      * - dbg\\n        - xt_debugexception\\n        - Debug exception.

Note that although the panic handler interrupt does call normal C code, this exception is allowed due to the fact that this handler never returns (i.e., the application does not continue to run after the panic handler), so breaking C code execution flow is not a problem.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n  When :ref:`CONFIG_BTDM_CTRL_HLI` is enabled, C code is also called from a high-priority interrupt, this is possible thanks to some additional protection added to it.\\n\\n- Make sure your assembly code gets linked in. Indeed, as the free-to-use symbols are declared as weak, the linker may discard the file containing the symbol. This happens if the only symbol defined, or used from the user file is the ``xt_*`` free-to-use symbol. To avoid this, in the assembly file containing the ``xt_*`` symbol, define another symbol, like:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n  .global ld_include_my_isr_file\\n  ld_include_my_isr_file:\\n\\nHere it is called ``ld_include_my_isr_file`` but can have any name, as long as it is not defined anywhere else in the project.\\n\\nThen, in the component ``CMakeLists.txt``, add this name as an unresolved symbol to the ld command line arguments:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n  target_link_libraries(${COMPONENT_TARGET} \"-u ld_include_my_isr_file\")\\n\\nThis will ensure the linker to always includes the file defining ``ld_include_my_isr_file``, so that the ISR is always linked.\\n\\n- High-priority interrupts can be routed and handled using :cpp:func:`esp_intr_alloc` and associated functions. The handler and handler arguments to :cpp:func:`esp_intr_alloc` must be NULL, however.\\n\\n- In theory, medium priority interrupts could also be handled in this way. ESP-IDF does not support this yet.\\n\\n- To check Xtensa instruction set architecture (ISA), please refer to `Xtensa ISA Summary <https://www.cadence.com/content/dam/cadence-www/global/en_US/documents/tools/ip/tensilica-ip/isa-summary.pdf>`_.\\n',\n",
       " 'lwIP\\n====\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nESP-IDF uses the open source `lwIP lightweight TCP/IP stack`_. The ESP-IDF version of lwIP (`esp-lwip`_) has some modifications and additions compared to the upstream project.\\n\\nSupported APIs\\n--------------\\n\\nESP-IDF supports the following lwIP TCP/IP stack functions:\\n\\n- `BSD Sockets API`_\\n- `Netconn API`_ is enabled but not officially supported for ESP-IDF applications\\n\\n.. _lwip-dns-limitation:\\n\\nAdapted APIs\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    .. warning::\\n\\n        When using any lwIP API other than the `BSD Sockets API`_, please make sure that the API is thread-safe. To check if a given API call is thread-safe, enable the :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_CHECK_THREAD_SAFETY` configuration option and run the application. This enables lwIP to assert the correct access of the TCP/IP core functionality. If the API is not accessed or locked properly from the appropriate `lwIP FreeRTOS Task`_, the execution will be aborted. The general recommendation is to use the :doc:`/api-reference/network/esp_netif` component to interact with lwIP.\\n\\nSome common lwIP app APIs are supported indirectly by ESP-IDF:\\n\\n- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) Server & Client are supported indirectly via the :doc:`/api-reference/network/esp_netif` functionality.\\n- Domain Name System (DNS) is supported in lwIP; DNS servers could be assigned automatically when acquiring a DHCP address, or manually configured using the :doc:`/api-reference/network/esp_netif` API.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    DNS server configuration in lwIP is global, not interface-specific. If you are using multiple network interfaces with distinct DNS servers, exercise caution to prevent inadvertent overwrites of one interface\\'s DNS settings when acquiring a DHCP lease from another interface.\\n\\n- Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP) is also supported via the :doc:`/api-reference/network/esp_netif`, or directly via the :component_file:`lwip/include/apps/esp_sntp.h` functions, which also provide thread-safe API to :component_file:`lwip/lwip/src/include/lwip/apps/sntp.h` functions, see also :ref:`system-time-sntp-sync`.\\n- ICMP Ping is supported using a variation on the lwIP ping API, see :doc:`/api-reference/protocols/icmp_echo`.\\n- ICMPv6 Ping, supported by lwIP\\'s ICMPv6 Echo API, is used to test IPv6 network connectivity. For more information, see :example:`protocols/sockets/icmpv6_ping`.\\n- NetBIOS lookup is available using the standard lwIP API. :example:`protocols/http_server/restful_server` has the option to demonstrate using NetBIOS to look up a host on the LAN.\\n- mDNS uses a different implementation to the lwIP default mDNS, see :doc:`/api-reference/protocols/mdns`. But lwIP can look up mDNS hosts using standard APIs such as ``gethostbyname()`` and the convention ``hostname.local``, provided the :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_DNS_SUPPORT_MDNS_QUERIES` setting is enabled.\\n- The PPP implementation in lwIP can be used to create PPPoS (PPP over serial) interface in ESP-IDF. Please refer to the documentation of the :doc:`/api-reference/network/esp_netif` component to create and configure a PPP network interface, by means of the ``ESP_NETIF_DEFAULT_PPP()`` macro defined in :component_file:`esp_netif/include/esp_netif_defaults.h`. Additional runtime settings are provided via :component_file:`esp_netif/include/esp_netif_ppp.h`. PPPoS interfaces are typically used to interact with NBIoT/GSM/LTE modems. More application-level friendly API is supported by the `esp_modem <https://components.espressif.com/component/espressif/esp_modem>`_ library, which uses this PPP lwIP module behind the scenes.\\n\\nBSD Sockets API\\n---------------\\n\\nThe BSD Sockets API is a common cross-platform TCP/IP sockets API that originated in the Berkeley Standard Distribution of UNIX but is now standardized in a section of the POSIX specification. BSD Sockets are sometimes called POSIX Sockets or Berkeley Sockets.\\n\\nAs implemented in ESP-IDF, lwIP supports all of the common usages of the BSD Sockets API.\\n\\nReferences\\n^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nA wide range of BSD Sockets reference materials are available, including:\\n\\n- `Single UNIX Specification - BSD Sockets page <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xnsix.html>`_\\n- `Berkeley Sockets - Wikipedia page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets>`_\\n\\nExamples\\n^^^^^^^^\\n\\nA number of ESP-IDF examples show how to use the BSD Sockets APIs:\\n\\n- :example:`protocols/sockets/tcp_server`\\n- :example:`protocols/sockets/tcp_client`\\n- :example:`protocols/sockets/udp_server`\\n- :example:`protocols/sockets/udp_client`\\n- :example:`protocols/sockets/udp_multicast`\\n- :example:`protocols/http_request`: this simplified example uses a TCP socket to send an HTTP request, but :doc:`/api-reference/protocols/esp_http_client` is a much better option for sending HTTP requests\\n\\nSupported Functions\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe following BSD socket API functions are supported. For full details, see :component_file:`lwip/lwip/src/include/lwip/sockets.h`.\\n\\n- ``socket()``\\n- ``bind()``\\n- ``accept()``\\n- ``shutdown()``\\n- ``getpeername()``\\n- ``getsockopt()`` & ``setsockopt()``: see `Socket Options`_\\n- ``close()``: via :doc:`/api-reference/storage/vfs`\\n- ``read()``, ``readv()``, ``write()``, ``writev()``: via :doc:`/api-reference/storage/vfs`\\n- ``recv()``, ``recvmsg()``, ``recvfrom()``\\n- ``send()``, ``sendmsg()``, ``sendto()``\\n- ``select()``: via :doc:`/api-reference/storage/vfs`\\n- ``poll()`` : on ESP-IDF, ``poll()`` is implemented by calling ``select()`` internally, so using ``select()`` directly is recommended, if a choice of methods is available\\n- ``fcntl()``: see `fcntl()`_\\n\\nNon-standard functions:\\n\\n- ``ioctl()``: see `ioctl()`_\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  Some lwIP application sample code uses prefixed versions of BSD APIs, e.g., ``lwip_socket()``, instead of the standard ``socket()``. Both forms can be used with ESP-IDF, but using standard names is recommended.\\n\\nSocket Error Handling\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBSD Socket error handling code is very important for robust socket applications. Normally, socket error handling involves the following aspects:\\n\\n- Detecting the error\\n- Getting the error reason code\\n- Handling the error according to the reason code\\n\\nIn lwIP, we have two different scenarios for handling socket errors:\\n\\n- Socket API returns an error. For more information, see `Socket API Errors`_.\\n- ``select(int maxfdp1, fd_set *readset, fd_set *writeset, fd_set *exceptset, struct timeval *timeout)`` has an exception descriptor indicating that the socket has an error. For more information, see `select() Errors`_.\\n\\nSocket API Errors\\n+++++++++++++++++\\n\\n**Error detection**\\n\\n  - We can know that the socket API fails according to its return value.\\n\\n**Get the error reason code**\\n\\n  - When socket API fails, the return value does not contain the failure reason and the application can get the error reason code by accessing ``errno``. Different values indicate different meanings. For more information, see `Socket Error Reason Code`_.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n.. code-block::\\n\\n        int err;\\n        int sockfd;\\n\\n        if (sockfd = socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,0) < 0) {\\n            // the error code is obtained from errno\\n            err = errno;\\n            return err;\\n        }\\n\\n``select()`` Errors\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n**Error detection**\\n\\n  - Socket error when ``select()`` has exception descriptor.\\n\\n**Get the error reason code**\\n\\n  - If the ``select()`` indicates that the socket fails, we can not get the error reason code by accessing ``errno``, instead we should call ``getsockopt()`` to get the failure reason code. Since ``select()`` has exception descriptor, the error code is not given to ``errno``.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The ``getsockopt()`` function has the following prototype: ``int getsockopt(int s, int level, int optname, void *optval, socklen_t *optlen)``. Its purpose is to get the current value of the option of any type, any state socket, and store the result in ``optval``. For example, when you get the error code on a socket, you can get it by ``getsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ERROR, &err, &optlen)``.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n.. code-block::\\n\\n        int err;\\n\\n        if (select(sockfd + 1, NULL, NULL, &exfds, &tval) <= 0) {\\n            err = errno;\\n            return err;\\n        } else {\\n            if (FD_ISSET(sockfd, &exfds)) {\\n                // select() exception set using getsockopt()\\n                int optlen = sizeof(int);\\n                getsockopt(sockfd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_ERROR, &err, &optlen);\\n                return err;\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\nSocket Error Reason Code\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nBelow is a list of common error codes. For a more detailed list of standard POSIX/C error codes, please see `newlib errno.h <https://github.com/espressif/newlib-esp32/blob/master/newlib/libc/include/sys/errno.h>`_ and the platform-specific extensions :component_file:`newlib/platform_include/errno.h`.\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n    :widths: 50 50\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    * - Error code\\n      - Description\\n    * - ECONNREFUSED\\n      - Connection refused\\n    * - EADDRINUSE\\n      - Address already in use\\n    * - ECONNABORTED\\n      - Software caused connection abort\\n    * - ENETUNREACH\\n      - Network is unreachable\\n    * - ENETDOWN\\n      - Network interface is not configured\\n    * - ETIMEDOUT\\n      - Connection timed out\\n    * - EHOSTDOWN\\n      - Host is down\\n    * - EHOSTUNREACH\\n      - Host is unreachable\\n    * - EINPROGRESS\\n      - Connection already in progress\\n    * - EALREADY\\n      - Socket already connected\\n    * - EDESTADDRREQ\\n      - Destination address required\\n    * - EPROTONOSUPPORT\\n      - Unknown protocol\\n\\nSocket Options\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe ``getsockopt()`` and ``setsockopt()`` functions allow getting and setting per-socket options respectively.\\n\\nNot all standard socket options are supported by lwIP in ESP-IDF. The following socket options are supported:\\n\\nCommon Options\\n++++++++++++++\\n\\nUsed with level argument ``SOL_SOCKET``.\\n\\n- ``SO_REUSEADDR``: available if :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_SO_REUSE` is set, whose behavior can be customized by setting :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_SO_REUSE_RXTOALL`\\n- ``SO_KEEPALIVE``\\n- ``SO_BROADCAST``\\n- ``SO_ACCEPTCONN``\\n- ``SO_RCVBUF``: available if :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_SO_RCVBUF` is set\\n- ``SO_SNDTIMEO`` / ``SO_RCVTIMEO``\\n- ``SO_ERROR``: only used with ``select()``, see `Socket Error Handling`_\\n- ``SO_TYPE``\\n- ``SO_NO_CHECK``: for UDP sockets only\\n\\nIP Options\\n++++++++++\\n\\nUsed with level argument ``IPPROTO_IP``.\\n\\n- ``IP_TOS``\\n- ``IP_TTL``\\n- ``IP_PKTINFO``: available if :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_NETBUF_RECVINFO` is set\\n\\nFor multicast UDP sockets:\\n\\n- ``IP_MULTICAST_IF``\\n- ``IP_MULTICAST_LOOP``\\n- ``IP_MULTICAST_TTL``\\n- ``IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP``\\n- ``IP_DROP_MEMBERSHIP``\\n\\nTCP Options\\n+++++++++++\\n\\nTCP sockets only. Used with level argument ``IPPROTO_TCP``.\\n\\n- ``TCP_NODELAY``\\n\\nOptions relating to TCP keepalive probes:\\n\\n- ``TCP_KEEPALIVE``: int value, TCP keepalive period in milliseconds\\n- ``TCP_KEEPIDLE``: same as ``TCP_KEEPALIVE``, but the value is in seconds\\n- ``TCP_KEEPINTVL``: int value, the interval between keepalive probes in seconds\\n- ``TCP_KEEPCNT``: int value, number of keepalive probes before timing out\\n\\nIPv6 Options\\n++++++++++++\\n\\nIPv6 sockets only. Used with level argument ``IPPROTO_IPV6``.\\n\\n- ``IPV6_CHECKSUM``\\n- ``IPV6_V6ONLY``\\n\\nFor multicast IPv6 UDP sockets:\\n\\n- ``IPV6_JOIN_GROUP`` / ``IPV6_ADD_MEMBERSHIP``\\n- ``IPV6_LEAVE_GROUP`` / ``IPV6_DROP_MEMBERSHIP``\\n- ``IPV6_MULTICAST_IF``\\n- ``IPV6_MULTICAST_HOPS``\\n- ``IPV6_MULTICAST_LOOP``\\n\\n``fcntl()``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe ``fcntl()`` function is a standard API for manipulating options related to a file descriptor. In ESP-IDF, the :doc:`/api-reference/storage/vfs` layer is used to implement this function.\\n\\nWhen the file descriptor is a socket, only the following ``fcntl()`` values are supported:\\n\\n- ``O_NONBLOCK`` to set or clear non-blocking I/O mode. Also supports ``O_NDELAY``, which is identical to ``O_NONBLOCK``.\\n- ``O_RDONLY``, ``O_WRONLY``, ``O_RDWR`` flags for different read or write modes. These flags can only be read using ``F_GETFL``, and cannot be set using ``F_SETFL``. A TCP socket returns a different mode depending on whether the connection has been closed at either end or is still open at both ends. UDP sockets always return ``O_RDWR``.\\n\\n``ioctl()``\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe ``ioctl()`` function provides a semi-standard way to access some internal features of the TCP/IP stack. In ESP-IDF, the :doc:`/api-reference/storage/vfs` layer is used to implement this function.\\n\\nWhen the file descriptor is a socket, only the following ``ioctl()`` values are supported:\\n\\n- ``FIONREAD`` returns the number of bytes of the pending data already received in the socket\\'s network buffer.\\n- ``FIONBIO`` is an alternative way to set/clear non-blocking I/O status for a socket, equivalent to ``fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK, ...)``.\\n\\nNetconn API\\n-----------\\n\\nlwIP supports two lower-level APIs as well as the BSD Sockets API: the Netconn API and the Raw API.\\n\\nThe lwIP Raw API is designed for single-threaded devices and is not supported in ESP-IDF.\\n\\nThe Netconn API is used to implement the BSD Sockets API inside lwIP, and it can also be called directly from ESP-IDF apps. This API has lower resource usage than the BSD Sockets API. In particular, it can send and receive data without firstly copying it into internal lwIP buffers.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n  Espressif does not test the Netconn API in ESP-IDF. As such, this functionality is **enabled but not supported**. Some functionality may only work correctly when used from the BSD Sockets API.\\n\\nFor more information about the Netconn API, consult `lwip/lwip/src/include/lwip/api.h <http://www.nongnu.org/lwip/2_0_x/api_8h.html>`_ and `part of the **unofficial** lwIP Application Developers Manual <https://lwip.fandom.com/wiki/Netconn_API>`_.\\n\\nlwIP FreeRTOS Task\\n------------------\\n\\nlwIP creates a dedicated TCP/IP FreeRTOS task to handle socket API requests from other tasks.\\n\\nA number of configuration items are available to modify the task and the queues (mailboxes) used to send data to/from the TCP/IP task:\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_TCPIP_RECVMBOX_SIZE`\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_TCPIP_TASK_STACK_SIZE`\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_TCPIP_TASK_AFFINITY`\\n\\nIPv6 Support\\n------------\\n\\nBoth IPv4 and IPv6 are supported in a dual-stack configuration and are enabled by default. Both IPv6 and IPv4 may be disabled separately if they are not needed, see :ref:`lwip-ram-usage`.\\n\\nIPv6 support is limited to **Stateless Autoconfiguration** only. **Stateful configuration** is not supported in ESP-IDF, nor in upstream lwIP.\\n\\nIPv6 Address configuration is defined by means of these protocols or services:\\n\\n- **SLAAC** IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (RFC-2462)\\n- **DHCPv6** Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (RFC-8415)\\n\\nNone of these two types of address configuration is enabled by default, so the device uses only Link Local addresses or statically-defined addresses.\\n\\n.. _lwip-ivp6-autoconfig:\\n\\nStateless Autoconfiguration Process\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTo enable address autoconfiguration using the Router Advertisement protocol, please enable:\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_IPV6_AUTOCONFIG`\\n\\nThis configuration option enables IPv6 autoconfiguration for all network interfaces, which differs from the upstream lwIP behavior, where the autoconfiguration needs to be explicitly enabled for each ``netif`` with ``netif->ip6_autoconfig_enabled=1``.\\n\\n.. _lwip-ivp6-dhcp6:\\n\\nDHCPv6\\n^^^^^^\\n\\nDHCPv6 in lwIP is very simple and supports only stateless configuration. It could be enabled using:\\n\\n- :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_IPV6_DHCP6`\\n\\nSince the DHCPv6 works only in its stateless configuration, the :ref:`lwip-ivp6-autoconfig` has to be enabled as well via :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_IPV6_AUTOCONFIG`.\\n\\nMoreover, the DHCPv6 needs to be explicitly enabled from the application code using:\\n\\n.. code-block::\\n\\n    dhcp6_enable_stateless(netif);\\n\\nDNS Servers in IPv6 Autoconfiguration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn order to autoconfigure DNS server(s), especially in IPv6-only networks, we have these two options:\\n\\n- Recursive Domain Name System (DNS): this belongs to the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) and uses :ref:`lwip-ivp6-autoconfig`.\\n\\n  The number of servers must be set :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_IPV6_RDNSS_MAX_DNS_SERVERS`, this option is disabled by default, i.e., set to 0.\\n\\n- DHCPv6 stateless configuration, uses :ref:`lwip-ivp6-dhcp6` to configure DNS servers. Note that this configuration assumes IPv6 Router Advertisement Flags (RFC-5175) to be set to\\n\\n    - Managed Address Configuration Flag = 0\\n    - Other Configuration Flag = 1\\n\\nESP-lwIP Custom Modifications\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nAdditions\\n^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe following code is added, which is not present in the upstream lwIP release:\\n\\nThread-Safe Sockets\\n+++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nIt is possible to ``close()`` a socket from a different thread than the one that created it. The ``close()`` call blocks, until any function calls currently using that socket from other tasks have returned.\\n\\nIt is, however, not possible to delete a task while it is actively waiting on ``select()`` or ``poll()`` APIs. It is always necessary that these APIs exit before destroying the task, as this might corrupt internal structures and cause subsequent crashes of the lwIP. These APIs allocate globally referenced callback pointers on the stack so that when the task gets destroyed before unrolling the stack, the lwIP could still hold pointers to the deleted stack.\\n\\nOn-Demand Timers\\n++++++++++++++++\\n\\nlwIP IGMP and MLD6 feature both initialize a timer in order to trigger timeout events at certain times.\\n\\nThe default lwIP implementation is to have these timers enabled all the time, even if no timeout events are active. This increases CPU usage and power consumption when using automatic Light-sleep mode. ``ESP-lwIP`` default behavior is to set each timer ``on demand``, so it is only enabled when an event is pending.\\n\\nTo return to the default lwIP behavior, which is always-on timers, disable :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_TIMERS_ONDEMAND`.\\n\\nlwIP Timers API\\n+++++++++++++++\\n\\nWhen not using Wi-Fi, the lwIP timer can be turned off via the API to reduce power consumption.\\n\\nThe following API functions are supported. For full details, see :component_file:`lwip/lwip/src/include/lwip/timeouts.h`.\\n\\n- ``sys_timeouts_init()``\\n- ``sys_timeouts_deinit()``\\n\\nAdditional Socket Options\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- Some standard IPV4 and IPV6 multicast socket options are implemented, see `Socket Options`_.\\n\\n- Possible to set IPV6-only UDP and TCP sockets with ``IPV6_V6ONLY`` socket option, while normal lwIP is TCP-only.\\n\\nIP Layer Features\\n+++++++++++++++++\\n\\n- IPV4-source-based routing implementation is different\\n\\n- IPV4-mapped IPV6 addresses are supported\\n\\nNAPT and Port Forwarding\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nIPV4 network address port translation (NAPT) and port forwarding are supported. However, the enabling of NAPT is limited to a single interface.\\n\\n- To use NAPT for forwarding packets between two interfaces, it needs to be enabled on the interface connecting to the target network. For example, to enable internet access for Ethernet traffic through the Wi-Fi interface, NAPT must be enabled on the Ethernet interface.\\n- Usage of NAPT is demonstrated in :example:`network/vlan_support`.\\n\\n.. _lwip-custom-hooks:\\n\\nCustomized lwIP Hooks\\n+++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nThe original lwIP supports implementing custom compile-time modifications via ``LWIP_HOOK_FILENAME``. This file is already used by the ESP-IDF port layer, but ESP-IDF users could still include and implement any custom additions via a header file defined by the macro ``ESP_IDF_LWIP_HOOK_FILENAME``. Here is an example of adding a custom hook file to the build process, and the hook is called ``my_hook.h``, located in the project\\'s ``main`` folder:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n   idf_component_get_property(lwip lwip COMPONENT_LIB)\\n   target_compile_options(${lwip} PRIVATE \"-I${PROJECT_DIR}/main\")\\n   target_compile_definitions(${lwip} PRIVATE \"-DESP_IDF_LWIP_HOOK_FILENAME=\\\\\"my_hook.h\\\\\"\")\\n\\nCustomized lwIP Options From ESP-IDF Build System\\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\nThe most common lwIP options are configurable through the component configuration menu. However, certain definitions need to be injected from the command line. The CMake function ``target_compile_definitions()`` can be employed to define macros, as illustrated below:\\n\\n.. code-block:: cmake\\n\\n   idf_component_get_property(lwip lwip COMPONENT_LIB)\\n   target_compile_definitions(${lwip} PRIVATE \"-DETHARP_SUPPORT_VLAN=1\")\\n\\nThis approach may not work for function-like macros, as there is no guarantee that the definition will be accepted by all compilers, although it is supported in GCC. To address this limitation, the ``add_definitions()`` function can be utilized to define the macro for the entire project, for example: ``add_definitions(\"-DFALLBACK_DNS_SERVER_ADDRESS(addr)=\\\\\"IP_ADDR4((addr), 8,8,8,8)\\\\\"\")``.\\n\\nAlternatively, you can define your function-like macro in a header file which will be pre-included as an lwIP hook file, see :ref:`lwip-custom-hooks`.\\n\\nLimitations\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-IDF additions to lwIP still suffer from the global DNS limitation, described in :ref:`lwip-dns-limitation`. To address this limitation from application code, the ``FALLBACK_DNS_SERVER_ADDRESS()`` macro can be utilized to define a global DNS fallback server accessible from all interfaces. Alternatively, you have the option to maintain per-interface DNS servers and reconfigure them whenever the default interface changes.\\n\\nCalling ``send()`` or ``sendto()`` repeatedly on a UDP socket may eventually fail with ``errno`` equal to ``ENOMEM``. This failure occurs due to the limitations of buffer sizes in the lower-layer network interface drivers. If all driver transmit buffers are full, the UDP transmission will fail. For applications that transmit a high volume of UDP datagrams and aim to avoid any dropped datagrams by the sender, it is advisable to implement error code checking and employ a retransmission mechanism with a short delay.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    Increasing the number of TX buffers in the :ref:`Wi-Fi <CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_TX_BUFFER>` or :ref:`Ethernet <CONFIG_ETH_DMA_TX_BUFFER_NUM>` project configuration as applicable may also help.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32 and SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Increasing the number of TX buffers in the :ref:`Wi-Fi <CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_TX_BUFFER>` project configuration may also help.\\n\\n.. _lwip-performance:\\n\\nPerformance Optimization\\n------------------------\\n\\nTCP/IP performance is a complex subject, and performance can be optimized toward multiple goals. The default settings of ESP-IDF are tuned for a compromise between throughput, latency, and moderate memory usage.\\n\\nMaximum Throughput\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nEspressif tests ESP-IDF TCP/IP throughput using the iperf test application: https://iperf.fr/, please refer to :ref:`improve-network-speed` for more details about the actual testing and using the optimized configuration.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n  Suggest applying changes a few at a time and checking the performance each time with a particular application workload.\\n\\n- If a lot of tasks are competing for CPU time on the system, consider that the lwIP task has configurable CPU affinity (:ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_TCPIP_TASK_AFFINITY`) and runs at fixed priority (18, ``ESP_TASK_TCPIP_PRIO``). To optimize CPU utilization, consider assigning competing tasks to different cores or adjusting their priorities to lower values. For additional details on built-in task priorities, please refer to :ref:`built-in-task-priorities`.\\n\\n- If using ``select()`` function with socket arguments only, disabling :ref:`CONFIG_VFS_SUPPORT_SELECT` will make ``select()`` calls faster.\\n\\n- If there is enough free IRAM, select :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_IRAM_OPTIMIZATION` and :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_EXTRA_IRAM_OPTIMIZATION` to improve TX/RX throughput.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    If using a Wi-Fi network interface, please also refer to :ref:`wifi-buffer-usage`.\\n\\nMinimum Latency\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nExcept for increasing buffer sizes, most changes that increase throughput also decrease latency by reducing the amount of CPU time spent in lwIP functions.\\n\\n- For TCP sockets, lwIP supports setting the standard ``TCP_NODELAY`` flag to disable Nagle\\'s algorithm.\\n\\n.. _lwip-ram-usage:\\n\\nMinimum RAM Usage\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nMost lwIP RAM usage is on-demand, as RAM is allocated from the heap as needed. Therefore, changing lwIP settings to reduce RAM usage may not change RAM usage at idle, but can change it at peak.\\n\\n- Reducing :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_MAX_SOCKETS` reduces the maximum number of sockets in the system. This also causes TCP sockets in the ``WAIT_CLOSE`` state to be closed and recycled more rapidly when needed to open a new socket, further reducing peak RAM usage.\\n- Reducing :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_TCPIP_RECVMBOX_SIZE`, :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_TCP_RECVMBOX_SIZE` and :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_UDP_RECVMBOX_SIZE` reduce RAM usage at the expense of throughput, depending on usage.\\n- Reducing :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_TCP_ACCEPTMBOX_SIZE` reduce RAM usage by limiting concurrent accepted connections.\\n- Reducing :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_TCP_MSL` and :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_TCP_FIN_WAIT_TIMEOUT` reduces the maximum segment lifetime in the system. This also causes TCP sockets in the ``TIME_WAIT`` and ``FIN_WAIT_2`` states to be closed and recycled more rapidly.\\n- Disabling :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_IPV6` can save about 39 KB for firmware size and 2 KB RAM when the system is powered up and 7 KB RAM when the TCP/IP stack is running. If there is no requirement for supporting IPV6, it can be disabled to save flash and RAM footprint.\\n- Disabling :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_IPV4` can save about 26 KB of firmware size and 600 B RAM on power up and 6 KB RAM when the TCP/IP stack is running. If the local network supports IPv6-only configuration, IPv4 can be disabled to save flash and RAM footprint.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    If using Wi-Fi, please also refer to :ref:`wifi-buffer-usage`.\\n\\n\\nPeak Buffer Usage\\n+++++++++++++++++\\n\\nThe peak heap memory that lwIP consumes is the **theoretically-maximum memory** that the lwIP driver consumes. Generally, the peak heap memory that lwIP consumes depends on:\\n\\n - the memory required to create a UDP connection: ``lwip_udp_conn``\\n - the memory required to create a TCP connection: ``lwip_tcp_conn``\\n - the number of UDP connections that the application has: ``lwip_udp_con_num``\\n - the number of TCP connections that the application has: ``lwip_tcp_con_num``\\n - the TCP TX window size: ``lwip_tcp_tx_win_size``\\n - the TCP RX window size: ``lwip_tcp_rx_win_size``\\n\\n**So, the peak heap memory that the lwIP consumes can be calculated with the following formula:**\\n  lwip_dynamic_peek_memory =  (lwip_udp_con_num * lwip_udp_conn)  + (lwip_tcp_con_num * (lwip_tcp_tx_win_size + lwip_tcp_rx_win_size + lwip_tcp_conn))\\n\\nSome TCP-based applications need only one TCP connection. However, they may choose to close this TCP connection and create a new one when an error occurs (e.g., a sending failure). This may result in multiple TCP connections existing in the system simultaneously, because it may take a long time for a TCP connection to close, according to the TCP state machine, refer to RFC793.\\n\\n\\n.. _lwIP lightweight TCP/IP stack: https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/\\n.. _esp-lwip: https://github.com/espressif/esp-lwip\\n',\n",

Hence, do not use function pointers to nested functions.\\n\",\n",
       " 'Core Dump\\n=========\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nA core dump is a set of software state information that is automatically saved by the panic handler when a fatal error occurs. Core dumps are useful for conducting post-mortem analysis of the software\\'s state at the moment of failure. ESP-IDF provides support for generating core dumps.\\n\\nA core dump contains snapshots of all tasks in the system at the moment of failure, where each snapshot includes a task\\'s control block (TCB) and stack. By analyzing the task snapshots, it is possible to find out what task, at what instruction (line of code), and what call stack of that task lead to the crash. It is also possible to dump the contents of variables on demand, provided those variables are assigned special core dump attributes.\\n\\nCore dump data is saved to a core dump file according to a particular format, see :doc:`Core dump internals <core_dump_internals>` for more details. However, ESP-IDF\\'s ``idf.py`` command provides special subcommands to decode and analyze the core dump file.\\n\\n\\nConfigurations\\n--------------\\n\\nDestination\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_TO_FLASH_OR_UART` option enables or disables core dump, and selects the core dump destination if enabled. When a crash occurs, the generated core dump file can either be saved to flash, or output to a connected host over UART.\\n\\n\\nFormat & Size\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_DATA_FORMAT` option controls the format of the core dump file, namely ELF format or Binary format.\\n\\nThe ELF format contains extended features and allows more information regarding erroneous tasks and crashed software to be saved. However, using the ELF format causes the core dump file to be larger. This format is recommended for new software designs and is flexible enough to be extended in future revisions to save more information.\\n\\nThe Binary format is kept for compatibility reasons. Binary format core dump files are smaller while provide better performance.\\n\\nThe :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_MAX_TASKS_NUM` option configures the number of task snapshots saved by the core dump.\\n\\nCore dump data integrity checking is supported via the ``Components`` > ``Core dump`` > ``Core dump data integrity check`` option.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    Data Integrity Check\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Core dump files include a checksum, which can be used to verify the integrity of the core dump file, i.e., the file has not been corrupted. The :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_CHECKSUM` option controls the type of checksum, namely CRC32 or SHA256 (only supported in the ELF format).\\n\\n    The CRC32 option provides better calculation performance and consumes less memory for storage.\\n\\n    The SHA256 hash algorithm provides a greater probability of detecting corruption than a CRC32 with multiple-bit errors.\\n\\n\\nReserved Stack Size\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nCore dump routines run from a separate stack due to core dump itself needing to parse and save all other task stacks. The :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_STACK_SIZE` option controls the size of the core dump\\'s stack in number of bytes.\\n\\nSetting this option to 0 bytes will cause the core dump routines to run from the ISR stack, thus saving a bit of memory. Setting the option greater than zero will cause a separate stack to be instantiated.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   If a separate stack is used, the recommended stack size should be larger than 800 bytes to ensure that the core dump routines themselves do not cause a stack overflow.\\n\\n\\nCore Dump to Flash\\n------------------\\n\\nWhen the core dump file is saved to flash, the file is saved to a special core dump partition in flash. Specifying the core dump partition will reserve space on the flash chip to store the core dump file.\\n\\nThe core dump partition is automatically declared when using the default partition table provided by ESP-IDF. However, when using a custom partition table, you need to declare the core dump partition, as illustrated below:\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    # Name,   Type, SubType, Offset,  Size\\n    # Note: if you have increased the bootloader size, make sure to update the offsets to avoid overlap\\n    nvs,      data, nvs,     0x9000,  0x6000\\n    phy_init, data, phy,     0xf000,  0x1000\\n    factory,  app,  factory, 0x10000, 1M\\n    coredump, data, coredump,,        64K\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n    If :doc:`../security/flash-encryption` is enabled on the device, please add an ``encrypted`` flag to the core dump partition declaration.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: none\\n\\n        coredump, data, coredump,,       64K, encrypted\\n\\nThere are no special requirements for the partition name. It can be chosen according to the application\\'s needs, but the partition type should be ``data`` and the sub-type should be ``coredump``. Also, when choosing partition size, note that the core dump file introduces a constant overhead of 20 bytes and a per-task overhead of 12 bytes. This overhead does not include the size of TCB and stack for every task. So the partition size should be at least ``20 + max tasks number x (12 + TCB size + max task stack size)`` bytes.\\n\\nAn example of the generic command to analyze core dump from flash is:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    idf.py coredump-info\\n\\nor\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    idf.py coredump-debug\\n\\n\\nCore Dump to UART\\n-----------------\\n\\nWhen the core dump file is output to UART, the output file is Base64-encoded. The :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_DECODE` option allows for selecting whether the output file is automatically decoded by the ESP-IDF monitor or kept encoded for manual decoding.\\n\\n\\nAutomatic Decoding\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_DECODE` is set to automatically decode the UART core dump, ESP-IDF monitor will automatically decode the data, translate any function addresses to source code lines, and display it in the monitor. The output to ESP-IDF monitor would resemble the following output:\\n\\nThe :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_UART_DELAY` allows for an optional delay to be added before the core dump file is output to UART.\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n    ===============================================================\\n    ==================== ESP32 CORE DUMP START ====================\\n\\n    Crashed task handle: 0x3ffafba0, name: \\'main\\', GDB name: \\'process 1073413024\\'\\n    Crashed task is not in the interrupt context\\n    Panic reason: abort() was called at PC 0x400d66b9 on core 0\\n\\n    ================== CURRENT THREAD REGISTERS ===================\\n    exccause       0x1d (StoreProhibitedCause)\\n    excvaddr       0x0\\n    epc1           0x40084013\\n    epc2           0x0\\n    ...\\n    ==================== CURRENT THREAD STACK =====================\\n    #0  0x4008110d in panic_abort (details=0x3ffb4f0b \"abort() was called at PC 0x400d66b9 on core 0\") at /builds/espressif/esp-idf/components/esp_system/panic.c:472\\n    #1  0x4008510c in esp_system_abort (details=0x3ffb4f0b \"abort() was called at PC 0x400d66b9 on core 0\") at /builds/espressif/esp-idf/components/esp_system/port/esp_system_chip.c:93\\n    ...\\n    ======================== THREADS INFO =========================\\n      Id   Target Id          Frame\\n    * 1    process 1073413024 0x4008110d in panic_abort (details=0x3ffb4f0b \"abort() was called at PC 0x400d66b9 on core 0\") at /builds/espressif/esp-idf/components/esp_system/panic.c:472\\n      2    process 1073413368 vPortTaskWrapper (pxCode=0x0, pvParameters=0x0) at /builds/espressif/esp-idf/components/freertos/FreeRTOS-Kernel/portable/xtensa/port.c:133\\n    ...\\n           TCB             NAME PRIO C/B  STACK USED/FREE\\n    ---------- ---------------- -------- ----------------\\n    0x3ffafba0             main      1/1         368/3724\\n    0x3ffafcf8            IDLE0      0/0         288/1240\\n    0x3ffafe50            IDLE1      0/0         416/1108\\n    ...\\n    ==================== THREAD 1 (TCB: 0x3ffafba0, name: \\'main\\') =====================\\n    #0  0x4008110d in panic_abort (details=0x3ffb4f0b \"abort() was called at PC 0x400d66b9 on core 0\") at /builds/espressif/esp-idf/components/esp_system/panic.c:472\\n    #1  0x4008510c in esp_system_abort (details=0x3ffb4f0b \"abort() was called at PC 0x400d66b9 on core 0\") at /builds/espressif/esp-idf/components/esp_system/port/esp_system_chip.c:93\\n    ...\\n    ==================== THREAD 2 (TCB: 0x3ffafcf8, name: \\'IDLE0\\') =====================\\n    #0  vPortTaskWrapper (pxCode=0x0, pvParameters=0x0) at /builds/espressif/esp-idf/components/freertos/FreeRTOS-Kernel/portable/xtensa/port.c:133\\n    #1  0x40000000 in ??

The ``CORE DUMP START`` and ``CORE DUMP END`` lines must not be included in a core dump text file. The saved text can the be decoded using the following command:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    idf.py coredump-info -c </path/to/saved/base64/text>\\n\\nor\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    idf.py coredump-debug -c </path/to/saved/base64/text>\\n\\n\\nCore Dump Commands\\n------------------\\n\\nESP-IDF provides special commands to help to retrieve and analyze core dumps:\\n\\n* ``idf.py coredump-info`` - prints crashed task\\'s registers, call stack, list of available tasks in the system, memory regions, and contents of memory stored in core dump (TCBs and stacks).\\n* ``idf.py coredump-debug`` - creates core dump ELF file and runs GDB debug session with this file. You can examine memory, variables, and task states manually. Note that since not all memory is saved in the core dump, only the values of variables allocated on the stack are meaningful.\\n\\n\\nROM Functions in Backtraces\\n---------------------------\\n\\nIt is a possible that at the moment of a crash, some tasks and/or the crashed task itself have one or more ROM functions in their call stacks. Since ROM is not part of the program ELF, it is impossible for GDB to parse such call stacks due to GDB analyzing functions\\' prologues to decode backtraces. Thus, call stack parsing will break with an error message upon the first ROM function that is encountered.\\n\\nTo overcome this issue, the `ROM ELF <https://github.com/espressif/esp-rom-elfs/releases>`_ provided by Espressif is loaded automatically by ESP-IDF monitor based on the target and its revision. More details about ROM ELFs can be found in `esp-rom-elfs <https://github.com/espressif/esp-rom-elfs/blob/master/README.md>`_.\\n\\n\\nDumping Variables on Demand\\n---------------------------\\n\\nSometimes you want to read the last value of a variable to understand the root cause of a crash. Core dump supports retrieving variable data over GDB by applying special attributes to declared variables.\\n\\n\\nSupported Notations and RAM Regions\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n   * ``COREDUMP_DRAM_ATTR`` places the variable into the DRAM area, which is included in the dump.\\n   :SOC_RTC_FAST_MEM_SUPPORTED or SOC_RTC_SLOW_MEM_SUPPORTED: * ``COREDUMP_RTC_ATTR`` places the variable into the RTC area, which is included in the dump.\\n   :SOC_RTC_FAST_MEM_SUPPORTED: * ``COREDUMP_RTC_FAST_ATTR`` places the variable into the RTC_FAST area, which is included in the dump.\\n\\n\\nExample\\n^^^^^^^\\n\\n1. In :ref:`project-configuration-menu`, enable :ref:`COREDUMP TO FLASH <CONFIG_ESP_COREDUMP_TO_FLASH_OR_UART>`, then save and exit.\\n\\n2. In your project, create a global variable in the DRAM area, such as:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n   // uint8_t global_var;\\n   COREDUMP_DRAM_ATTR uint8_t global_var;\\n\\n3. In the main application, set the variable to any value and ``assert(0)`` to cause a crash.\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n   global_var = 25;\\n   assert(0);\\n\\n4. Build, flash, and run the application on a target device and wait for the dumping information.\\n\\n5. Run the command below to start core dumping in GDB, where ``PORT`` is the device USB port:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n   idf.py coredump-debug\\n\\n6.

This section describes how ESP-IDF uses these features by default.\\n\\nESP-IDF distinguishes between instruction memory bus (IRAM, IROM, RTC FAST memory) and data memory bus (DRAM, DROM). Instruction memory is executable, and can only be read or written via 4-byte aligned words. Data memory is not executable and can be accessed via individual byte operations. For more information about the different memory buses consult the *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* > *System and Memory*  [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#sysmem>`__].\\n\\n.. _dram:\\n\\nDRAM (Data RAM)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nNon-constant static data (.data) and zero-initialized data (.bss) is placed by the linker into Internal SRAM as data memory. The remaining space in this region is used for the runtime heap.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_SPIRAM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n   By applying the ``EXT_RAM_BSS_ATTR`` macro, zero-initialized data can also be placed into external RAM. To use this macro, the :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_ALLOW_BSS_SEG_EXTERNAL_MEMORY` needs to be enabled. See :ref:`external_ram_config_bss`.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n   The available size of the internal DRAM region is reduced by 64 KB (by shifting start address to ``0x3FFC0000``) if Bluetooth stack is used. Length of this region is also reduced by 16 KB or 32 KB if trace memory is used. Due to some memory fragmentation issues caused by ROM, it is also not possible to use all available DRAM for static allocations - however the remaining DRAM is still available as heap at runtime.\\n\\n   .. note::\\n\\n    There is 520 KB of available SRAM (320 KB of DRAM and 200 KB of IRAM) on the ESP32. However, due to a technical limitation, the maximum statically allocated DRAM usage is 160 KB. The remaining 160 KB (for a total of 320 KB of DRAM) can only be allocated at runtime as heap.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n   .. note::\\n\\n    The maximum statically allocated DRAM size is reduced by the :ref:`iram` size of the compiled application. The available heap memory at runtime is reduced by the total static IRAM and DRAM usage of the application.\\n\\nConstant data may also be placed into DRAM, for example if it is used in an non-flash-safe ISR (see explanation under :ref:`how-to-place-code-in-iram`).\\n\\n\\n\"noinit\" DRAM\\n=============\\n\\nThe macro ``__NOINIT_ATTR`` can be used as attribute to place data into ``.noinit`` section. The values placed into this section will not be initialized at startup and should keep its value after software restart.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    By applying the ``EXT_RAM_NOINIT_ATTR`` macro, non-initialized value could also be placed in external RAM. To do this, the :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_ALLOW_NOINIT_SEG_EXTERNAL_MEMORY` needs to be enabled. See :ref:`external_ram_config_noinit`. If the :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_ALLOW_NOINIT_SEG_EXTERNAL_MEMORY` is not enabled, ``EXT_RAM_NOINIT_ATTR`` will behave just as ``__NOINIT_ATTR``, it will make data to be placed into ``.noinit`` segment in internal RAM.\\n\\nExample::\\n\\n    __NOINIT_ATTR uint32_t noinit_data;\\n\\n\\n.. _iram:\\n\\nIRAM (Instruction RAM)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    ESP-IDF allocates part of the Internal SRAM0 region for instruction RAM. The region is defined in *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* > *System and Memory* > *Embedded Memory* [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#sysmem>`__]. Except for the first 64 KB block which is used for PRO and APP MMU caches, the rest of this memory range (i.e., from ``0x40080000`` to ``0x400A0000``) is used to store parts of the application which need to run from RAM.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32s2\\n\\n    ESP-IDF allocates part of the Internal SRAM region for instruction RAM. The region is defined in *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* > *System and Memory* > *Internal Memory* [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#sysmem>`__]. Except for the first block (up to 32 KB) which is used for MMU cache, the rest of this memory range is used to store parts of application which need to run from RAM.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Any internal SRAM which is not used for Instruction RAM will be made available as :ref:`dram` for static data and dynamic allocation (heap).\\n\\n\\nWhen to Place Code in IRAM\\n================================\\n\\nCases when parts of the application should be placed into IRAM:\\n\\n- Interrupt handlers must be placed into IRAM if ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_IRAM`` is used when registering the interrupt handler. For more information, see :ref:`iram-safe-interrupt-handlers`.\\n\\n- Some timing critical code may be placed into IRAM to reduce the penalty associated with loading the code from flash. {IDF_TARGET_NAME} reads code and data from flash via the MMU cache. In some cases, placing a function into IRAM may reduce delays caused by a cache miss and significantly improve that function\\'s performance.\\n\\n\\n.. _how-to-place-code-in-iram:\\n\\nHow to Place Code in IRAM\\n=========================\\n\\nSome code is automatically placed into the IRAM region using the linker script.\\n\\nIf some specific application code needs to be placed into IRAM, it can be done by using the :doc:`linker-script-generation` feature and adding a linker script fragment file to your component that targets at the entire source files or functions with the ``noflash`` placement. See the :doc:`linker-script-generation` docs for more information.\\n\\nAlternatively, it is possible to specify IRAM placement in the source code using the ``IRAM_ATTR`` macro::\\n\\n    #include \"esp_attr.h\"\\n\\n    void IRAM_ATTR gpio_isr_handler(void* arg)\\n    {\\n        // ...\\n    }\\n\\nThere are some possible issues with placement in IRAM, that may cause problems with IRAM-safe interrupt handlers:\\n\\n* Strings or constants inside an ``IRAM_ATTR`` function may not be placed in RAM automatically. It is possible to use ``DRAM_ATTR`` attributes to mark these, or using the linker script method will cause these to be automatically placed correctly.\\n\\n  .. code-block:: c\\n\\n    void IRAM_ATTR gpio_isr_handler(void* arg)\\n    {\\n       const static DRAM_ATTR uint8_t INDEX_DATA[] = { 45, 33, 12, 0 };\\n       const static char *MSG = DRAM_STR(\"I am a string stored in RAM\");\\n    }\\n\\nNote that knowing which data should be marked with ``DRAM_ATTR`` can be hard, the compiler will sometimes recognize that a variable or expression is constant (even if it is not marked ``const``) and optimize it into flash, unless it is marked with ``DRAM_ATTR``.\\n\\n* GCC optimizations that automatically generate jump tables or switch/case lookup tables place these tables in flash. IDF by default builds all files with ``-fno-jump-tables -fno-tree-switch-conversion`` flags to avoid this.\\n\\nJump table optimizations can be re-enabled for individual source files that do not need to be placed in IRAM. For instructions on how to add the ``-fno-jump-tables -fno-tree-switch-conversion`` options when compiling individual source files, see :ref:`component_build_control`.\\n\\n\\n.. _irom:\\n\\nIROM (Code Executed from flash)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf a function is not explicitly placed into :ref:`iram` or RTC memory, it is placed into flash. As IRAM is limited, most of an application\\'s binary code must be placed into IROM instead.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    The mechanism by which Flash MMU is used to allow code execution from flash is described in *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* > *Memory Management and Protection Units (MMU, MPU)* [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#mpummu>`__].\\n\\nDuring :doc:`startup`, the bootloader (which runs from IRAM) configures the MMU flash cache to map the app\\'s instruction code region to the instruction space. Flash accessed via the MMU is cached using some internal SRAM and accessing cached flash data is as fast as accessing other types of internal memory.\\n\\n\\n.. _drom:\\n\\nDROM (Data Stored in flash)\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. highlight:: c\\n\\nBy default, constant data is placed by the linker into a region mapped to the MMU flash cache. This is the same as the :ref:`irom` section, but is for read-only data not executable code.\\n\\nThe only constant data not placed into this memory type by default are literal constants which are embedded by the compiler into application code. These are placed as the surrounding function\\'s executable instructions.\\n\\nThe ``DRAM_ATTR`` attribute can be used to force constants from DROM into the :ref:`dram` section (see above).\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_RTC_SLOW_MEM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    RTC Slow Memory\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Global and static variables used by code which runs from RTC memory must be placed into RTC Slow memory. For example :doc:`deep sleep <deep-sleep-stub>` variables can be placed here instead of RTC FAST memory, or code and variables accessed by the :doc:`/api-reference/system/ulp`.\\n\\n    The attribute macro named ``RTC_NOINIT_ATTR`` can be used to place data into this type of memory. The values placed into this section keep their value after waking from deep sleep.\\n\\n    Example::\\n\\n        RTC_NOINIT_ATTR uint32_t rtc_noinit_data;\\n\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_RTC_FAST_MEM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    RTC FAST Memory\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32c6 or esp32h2\\n\\n        .. note::\\n\\n            On {IDF_TARGET_NAME} what was previously referred to as RTC memory has been renamed LP (low power) memory. You might see both terms being used interchangeably in IDF code, docs and the technical reference manual.\\n\\n\\n    The same region of RTC FAST memory can be accessed as both instruction and data memory. Code which has to run after wake-up from deep sleep mode has to be placed into RTC memory. Please check detailed description in :doc:`deep sleep <deep-sleep-stub>` documentation.\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32\\n\\n        In single core mode (:ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE`), remaining RTC FAST memory is added to the heap, unless the option :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_ALLOW_RTC_FAST_MEM_AS_HEAP` is disabled. This memory can be used interchangeably with :ref:`DRAM`, but is slightly slower to access and not DMA-capable.\\n\\n        This option is not available in dual core mode, because on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, RTC FAST memory can only be accessed by the PRO CPU.\\n\\n    .. only:: not esp32\\n\\n        Remaining RTC FAST memory is added to the heap unless the option :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_ALLOW_RTC_FAST_MEM_AS_HEAP` is disabled. This memory can be used interchangeably with :ref:`DRAM`, but is slightly slower to access.\\n\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_MEM_TCM_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    TCM (Tightly-Coupled Memory)\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    TCM is memory placed near the CPU, accessible at CPU frequency without passing through a cache. Even though on average, it may not surpass the efficiency or speed of cached memory, it does provide predictable and consistent access times. TCM can be useful for time-critical routines where having a deterministic access speed is important.\\n\\n\\nDMA-Capable Requirement\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. highlight:: c\\n\\nMost peripheral DMA controllers (e.g., SPI, sdmmc, etc.) have requirements that sending/receiving buffers should be placed in DRAM and word-aligned. We suggest to place DMA buffers in static variables rather than in the stack. Use macro ``DMA_ATTR`` to declare global/local static variables like::\\n\\n    DMA_ATTR uint8_t buffer[]=\"I want to send something\";\\n\\n    void app_main()\\n    {\\n        // initialization code...\\n        spi_transaction_t temp = {\\n            .tx_buffer = buffer,\\n            .length = 8 * sizeof(buffer),\\n        };\\n        spi_device_transmit(spi, &temp);\\n        // other stuff\\n    }\\n\\nOr::\\n\\n    void app_main()\\n    {\\n        DMA_ATTR static uint8_t buffer[] = \"I want to send something\";\\n        // initialization code...\\n        spi_transaction_t temp = {\\n            .tx_buffer = buffer,\\n            .length = 8 * sizeof(buffer),\\n        };\\n        spi_device_transmit(spi, &temp);\\n        // other stuff\\n    }\\n\\nIt is also possible to allocate DMA-capable memory buffers dynamically by using the :ref:`MALLOC_CAP_DMA <dma-capable-memory>` capabilities flag.\\n\\nDMA Buffer in the Stack\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nPlacing DMA buffers in the stack is possible but discouraged. If doing so, pay attention to the following:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    :SOC_SPIRAM_SUPPORTED: - Placing DRAM buffers on the stack is not recommended if the stack may be in PSRAM. If the stack of a task is placed in the PSRAM, several steps have to be taken as described in :doc:`external-ram`.\\n    - Use macro ``WORD_ALIGNED_ATTR`` in functions before variables to place them in proper positions like::\\n\\n        void app_main()\\n        {\\n            uint8_t stuff;\\n            WORD_ALIGNED_ATTR uint8_t buffer[] = \"I want to send something\";   //or the buffer will be placed right after stuff.\\n            // initialization code...\\n            spi_transaction_t temp = {\\n                .tx_buffer = buffer,\\n                .length = 8 * sizeof(buffer),\\n            };\\n            spi_device_transmit(spi, &temp);\\n            // other stuff\\n        }\\n',\n",

       " \"* Regarding stacks in PSRAM: For tasks that do not call ROM code in any way (directly or indirectly), the :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_ALLOW_STACK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY` option will eliminate the check in :cpp:func:`xTaskCreateStatic`, allowing a task's stack to be in external RAM. However, using this is **not advised**.\\n* When used at 80 MHz clock speed, external RAM must also occupy either the HSPI or VSPI bus. Select which SPI host will be used by :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_OCCUPY_SPI_HOST`.\\n\\n\\nChip Revisions\\n==============\\n\\nThere are some issues with certain revisions of ESP32 that have repercussions for use with external RAM. The issues are documented in the `ESP32 Series SoC Errata`_ document. In particular, ESP-IDF handles the bugs mentioned in the following ways:\\n\\n\\nESP32 Rev v0.0\\n--------------\\nESP-IDF has no workaround for the bugs in this revision of silicon, and it cannot be used to map external PSRAM into ESP32's main memory map.\\n\\n\\nESP32 Rev v1.0\\n--------------\\nThe bugs in this revision of silicon cause issues if certain sequences of machine instructions operate on external memory. (`ESP32 Series SoC Errata`_ 3.2). As a workaround, the ``-mfix-esp32-psram-cache-issue`` flag has been added to the ESP32 GCC compiler such that these sequences are filtered out. As a result, the compiler only outputs code that can safely be executed. The :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_WORKAROUND` option can be used to enable this workaround.\\n\\nAside from linking to a recompiled version of Newlib with the additional flag, ESP-IDF also does the following:\\n\\n- Avoids using some ROM functions\\n- Allocates static memory for the Wi-Fi stack\\n\\nESP32 Rev v3.0\\n--------------\\n\\nESP32 rev v3.0 fixes the PSRAM cache issue found in rev v1.0. When :ref:`CONFIG_ESP32_REV_MIN` option is set to ``rev v3.0``, compiler workarounds related to PSRAM will be disabled.

The reset of the target chip is performed using the DTR and RTS serial lines. To prevent IDF Monitor from automatically resetting the target on connection, call IDF Monitor with the ``--no-reset`` option (e.g., ``idf.py monitor --no-reset``). You can also set the environment variable ``ESP_IDF_MONITOR_NO_RESET`` to ``1`` to achieve the same behavior.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The ``--no-reset`` option applies the same behavior even when connecting IDF Monitor to a particular port (e.g., ``idf.py monitor --no-reset -p [PORT]``).\\n\\n\\n.. _target-reset-into-bootloader:\\n\\nTarget Reset into Bootloader\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIDF Monitor provides the capability to reset a chip into the bootloader using a pre-defined reset sequence that has been tuned to work in most environments. Additionally, users have the flexibility to set a custom reset sequence, allowing for fine-tuning and adaptability to diverse scenarios.\\n\\nUsing Pre-defined Reset Sequence\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nIDF Monitor\\'s default reset sequence is designed to work seamlessly across a wide range of environments. To trigger a reset into the bootloader using the default sequence, no additional configuration is required.\\n\\nCustom Reset Sequence\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more advanced users or specific use cases, IDF Monitor supports the configuration of a custom reset sequence using :ref:`configuration-file`. This is particularly useful in extreme edge cases where the default sequence may not suffice.\\n\\nThe sequence is defined with a string in the following format:\\n\\n- Consists of individual commands divided by ``|`` (e.g. ``R0|D1|W0.5``).\\n- Commands (e.g. ``R0``) are defined by a code (``R``) and an argument (``0``).\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n    :widths: 15 50 35\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    * - Code\\n      - Action\\n      - Argument\\n    * - D\\n      - Set DTR control line\\n      - ``1``/``0``\\n    * - R\\n      - Set RTS control line\\n      - ``1``/``0``\\n    * - U\\n      - Set DTR and RTS control lines at the same time (Unix-like systems only)\\n      - ``0,0``/``0,1``/``1,0``/``1,1``\\n    * - W\\n      - Wait for ``N`` seconds (where ``N`` is a float)\\n      - N\\n\\nExample:\\n\\n.. code-block:: ini\\n\\n    [esp-idf-monitor]\\n    custom_reset_sequence = U0,1|W0.1|D1|R0|W0.5|D0\\n\\nRefer to `custom reset sequence`_ from Esptool documentation for further details. Please note that ``custom_reset_sequence`` is the only used value from the Esptool configuration, and others will be ignored in IDF Monitor.\\n\\nShare Configuration Across Tools\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nThe configuration for the custom reset sequence can be specified in a shared configuration file between IDF Monitor and Esptool. In this case, your configuration file name should be either ``setup.cfg`` or ``tox.ini`` so it would be recognized by both tools.\\n\\nExample of a shared configuration file:\\n\\n.. code-block:: ini\\n\\n    [esp-idf-monitor]\\n    menu_key = T\\n    skip_menu_key = True\\n\\n    [esptool]\\n    custom_reset_sequence = U0,1|W0.1|D1|R0|W0.5|D0\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    When using the ``custom_reset_sequence`` parameter in both the ``[esp-idf-monitor]`` section and the ``[esptool]`` section, the configuration from the ``[esp-idf-monitor]`` section will take precedence in IDF Monitor. Any conflicting configuration in the ``[esptool]`` section will be ignored.\\n\\n    This precedence rule also applies when the configuration is spread across multiple files. The global esp-idf-monitor configuration will take precedence over the local esptool configuration.\\n\\n\\nLaunching GDB with GDBStub\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nGDBStub is a useful runtime debugging feature that runs on the target and connects to the host over the serial port to receive debugging commands. GDBStub supports commands such as reading memory and variables, examining call stack frames etc. Although GDBStub is less versatile than JTAG debugging, it does not require any special hardware (such as a JTAG to USB bridge) as communication is done entirely over the serial port.\\n\\nA target can be configured to run GDBStub in the background by setting the :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_GDBSTUB_RUNTIME`. GDBStub will run in the background until a ``Ctrl+C`` message is sent over the serial port and causes the GDBStub to break (i.e., stop the execution of) the program, thus allowing GDBStub to handle debugging commands.\\n\\nFurthermore, the panic handler can be configured to run GDBStub on a crash by setting the :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_PANIC` to ``GDBStub on panic``. When a crash occurs, GDBStub will output a special string pattern over the serial port to indicate that it is running.\\n\\nIn both cases (i.e., sending the ``Ctrl+C`` message, or receiving the special string pattern), IDF Monitor will automatically launch GDB in order to allow the user to send debugging commands. After GDB exits, the target is reset via the RTS serial line. If this line is not connected, users can reset their target (by pressing the board\\'s Reset button).\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    In the background, IDF Monitor runs the following command to launch GDB::\\n\\n        {IDF_TARGET_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX}-gdb -ex \"set serial baud BAUD\" -ex \"target remote PORT\" -ex interrupt build/PROJECT.elf :idf_target:`Hello NAME chip`\\n\\n\\nOutput Filtering\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIDF monitor can be invoked as ``idf.py monitor --print-filter=\"xyz\"``, where ``--print-filter`` is the parameter for output filtering. The default value is an empty string, which means that everything is printed. Filtering can also be configured using the ``ESP_IDF_MONITOR_PRINT_FILTER`` environment variable.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   When using both the environment variable ``ESP_IDF_MONITOR_PRINT_FILTER`` and the argument ``--print-filter``, the setting from the CLI argument will take precedence.\\n\\nRestrictions on what to print can be specified as a series of ``<tag>:<log_level>`` items where ``<tag>`` is the tag string and ``<log_level>`` is a character from the set ``{N, E, W, I, D, V, *}`` referring to a level for :doc:`logging <../../api-reference/system/log>`.\\n\\nFor example, ``--print_filter=\"tag1:W\"`` matches and prints only the outputs written with ``ESP_LOGW(\"tag1\", ...)`` or at lower verbosity level, i.e., ``ESP_LOGE(\"tag1\", ...)``. Not specifying a ``<log_level>`` or using ``*`` defaults to a Verbose level.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   Use primary logging to disable at compilation the outputs you do not need through the :doc:`logging library <../../api-reference/system/log>`. Output filtering with the IDF monitor is a secondary solution that can be useful for adjusting the filtering options without recompiling the application.\\n\\nYour app tags must not contain spaces, asterisks ``*``, or colons ``:`` to be compatible with the output filtering feature.\\n\\nIf the last line of the output in your app is not followed by a carriage return, the output filtering might get confused, i.e., the monitor starts to print the line and later finds out that the line should not have been written. This is a known issue and can be avoided by always adding a carriage return (especially when no output follows immediately afterwards).\\n\\nExamples of Filtering Rules:\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n- ``*`` can be used to match any tags. However, the string ``--print_filter=\"*:I tag1:E\"`` with regards to ``tag1`` prints errors only, because the rule for ``tag1`` has a higher priority over the rule for ``*``.\\n- The default (empty) rule is equivalent to ``*:V`` because matching every tag at the Verbose level or lower means matching everything.\\n- ``\"*:N\"`` suppresses not only the outputs from logging functions, but also the prints made by ``printf``, etc. To avoid this, use ``*:E`` or a higher verbosity level.\\n- Rules ``\"tag1:V\"``, ``\"tag1:v\"``, ``\"tag1:\"``, ``\"tag1:*\"``, and ``\"tag1\"`` are equivalent.\\n- Rule ``\"tag1:W tag1:E\"`` is equivalent to ``\"tag1:E\"`` because any consequent occurrence of the same tag name overwrites the previous one.\\n- Rule ``\"tag1:I tag2:W\"`` only prints ``tag1`` at the Info verbosity level or lower and ``tag2`` at the Warning verbosity level or lower.\\n- Rule ``\"tag1:I tag2:W tag3:N\"`` is essentially equivalent to the previous one because ``tag3:N`` specifies that ``tag3`` should not be printed.\\n- ``tag3:N`` in the rule ``\"tag1:I tag2:W tag3:N *:V\"`` is more meaningful because without ``tag3:N`` the ``tag3`` messages could have been printed; the errors for ``tag1`` and ``tag2`` will be printed at the specified (or lower) verbosity level and everything else will be printed by default.\\n\\n\\nA More Complex Filtering Example\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe following log snippet was acquired without any filtering options::\\n\\n    load:0x40078000,len:13564\\n    entry 0x40078d4c\\n    E (31) esp_image: image at 0x30000 has invalid magic byte\\n    W (31) esp_image: image at 0x30000 has invalid SPI mode 255\\n    E (39) boot: Factory app partition is not bootable\\n    I (568) cpu_start: Pro cpu up.\\n    I (569) heap_init: Initializing.

Characters from the config file are converted to their C0 control codes. Available characters include the English alphabet (A-Z) and special symbols: ``[``, ``]``, ``\\\\``, ``^``, ``_``.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    Please note that some characters may not work on all platforms or can be already reserved as a shortcut for something else. Use this feature with caution!\\n\\n\\nFile Location\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe default name for a configuration file is ``esp-idf-monitor.cfg``. First, the same directory ``esp-idf-monitor`` is being run if is inspected.\\n\\nIf a configuration file is not found here, the current user\\'s OS configuration directory is inspected next:\\n\\n - Linux: ``/home/<user>/.config/esp-idf-monitor/``\\n - MacOS ``/Users/<user>/.config/esp-idf-monitor/``\\n - Windows: ``c:\\\\Users\\\\<user>\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\esp-idf-monitor\\\\``\\n\\nIf a configuration file is still not found, the last inspected location is the home directory:\\n\\n - Linux: ``/home/<user>/``\\n - MacOS ``/Users/<user>/``\\n - Windows: ``c:\\\\Users\\\\<user>\\\\``\\n\\nOn Windows, the home directory can be set with the ``HOME`` or ``USERPROFILE`` environment variables. Therefore, the Windows configuration directory location also depends on these.\\n\\nA different location for the configuration file can be specified with the ``ESP_IDF_MONITOR_CFGFILE`` environment variable, e.g., ``ESP_IDF_MONITOR_CFGFILE = ~/custom_config.cfg``. This overrides the search priorities described above.\\n\\n``esp-idf-monitor`` will read settings from other usual configuration files if no other configuration file is used.

       " '****************\\nIDF Docker Image\\n****************\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\n..\\n    When changing this page, please keep tools/docker/README.md in sync.\\n\\n.. highlight:: bash\\n\\nIDF Docker image (``espressif/idf``) is intended for building applications and libraries with specific versions of ESP-IDF when doing automated builds.\\n\\nThe image contains:\\n\\n- Common utilities such as ``git``, ``wget``, ``curl``, and ``zip``.\\n- Python 3.8 or newer.\\n- A copy of a specific version of ESP-IDF. See below for information about versions. ``IDF_PATH`` environment variable is set and points to the ESP-IDF location in the container.\\n- All the build tools required for the specific version of ESP-IDF: CMake, Ninja, cross-compiler toolchains, etc.\\n- All Python packages required by ESP-IDF are installed in a virtual environment.\\n\\nThe image ``ENTRYPOINT`` sets up the ``PATH`` environment variable to point to the correct version of tools, and activates the Python virtual environment. As a result, the environment is ready to use the ESP-IDF build system.\\n\\nThe image can also be used as a base for custom images, if additional utilities are required.\\n\\nTags\\n====\\n\\nMultiple tags of this image are maintained:\\n\\n- ``latest``: tracks ``master`` branch of ESP-IDF\\n- ``vX.Y``: corresponds to ESP-IDF release ``vX.Y``\\n- ``release-vX.Y``: tracks ``release/vX.Y`` branch of ESP-IDF\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Versions of ESP-IDF released before this feature was introduced do not have corresponding Docker image versions. You can check the up-to-date list of available tags at https://hub.docker.com/r/espressif/idf/tags.\\n\\nUsage\\n=====\\n\\nSetting up Docker\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nBefore using the ``espressif/idf`` Docker image locally, make sure you have Docker installed. Follow the instructions at https://docs.docker.com/install/, if it is not installed yet.\\n\\nIf using the image in a CI environment, consult the documentation of your CI service on how to specify the image used for the build process.\\n\\nBuilding a Project with CMake\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn the project directory, run:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    docker run --rm -v $PWD:/project -w /project -u $UID -e HOME=/tmp espressif/idf idf.py build\\n\\nThe above command explained:\\n\\n- ``docker run``: runs a Docker image. It is a shorter form of the command ``docker container run``.\\n- ``--rm``: removes the container when the build is finished.\\n- ``-v $PWD:/project``: mounts the current directory on the host (``$PWD``) as ``/project`` directory in the container.\\n- ``-w /project``: makes ``/project`` the working directory for the command.\\n- ``-u $UID``: makes the command run with your user ID so that files are created as you (instead of root).\\n- ``-e HOME=/tmp``: gives the user a home directory for storing temporary files created by ``idf.py`` in ``~/.cache``.\\n- ``espressif/idf``: uses Docker image ``espressif/idf`` with tag ``latest``. The ``latest`` tag is implicitly added by Docker when no tag is specified.\\n- ``idf.py build``: runs this command inside the container.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   When the mounted directory, ``/project``, contains a git repository owned by a different user (``UID``) than the one running the Docker container, git commands executed within ``/project`` might fail, displaying an error message ``fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository at \\'/project\\'``. To resolve this issue, you can designate the ``/project`` directory as safe by setting the IDF_GIT_SAFE_DIR environment variable during the Docker container startup. For instance, you can achieve this by including ``-e IDF_GIT_SAFE_DIR=\\'/project\\'`` as a parameter. Additionally, multiple directories can be specified by using a ``:`` separator. To entirely disable this git security check, ``*`` can be used.\\n\\nTo build with a specific Docker image tag, specify it as ``espressif/idf:TAG``, for example:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    docker run --rm -v $PWD:/project -w /project -u $UID -e HOME=/tmp espressif/idf:release-v4.4 idf.py build\\n\\nYou can check the up-to-date list of available tags at https://hub.docker.com/r/espressif/idf/tags.\\n\\nUsing the Image Interactively\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIt is also possible to do builds interactively, to debug build issues or test the automated build scripts. Start the container with ``-i -t`` flags:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    docker run --rm -v $PWD:/project -w /project -u $UID -e HOME=/tmp -it espressif/idf\\n\\nThen inside the container, use ``idf.py`` as usual:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    idf.py menuconfig\\n    idf.py build\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Commands which communicate with the development board, such as ``idf.py flash`` and ``idf.py monitor`` does not work in the container, unless the serial port is passed through into the container. This can be done with Docker for Linux with the `device option`_. However, currently, this is not possible with Docker for Windows (https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/1018) and Docker for Mac (https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/900). This limitation may be overcome by using `remote serial ports`_. An example of how to do this can be found in the following `using remote serial port`_ section.\\n\\n\\n.. _using remote serial port:\\n\\nUsing Remote Serial Port\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe `RFC2217`_ (Telnet) protocol can be used to remotely connect to a serial port. For more information please see the `remote serial ports`_ documentation in the ESP tool project. This method can also be used to access the serial port inside a Docker container if it cannot be accessed directly. Following is an example of how to use the Flash command from within a Docker container.\\n\\nOn host install and start ``esp_rfc2217_server``:\\n\\n* On Windows, the package is available as a one-file bundled executable created by ``pyinstaller`` and it can be downloaded from the `esptool releases`_ page in a ZIP archive along with other ESP tool utilities:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    esp_rfc2217_server -v -p 4000 COM3\\n\\n* On Linux or macOS, the package is available as part of ``esptool``, which can be found in the ESP-IDF environment or by installing using ``pip``:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    pip install esptool\\n\\nAnd then starting the server by executing\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    esp_rfc2217_server.py -v -p 4000 /dev/ttyUSB0\\n\\nNow the device attached to the host can be flashed from inside a Docker container by using:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    docker run --rm -v <host_path>:/<container_path> -w /<container_path> espressif/idf idf.py --port \\'rfc2217://host.docker.internal:4000?ign_set_control\\' flash\\n\\nPlease make sure that ``<host_path>`` is properly set to your project path on the host, and ``<container_path>`` is set as a working directory inside the container with the ``-w`` option. The ``host.docker.internal`` is a special Docker DNS name to access the host. This can be replaced with a host IP if necessary.\\n\\n\\nBuilding Custom Images\\n======================\\n\\nThe Docker file in ESP-IDF repository provides several build arguments which can be used to customize the Docker image:\\n\\n- ``IDF_CLONE_URL``: URL of the repository to clone ESP-IDF from. Can be set to a custom URL when working with a fork of ESP-IDF. The default is ``https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git``.\\n- ``IDF_CLONE_BRANCH_OR_TAG``: Name of a git branch or tag used when cloning ESP-IDF. This value is passed to the ``git clone`` command using the ``--branch`` argument. The default is ``master``.\\n- ``IDF_CHECKOUT_REF``: If this argument is set to a non-empty value, ``git checkout $IDF_CHECKOUT_REF`` command performs after cloning. This argument can be set to the SHA of the specific commit to check out, for example, if some specific commit on a release branch is desired.\\n- ``IDF_CLONE_SHALLOW``: If this argument is set to a non-empty value, ``--depth=1 --shallow-submodules`` arguments are used when performing ``git clone``. Depth can be customized using ``IDF_CLONE_SHALLOW_DEPTH``. Doing a shallow clone significantly reduces the amount of data downloaded and the size of the resulting Docker image. However, if switching to a different branch in such a \"shallow\" repository is necessary, an additional ``git fetch origin <branch>`` command must be executed first.\\n- ``IDF_CLONE_SHALLOW_DEPTH``: This argument specifies the depth value to use when doing a shallow clone. If not set, ``--depth=1`` will be used. This argument has effect only if ``IDF_CLONE_SHALLOW`` is used. Use this argument if you are building a Docker image for a branch, and the image has to contain the latest tag on that branch. To determine the required depth, run ``git describe`` for the given branch and note the offset number. Increment it by 1, then use it as the value of this argument. The resulting image will contain the latest tag on the branch, and consequently ``git describe`` command inside the Docker image will work as expected.\\n- ``IDF_INSTALL_TARGETS``: Comma-separated list of ESP-IDF targets to install toolchains for, or ``all`` to install toolchains for all targets. Selecting specific targets reduces the amount of data downloaded and the size of the resulting Docker image. The default is ``all``.\\n\\nTo use these arguments, pass them via the ``--build-arg`` command line option. For example, the following command builds a Docker image with a shallow clone of ESP-IDF v4.4.1 and tools for ESP32-C3 only:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    docker build -t idf-custom:v4.4.1-esp32c3 \\\\\\n        --build-arg IDF_CLONE_BRANCH_OR_TAG=v4.4.1 \\\\\\n        --build-arg IDF_CLONE_SHALLOW=1 \\\\\\n        --build-arg IDF_INSTALL_TARGETS=esp32c3 \\\\\\n        tools/docker\\n\\n.. _remote serial ports: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esptool/remote-serial-ports.html\\n.. _RFC2217: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2217.txt\\n.. _esptool releases: https://github.com/espressif/esptool/releases\\n.. _device option: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities\\n',\n",
       " '*********************\\nIDF Component Manager\\n*********************\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThe IDF Component Manager is a tool that downloads dependencies for any ESP-IDF CMake project. The download happens automatically during a run of CMake. It can source components either from the `component registry <https://components.espressif.com>`__ or from a Git repository.\\n\\nA list of components can be found on `<https://components.espressif.com/>`__.\\n\\nFor detailed information about the IDF Component Manager, see the `IDF Component Manager and ESP Component Registry Documentation <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/idf-component-manager/en/latest/>`__.\\n\\nUsing with a Project\\n====================\\n\\nDependencies for each component in the project are defined in a separate manifest file named ``idf_component.yml`` placed in the root of the component. The manifest file template can be created by running ``idf.py create-manifest``. By default, a manifest file is created for the main component. You can explicitly either specify the directory where the manifest should be created using the ``--path`` option or specify the component in your ``components`` folder using ``--component=my_component``. The ``create-manifest`` command can be run in the following ways:\\n\\n- ``idf.py create-manifest`` creates a manifest file for the main component\\n- ``idf.py create-manifest --component=my_component`` creates a manifest file for the component **my_component** in the ``components`` directory\\n- ``idf.py create-manifest --path=\"../../my_component\"`` creates a manifest file for the component **my_component** in the ``my_component`` directory\\n\\nWhen a new manifest is added to one of the components in the project, it is necessary to reconfigure the project manually by running ``idf.py reconfigure``. The build will then track changes in ``idf_component.yml`` manifests and automatically trigger CMake when necessary.\\n\\nTo add a dependency to a component (e.g., ``my_component``) in your ESP-IDF project, you can run the command ``idf.py add-dependency DEPENDENCY``. The ``DEPENDENCY`` argument represents an additional component managed by the IDF Component Manager that ``my_component`` depends on. It is defined in the format ``namespace/name=1.0.0``, where `namespace/name` is the name of the component and `=1.0.0` is a version range of the component, see the `Versioning Documentation <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/idf-component-manager/en/latest/reference/versioning.html>`__. By default, dependencies are added to the main component. You can either explicitly specify a directory where the manifest is located using the ``--path`` option, or specify the component in your ``components`` folder using ``--component=my_component``. The ``add-dependency`` command can be run in the following ways:\\n\\n- ``idf.py add-dependency example/cmp`` adds a dependency on the most recent version of ``example/cmp`` to the main component\\n- ``idf.py add-dependency --component=my_component example/cmp<=3.3.3`` adds a dependency on the version ``<=3.3.3`` of ``example/cmp`` to the component ``my_component`` in the ``components`` directory\\n- ``idf.py add-dependency --path=\"../../my_component\" example/cmp^3.3.3`` adds a dependency on the version ``^3.3.3`` of ``example/cmp`` to the component ``my_component`` in the ``my_component`` directory\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The command ``add-dependency`` adds dependencies to your project explicitly from the `Espressif Component Registry <https://components.espressif.com/>`__.\\n\\nTo update dependencies of the ESP-IDF project, you can run the command ``idf.py update-dependencies``. You can also specify the path to the project directory using ``--project-dir PATH``.\\n\\nThere is an example application :example:`build_system/cmake/component_manager` that uses components installed by the component manager.\\n\\nIt is not necessary to have a manifest for components that do not need any managed dependencies.\\n\\nWhen CMake configures the project (e.g., ``idf.py reconfigure``) component manager does a few things:\\n\\n- Processes ``idf_component.yml`` manifests for every component in the project and recursively solves dependencies.\\n- Creates a ``dependencies.lock`` file in the root of the project with a full list of dependencies.\\n- Downloads all dependencies to the ``managed_components`` directory.\\n\\nThe lock file ``dependencies.lock`` and the content of the ``managed_components`` directory are not supposed to be modified by a user. When the component manager runs, it always makes sure they are up to date. If these files were accidentally modified, it is possible to re-run the component manager by triggering CMake with ``idf.py reconfigure``.\\n\\nYou may set the build property ``DEPENDENCIES_LOCK`` to specify the lock-file path in the top-level CMakeLists.txt. For example, adding ``idf_build_set_property(DEPENDENCIES_LOCK dependencies.lock.${IDF_TARGET})`` before ``project(PROJECT_NAME)`` could help generate different lock files for different targets.\\n\\nCreating a Project From an Example\\n==================================\\n\\nSome components on the registry contain example projects. To create a new project from an example you can run the command ``idf.py create-project-from-example EXAMPLE``. The ``EXAMPLE`` argument should be in the format ``namespace/name=1.0.0:example`` where `namespace/name` is the name of the component, `=1.0.0` is a version range of the component (see the `Versioning Documentation <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/idf-component-manager/en/latest/reference/versioning.html>`__) and `example` is the example\\'s name. You can find the list of examples for every component and the command to start a project for it in the `Espressif Component Registry <https://components.espressif.com/>`__.\\n\\nDefining Dependencies in the Manifest\\n=====================================\\n\\nYou can easily define dependencies in the manifest file ``idf_component.yml`` by editing it directly in the text editor. Below are some basic examples that demonstrate how to define dependencies.\\n\\nYou can define a dependency from the registry by specifying the component name and the version range:\\n\\n.. code-block:: yaml\\n\\n    dependencies:\\n      # Define a dependency from the registry (https://components.espressif.com/component/example/cmp)\\n      example/cmp: \">=1.0.0\"\\n\\nTo define a dependency from a Git repository, provide the path to the component within the repository and the repository\\'s URL:\\n\\n.. code-block:: yaml\\n\\n    dependencies:\\n      # Define a dependency from a Git repository\\n      test_component:\\n        path: test_component\\n        git: ssh://git@gitlab.com/user/components.git\\n\\nDuring the development of components, you can use components from a local directory by specifying either a relative or an absolute path:\\n\\n.. code-block:: yaml\\n\\n      dependencies:\\n        # Define local dependency with relative path\\n        some_local_component:\\n          path: ../../projects/component\\n\\nFor detailed information about the manifest file format, see `Manifest File Format Documentation <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/idf-component-manager/en/latest/reference/manifest_file.html>`__.\\n\\nDisabling the Component Manager\\n===============================\\n\\nThe component manager can be explicitly disabled by setting the ``IDF_COMPONENT_MANAGER`` environment variable to ``0``.\\n',\n",
       " 'QEMU Emulator\\n=============\\n\\nEspressif maintains a `fork <https://github.com/espressif/qemu>`_ of the QEMU emulator with support for {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. This fork implements emulation of the CPU, memory, and several peripherals of {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. For more information about QEMU for {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, see the `documentation <https://github.com/espressif/esp-toolchain-docs/blob/main/qemu/README.md>`_.\\n\\n:doc:`idf.py<idf-py>` allows for running and debugging applications in QEMU. This is a convenient way to test applications without having to flash them to real hardware.\\n\\nPrerequisites\\n-------------\\n\\nTo use QEMU with ``idf.py`` you first need to install the above-mentioned fork of QEMU. ESP-IDF provides pre-built binaries for x86_64 and arm64 Linux and macOS, as well as x86_64 Windows. Before you use the pre-built binaries on Linux and macOS platroms please install system dependencies:\\n\\n- Ubuntu and Debian:\\n\\n.. code-block:: console\\n\\n    sudo apt-get install -y libgcrypt20 libglib2.0-0 libpixman-1-0 libsdl2-2.0-0 libslirp0\\n\\n- CentOS:\\n\\n.. code-block:: console\\n\\n    sudo yum install -y --enablerepo=powertools libgcrypt glib2 pixman SDL2 libslirp\\n\\n- Arch:\\n\\n.. code-block:: console\\n\\n    sudo pacman -S --needed libgcrypt glib2 pixman sdl2 libslirp\\n\\n- macOS:\\n\\n.. code-block:: console\\n\\n    brew install libgcrypt glib pixman sdl2 libslirp\\n\\nThen install the pre-built binaries with the following command:\\n\\n.. code-block:: console\\n\\n    python $IDF_PATH/tools/idf_tools.py install qemu-xtensa qemu-riscv32\\n\\nAfter installing QEMU, make sure it is added to PATH by running ``. ./export.sh`` in the IDF directory.\\n\\nIf you are using a different platform, you need to build QEMU from source. Refer to official QEMU documentation for instructions.\\n\\nUsage\\n-----\\n\\nRunning an Application\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nTo run an IDF application in QEMU, use the following command:\\n\\n.. code-block:: console\\n\\n    idf.py qemu monitor\\n\\nThis command builds the application, starts QEMU and opens :doc:`IDF monitor <idf-monitor>`, connecting it to the emulated UART port. You can see the console output of the application and interact with it. IDF Monitor also provides automatic decoding of panic backtraces and UART core dumps.\\n\\nDebugging\\n~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nTo debug an application in QEMU, use the following command:\\n\\n.. code-block:: console\\n\\n    idf.py qemu gdb\\n\\nThis command builds the application, starts QEMU with the GDB server enabled, and opens an interactive GDB session. You can use GDB to debug the application as if it was running on real hardware.\\n\\nTo see console output while debugging in QEMU, use two terminals.\\n\\n* In the first terminal, run:\\n\\n  .. code-block:: console\\n\\n    idf.py qemu --gdb monitor\\n\\n  This command starts QEMU and IDF Monitor, and tells QEMU to wait for a GDB connection.\\n\\n* In the second terminal, run:\\n\\n  .. code-block:: console\\n\\n    idf.py gdb\\n\\n  This command starts an interactive GDB sessions and connects it to QEMU. You can now debug the application, and the console output will be visible in the first terminal.\\n\\nIt is also possible to run QEMU without the IDF Monitor:\\n\\n.. code-block:: console\\n\\n    idf.py qemu\\n\\nIn this case, the IDF Monitor is not used, and you can interact with QEMU process directly. To switch between the emulated UART console and QEMU console (\"QEMU monitor\"), use Ctrl-A shortcut. For example, to exit QEMU, press Ctrl-A, then type ``q`` and press Enter. You can use the QEMU console to enter commands, such as for inspecting registers and memory.\\n\\nGraphics Support\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nQEMU supports a virtual framebuffer device. This device doesn\\'t exist in the real {IDF_TARGET_NAME} hardware, but it can be used to test graphics applications in QEMU.\\n\\nTo launch QEMU with a virtual framebuffer device enabled, use the following command:\\n\\n.. code-block:: console\\n\\n    idf.py qemu --graphics monitor\\n\\nWhen the ``--graphics`` option is used, QEMU opens an additional window where the framebuffer contents are displayed.\\n\\nTo use the virtual framebuffer device in your application, you can add the `espressif/esp_lcd_qemu_rgb <https://components.espressif.com/components/espressif/esp_lcd_qemu_rgb>`_ component to your project. This component provides an esp_lcd compatible driver for the virtual framebuffer device.\\n',\n",

       " 'IDF Frontend - ``idf.py``\\n*************************\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThe ``idf.py`` command-line tool provides a front-end for easily managing your project builds, deployment and debugging, and more. It manages several tools, for example:\\n\\n- CMake_, which configures the project to be built.\\n- Ninja_, which builds the project.\\n- `esptool.py`_, which flashes the target.\\n\\nThe :ref:`Step 5. First Steps on ESP-IDF <get-started-configure>` contains a brief introduction on how to set up ``idf.py`` to configure, build, and flash projects.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n  ``idf.py`` should be run in an ESP-IDF project directory, i.e., a directory containing a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file. Older style projects that contain a ``Makefile`` will not work with ``idf.py``.\\n\\nCommands\\n========\\n\\nStart a New Project: ``create-project``\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    idf.py create-project <project name>\\n\\nThis command creates a new ESP-IDF project. Additionally, the folder where the project will be created in can be specified by the ``--path`` option.\\n\\nCreate a New Component: ``create-component``\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    idf.py create-component <component name>\\n\\nThis command creates a new component, which will have a minimum set of files necessary for building. The ``-C`` option can be used to specify the directory the component will be created in. For more information about components see the :ref:`Component CMakeLists Files <component-directories>`.\\n\\n.. _selecting-idf-target:\\n\\nSelect the Target Chip: ``set-target``\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nESP-IDF supports multiple targets (chips). A full list of supported targets in your version of ESP-IDF can be seen by running ``idf.py --list-targets``.\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    idf.py set-target <target>\\n\\nThis command sets the current project target.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n    ``idf.py set-target`` will clear the build directory and re-generate the ``sdkconfig`` file from scratch. The old ``sdkconfig`` file will be saved as ``sdkconfig.old``.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The behavior of the ``idf.py set-target`` command is equivalent to:\\n\\n    1. clearing the build directory (``idf.py fullclean``)\\n    2. removing the sdkconfig file (``mv sdkconfig sdkconfig.old``)\\n    3. configuring the project with the new target (``idf.py -DIDF_TARGET=esp32 reconfigure``)\\n\\nIt is also possible to pass the desired ``IDF_TARGET`` as an environment variable (e.g., ``export IDF_TARGET=esp32s2``) or as a CMake variable (e.g., ``-DIDF_TARGET=esp32s2`` argument to CMake or  ``idf.py`` ). Setting the environment variable is a convenient method if you mostly work with one type of the chip.\\n\\nTo specify the default value of ``IDF_TARGET`` for a given project, please add the ``CONFIG_IDF_TARGET`` option to the project\\'s ``sdkconfig.defaults`` file, e.g., ``CONFIG_IDF_TARGET=\"esp32s2\"``. This value of the option will be used if ``IDF_TARGET`` is not specified by other methods, such as using an environment variable, a CMake variable, or the ``idf.py set-target`` command.\\n\\nIf the target has not been set by any of these methods, the build system will default to ``esp32`` target.\\n\\nStart the Graphical Configuration Tool: ``menuconfig``\\n------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  idf.py menuconfig\\n\\nBuild the Project: ``build``\\n----------------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  idf.py build\\n\\nThis command builds the project found in the current directory. This can involve multiple steps:\\n\\n  - Create the build directory if needed. The sub-directory ``build`` is used to hold build output, although this can be changed with the ``-B`` option.\\n  - Run CMake_ as necessary to configure the project and generate build files for the main build tool.\\n  - Run the main build tool (Ninja_ or `GNU Make`). By default, the build tool is automatically detected but it can be explicitly set by passing the ``-G`` option to ``idf.py``.\\n\\nBuilding is incremental, so if no source files or configuration has changed since the last build, nothing will be done.\\n\\nAdditionally, the command can be run with ``app``, ``bootloader`` and ``partition-table`` arguments to build only the app, bootloader or partition table as applicable.\\n\\nRemove the Build Output: ``clean``\\n----------------------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  idf.py clean\\n\\nThis command removes the project build output files from the build directory, and the project will be fully rebuilt on next build. Using this command does not remove the CMake configuration output inside the build folder.\\n\\nDelete the Entire Build Contents: ``fullclean``\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  idf.py fullclean\\n\\nThis command deletes the entire \"build\" directory contents, which includes all CMake configuration output. The next time the project is built, CMake will configure it from scratch. Note that this option recursively deletes **all** files in the build directory, so use with care. Project configuration is not deleted.\\n\\nFlash the Project: ``flash``\\n----------------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  idf.py flash\\n\\nThis command automatically builds the project if necessary, and then flash it to the target. You can use ``-p`` and ``-b`` options to set serial port name and flasher baud rate, respectively.\\n\\n.. note:: The environment variables ``ESPPORT`` and ``ESPBAUD`` can be used to set default values for the ``-p`` and ``-b`` options, respectively. Providing these options on the command line overrides the default.\\n\\nSimilarly to the ``build`` command, the command can be run with ``app``, ``bootloader`` and ``partition-table`` arguments to flash only the app, bootloader or partition table as applicable.\\n\\nHints on How to Resolve Errors\\n==============================\\n\\n``idf.py`` will try to suggest hints on how to resolve errors. It works with a database of hints stored in :idf_file:`tools/idf_py_actions/hints.yml` and the hints will be printed if a match is found for the given error. The menuconfig target is not supported at the moment by automatic hints on resolving errors.\\n\\nThe ``--no-hints`` argument of ``idf.py`` can be used to turn the hints off in case they are not desired.\\n\\nImportant Notes\\n===============\\n\\nMultiple ``idf.py`` commands can be combined into one. For example, ``idf.py -p COM4 clean flash monitor`` will clean the source tree, then build the project and flash it to the target before running the serial monitor.\\n\\nThe order of multiple ``idf.py`` commands on the same invocation is not important, as they will automatically be executed in the correct order for everything to take effect (e.g., building before flashing, erasing before flashing).\\n\\nFor commands that are not known to ``idf.py``, an attempt to execute them as a build system target will be made.\\n\\nThe command ``idf.py`` supports `shell autocompletion <https://click.palletsprojects.com/shell-completion/>`_ for bash, zsh and fish shells.\\n\\nTo enable autocompletion for ``idf.py``, use the ``export`` command (:ref:`Step 4. Set up the environment variables <get-started-set-up-env>`). Autocompletion is initiated by pressing the TAB key. Type ``idf.py -`` and press the TAB key to autocomplete options.\\n\\nThe autocomplete support for PowerShell is planned in the future.\\n\\nAdvanced Commands\\n=================\\n\\nOpen the Documentation: ``docs``\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  idf.py docs\\n\\nThis command opens the documentation for the projects target and ESP-IDF version in the browser.\\n\\nShow Size: ``size``\\n-------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  idf.py size\\n\\nThis command prints app size information including the occupied RAM and flash and section (i.e., .bss) sizes.\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  idf.py size-components\\n\\nSimilarly, this command prints the same information for each component used in the project.\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  idf.py size-files\\n\\nThis command prints size information per source file in the project.\\n\\nOptions\\n^^^^^^^\\n\\n- ``--format`` specifies the output format with available options: ``text``, ``csv``, ``json``, default being ``text``.\\n- ``--output-file`` optionally specifies the name of the file to print the command output to instead of the standard output.\\n\\nReconfigure the Project: ``reconfigure``\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  idf.py reconfigure\\n\\nThis command forces CMake_ to be rerun regardless of whether it is necessary. It is unnecessary during normal usage, but can be useful after adding/removing files from the source tree, or when modifying CMake cache variables. For example, ``idf.py -DNAME=\\'VALUE\\' reconfigure`` can be used to set variable ``NAME`` in CMake cache to value ``VALUE``.\\n\\nClean the Python Byte Code: ``python-clean``\\n--------------------------------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  idf.py python-clean\\n\\nThis command deletes generated python byte code from the ESP-IDF directory. The byte code may cause issues when switching between ESP-IDF and Python versions. It is advised to run this target after switching versions of Python.\\n\\nGenerate a UF2 Binary: ``uf2``\\n------------------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  idf.py uf2\\n\\nThis command generates a UF2 (`USB Flashing Format <https://github.com/microsoft/uf2>`_) binary ``uf2.bin`` in the build directory. This file includes all the necessary binaries (bootloader, app, and partition table) for flashing the target.\\n\\nThis UF2 file can be copied to a USB mass storage device exposed by another ESP running the `ESP USB Bridge <https://github.com/espressif/esp-usb-bridge>`_ project. The bridge MCU will use it to flash the target MCU. This is as simple as copying (or \"drag-and-dropping\") the file to the exposed disk accessed by a file explorer in your machine.\\n\\nTo generate a UF2 binary for the application only (not including the bootloader and partition table), use the ``uf2-app`` command.\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  idf.py uf2-app\\n\\nRead Otadata Partition: ``read-otadata``\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  idf.py read-otadata\\n\\nThis command prints the contents of the ``otadata`` partition which stores the information about the currently selected OTA app slot. Refer to :doc:`/api-reference/system/ota` for more about the ``otadata`` partition.\\n\\nGlobal Options\\n==============\\n\\nTo list all available root level options, run ``idf.py --help``. To list options that are specific for a subcommand, run ``idf.py <command> --help``, e.g., ``idf.py monitor --help``. Here is a list of some useful options:\\n\\n- ``-C <dir>`` allows overriding the project directory from the default current working directory.\\n- ``-B <dir>`` allows overriding the build directory from the default ``build`` subdirectory of the project directory.\\n- ``--ccache`` enables CCache_ when compiling source files if the CCache_ tool is installed. This can dramatically reduce the build time.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n    Note that some older versions of CCache_ may exhibit bugs on some platforms, so if files are not rebuilt as expected, try disabling CCache_ and rebuiling the project. To enable CCache_ by default, set the ``IDF_CCACHE_ENABLE`` environment variable to a non-zero value.\\n\\n- ``-v`` flag causes both ``idf.py`` and the build system to produce verbose build output. This can be useful for debugging build problems.\\n- ``--cmake-warn-uninitialized`` (or ``-w``)  causes CMake to print uninitialized variable warnings found in the project directory only. This only controls CMake variable warnings inside CMake itself, not other types of build warnings. This option can also be set permanently by setting the ``IDF_CMAKE_WARN_UNINITIALIZED`` environment variable to a non-zero value.\\n- ``--no-hints`` flag disables hints on resolving errors and disable capturing output.\\n\\nPassing arguments via a ``@file``\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nIt is possible to pass multiple arguments to ``idf.py`` via a file. The file or path to the file must be annotated with ``@`` at the beginning. Arguments in the file can be separated by newlines or spaces and are expanded exactly as if they had appeared in that order on the idf.py command line.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s have a file `custom_flash.txt`:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n  flash --baud 115200\\n\\nThen the command can be executed as: ``idf.py @custom_flash.txt monitor``\\n\\nArguments from a file can be combined with additional command line arguments, and multiple files annotated with ``@`` can be used simultaneously. For instance, if there is a second file ``another_config.txt``, both can be utilized by specifying ``idf.py @custom_flash.txt @another_config.txt monitor``.\\n\\nA further example of how this argument file can be used, e.g., creating configuration profile files via @filename, is in the :example_file:`Multiple Build Configurations Example <build_system/cmake/multi_config/README.md>`.\\n\\n.. _cmake: https://cmake.org\\n.. _ninja: https://ninja-build.org\\n.. _esptool.py: https://github.com/espressif/esptool/#readme\\n.. _CCache: https://ccache.dev/\\n',\n",
       " 'Downloadable IDF Tools\\n==========================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThe ESP-IDF build process relies on a number of tools: cross-compiler toolchains, CMake build system, and others.\\n\\nInstalling the tools using an OS-specific package manager (e.g., apt, yum, brew, etc.) is the preferred method, when the required version of the tool is available. This recommendation is reflected in the :doc:`Get Started <../../get-started/index>`. For example, on Linux and macOS, it is recommended to install CMake using an OS package manager.\\n\\nHowever, some of the tools are specific to ESP-IDF and are not available in OS package repositories. Furthermore, different ESP-IDF versions require different tool versions for proper operation. To solve these two problems, ESP-IDF provides a set of scripts that can download and install the correct tool versions and set up the environment accordingly.\\n\\nThe rest of the document refers to these downloadable tools simply as \"tools\". Other kinds of tools used in ESP-IDF are:\\n\\n* Python scripts bundled with ESP-IDF such as ``idf.py``\\n* Python packages installed from PyPI\\n\\nThe following sections explain the installation method and provide the list of tools installed on each platform.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    This document is provided for advanced users who need to customize their installation, users who wish to understand the installation process, and ESP-IDF developers.\\n\\n    If you are looking for instructions on how to install the tools, see :doc:`Get Started <../../get-started/index>`.\\n\\n\\nTools Metadata File\\n-------------------\\n\\nThe list of tools and tool versions required for each platform is located in :idf_file:`tools/tools.json`. The schema of this file is defined by :idf_file:`tools/tools_schema.json`.\\n\\nThis file is used by the :idf_file:`tools/idf_tools.py` script when installing the tools or setting up the environment variables.\\n\\n.. _idf-tools-path:\\n\\nTools Installation Directory\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThe ``IDF_TOOLS_PATH`` environment variable specifies the location where the tools are to be downloaded and installed. If not set, the default location will be ``HOME/.espressif`` on Linux and macOS, and ``%USER_PROFILE%\\\\.espressif`` on Windows.\\n\\nInside the ``IDF_TOOLS_PATH`` directory, the tools installation scripts create the following directories and files:\\n\\n- ``dist`` — where the archives of the tools are downloaded.\\n- ``tools`` — where the tools are extracted. The tools are extracted into subdirectories: ``tools/TOOL_NAME/VERSION/``. This arrangement allows different versions of tools to be installed side by side.\\n- ``idf-env.json`` — user install options, such as targets and features, are stored in this file. Targets are selected chip targets for which tools are installed and kept up-to-date. Features determine the Python package set which should be installed. These options will be discussed later.\\n- ``python_env`` —  not related to the tools; virtual Python environments are installed in the sub-directories. Note that the Python environment directory can be placed elsewhere by setting the ``IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH`` environment variable.\\n- ``espidf.constraints.*.txt`` — one constraint file for each ESP-IDF release containing Python package version requirements.\\n\\nGitHub Assets Mirror\\n--------------------\\n\\nMost of the tools downloaded by the tools installer are GitHub Release Assets, which are files attached to a software release on GitHub.\\n\\nIf GitHub downloads are inaccessible or slow to access, a GitHub assets mirror can be configured.\\n\\nTo use Espressif\\'s download server, set the environment variable ``IDF_GITHUB_ASSETS`` to ``dl.espressif.com/github_assets``, or ``dl.espressif.cn/github_assets`` for faster download in China. When the install process is downloading a tool from ``github.com``, the URL will be rewritten to use this server instead.\\n\\nAny mirror server can be used provided the URL matches the ``github.com`` download URL format. For any GitHub asset URL that the install process downloads, it will replace ``https://github.com`` with ``https://${IDF_GITHUB_ASSETS}``.\\n\\n.. note:: The Espressif download server currently does not mirror everything from GitHub, but only files attached as Assets to some releases, as well as source archives for some releases.\\n\\n\\n``idf_tools.py`` Script\\n-----------------------\\n\\nThe :idf_file:`tools/idf_tools.py` script bundled with ESP-IDF performs several functions:\\n\\n* ``install``: Download the tool into the ``${IDF_TOOLS_PATH}/dist`` directory and extract it into ``${IDF_TOOLS_PATH}/tools/TOOL_NAME/VERSION``.\\n\\n  The ``install`` command accepts the list of tools to install in the ``TOOL_NAME`` or ``TOOL_NAME@VERSION`` format. If ``all`` is given, all the tools, including required and optional ones, are installed. If no argument or ``required`` is given, only the required tools are installed.\\n\\n* ``download``: Similar to ``install`` but doesn\\'t extract the tools. An optional ``--platform`` argument may be used to download the tools for the specific platform.\\n\\n* ``export``: Lists the environment variables that need to be set to use the installed tools. For most of the tools, setting the ``PATH`` environment variable is sufficient, but some tools require extra environment variables.\\n\\n  The environment variables can be listed in either ``shell`` or ``key-value`` formats, which can be set using the ``--format`` parameter:\\n\\n  - ``export`` optional parameters:\\n\\n    - ``--unset``: Creates a statement that unsets specific global variables and restores the environment to its state before calling ``export.{sh/fish}``.\\n    - ``--add_paths_extras``: Adds extra ESP-IDF-related paths of ``$PATH`` to ``${IDF_TOOLS_PATH}/esp-idf.json``, which is used to remove global variables when the active ESP-IDF environment is deactivated. For example, while processing the ``export.{sh/fish}`` script, if new paths are added to the global variable ``$PATH``, this option saves these new paths to the ``${IDF_TOOLS_PATH}/esp-idf.json`` file.\\n\\n  - ``shell``: Produces output suitable for evaluation in the shell. For example, produce the following output on Linux and macOS:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: none\\n\\n        export PATH=\"/home/user/.espressif/tools/tool/v1.0.0/bin:$PATH\"\\n\\n    Produce the following output on Windows:\\n\\n    .. code-block:: none\\n\\n        set \"PATH=C:\\\\Users\\\\user\\\\.espressif\\\\tools\\\\v1.0.0\\\\bin;%PATH%\"\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Exporting environment variables in Powershell format is not supported at the moment. ``key-value`` format may be used instead.\\n\\n    The output of this command may be used to update the environment variables if the shell supports it. For example\\n\\n    .. code-block:: none\\n\\n        eval $($IDF_PATH/tools/idf_tools.py export)\\n\\n  - ``key-value``: Produces output in the ``VARIABLE=VALUE`` format that is suitable for parsing by other scripts\\n\\n    .. code-block:: none\\n\\n        PATH=/home/user/.espressif/tools/tool/v1.0.0:$PATH\\n\\n    Note that the script consuming this output has to perform expansion of ``$VAR`` or ``%VAR%`` patterns found in the output.\\n\\n* ``list``: Lists the known versions of the tools, and indicates which ones are installed.\\n\\n  The following option is available to customize the output.\\n\\n  - ``--outdated``: Lists only outdated versions of tools installed in ``IDF_TOOLS_PATH``.\\n\\n* ``check``: For each tool, checks whether the tool is available in the system path and in ``IDF_TOOLS_PATH``.\\n\\n* ``install-python-env``: Creates a Python virtual environment in the ``${IDF_TOOLS_PATH}/python_env`` directory or directly in the directory set by the ``IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH`` environment variable, and install the required Python packages there.\\n\\n  * An optional ``--features`` argument allows one to specify a comma-separated list of features to be added or removed.\\n\\n    #. A feature that begins with ``-`` will be removed, and features with ``+`` or without any sign will be added. Example syntax for removing feature ``XY`` is ``--features=-XY``, and for adding feature ``XY`` is ``--features=+XY`` or ``--features=XY``. If both removing and adding options are provided with the same feature, no operation is performed.\\n\\n    #. For each feature, a requirements file must exist. For example, feature ``XY`` is a valid feature if ``${IDF_PATH}/tools/requirements/requirements.XY.txt`` is an existing file with a list of Python packages to be installed.\\n\\n    #. There is one mandatory ``core`` feature ensuring the core functionality of ESP-IDF, e.g., build, flash, monitor, debug in console. There can be an arbitrary number of optional features.\\n\\n    #. The selected list of features is stored in ``idf-env.json``.\\n\\n    #. The requirement files contain a list of the desired Python packages to be installed and the ``espidf.constraints.*.txt`` file downloaded from https://dl.espressif.com and stored in ``${IDF_TOOLS_PATH}``, which contains the package version requirements for a given ESP-IDF version.\\n\\n  .. note::\\n\\n    Although **it is not recommended**, the download and use of constraint files can be disabled with the ``--no-constraints`` argument or setting the ``IDF_PYTHON_CHECK_CONSTRAINTS`` environment variable to ``no``.\\n\\n* ``check-python-dependencies``: Checks if all required Python packages are installed. Packages from ``${IDF_PATH}/tools/requirements/requirements.*.txt`` files selected by the feature list of ``idf-env.json`` are checked with the package versions specified in the ``espidf.constraints.*.txt`` file.\\n\\n  .. note::\\n\\n    The constraint file is downloaded with the ``install-python-env`` command. Similar to the ``install-python-env`` command, the use of constraint files can be disabled with the ``--no-constraints`` argument or setting the ``IDF_PYTHON_CHECK_CONSTRAINTS`` environment variable to ``no``.\\n\\n* ``uninstall``: Prints and removes tools that are currently not used by the active ESP-IDF version.\\n\\n  - ``--dry-run``: Prints installed unused tools.\\n  - ``--remove-archives``: Additionally removes all older versions of previously downloaded installation packages.\\n\\n.. _idf-tools-install:\\n\\nInstall Scripts\\n---------------\\n\\nShell-specific user-facing installation scripts are provided in the root directory of ESP-IDF repository to facilitate tools installation. These are:\\n\\n* ``install.bat`` for Windows Command Prompt\\n* ``install.ps1`` for Powershell\\n* ``install.sh`` for Bash\\n* ``install.fish`` for Fish\\n\\nApart from downloading and installing the tools in ``IDF_TOOLS_PATH``, these scripts prepare a Python virtual environment, and install the required packages into that environment.\\n\\nThese scripts accept optionally a comma-separated list of chip targets and ``--enable-*`` arguments for enabling features. These arguments are passed to the ``idf_tools.py`` script which stores them in ``idf-env.json``. Therefore, chip targets and features can be enabled incrementally.\\n\\nTo install tools for all chip targets, run the scripts without any optional arguments using ``idf_tools.py install --targets=all``. Similarly, to install Python packages for core ESP-IDF functionality, run ``idf_tools.py install-python-env --features=core``.\\n\\nIt is also possible to install tools for specific chip targets. For example, ``install.sh esp32`` installs tools only for ESP32. See :ref:`Step 3. Set up the Tools <get-started-set-up-tools>` for more examples.\\n\\n``install.sh --enable-XY`` enables feature ``XY`` (by running ``idf_tools.py install-python-env --features=core,XY``).\\n\\n.. _idf-tools-export:\\n\\nExport Scripts\\n--------------\\n\\nSince the installed tools are not permanently added to the user or system ``PATH`` environment variable, an extra step is required to use them in the command line. The following scripts modify the environment variables in the current shell to make the correct versions of the tools available:\\n\\n* ``export.bat`` for Windows Command Prompt\\n* ``export.ps1`` for Powershell\\n* ``export.sh`` for Bash\\n* ``export.fish`` for Fish\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    To modify the shell environment in Bash, ``export.sh`` must be \"sourced\" by using the ``. ./export.sh`` command. Please ensure to include the leading dot and space.\\n\\n    ``export.sh`` may be used with shells other than Bash (such as zsh). However, in this case, it is required to set the ``IDF_PATH`` environment variable before running the script. When used in Bash, the script guesses the ``IDF_PATH`` value from its own location.\\n\\nIn addition to calling ``idf_tools.py``, these scripts list the directories that have been added to the ``PATH``.\\n\\nOther Installation Methods\\n--------------------------\\n\\nDepending on the environment, more user-friendly wrappers for ``idf_tools.py`` are provided:\\n\\n* :ref:`ESP-IDF Tools Installer <get-started-windows-tools-installer>` can download and install the tools. Internally the installer uses ``idf_tools.py``.\\n* `ESP-IDF Eclipse Plugin <https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/README.md>`_ includes a menu item to set up the tools. Internally the plugin calls ``idf_tools.py``.\\n* `VSCode ESP-IDF Extension <https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/blob/master/docs/tutorial/install.md>`_ includes an onboarding flow. This flow helps set up the tools. Although the extension does not rely on ``idf_tools.py``, the same installation method is used.\\n\\nCustom Installation\\n-------------------\\n\\nAlthough the methods above are recommended for ESP-IDF users, they are not a must for building ESP-IDF applications. ESP-IDF build system expects that all the necessary tools are installed somewhere, and made available in the ``PATH``.\\n\\n.. _idf-tools-uninstall:\\n\\nUninstall ESP-IDF\\n-----------------\\n\\nUninstalling ESP-IDF requires removing both the tools and the environment variables that have been configured during the installation.\\n\\n* Windows users using the :ref:`Windows ESP-IDF Tools Installer <get-started-windows-tools-installer>` can simply run the uninstall wizard to remove ESP-IDF.\\n* To remove an installation performed by running the supported :ref:`install scripts <idf-tools-install>`, simply delete the :ref:`tools installation directory <idf-tools-path>` including the downloaded and installed tools. Any environment variables set by the :ref:`export scripts <idf-tools-export>` are not permanent and will not be present after opening a new environment.\\n* When dealing with a custom installation, in addition to deleting the tools as mentioned above, you may also need to manually revert any changes to environment variables or system paths that were made to accommodate the ESP-IDF tools (e.g., ``IDF_PYTHON_ENV_PATH`` or ``IDF_TOOLS_PATH``). If you manually copied any tools, you would need to track and delete those files manually.\\n* If you installed any plugins like the `ESP-IDF Eclipse Plugin <https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/README.md>`_ or `VSCode ESP-IDF Extension <https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/blob/master/docs/tutorial/install.md>`_, you should follow the specific uninstallation instructions described in the documentation of those components.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  Uninstalling the ESP-IDF tools does not remove any project files or your code. Be mindful of what you are deleting to avoid losing any work. If you are unsure about a step, refer back to the installation instructions.\\n\\n  These instructions assume that the tools were installed following the procedures in this provided document.

In this way, mesh networks can span very large physical areas and contain large numbers of devices. It is ideally suited for building automation, sensor networks, and other IoT solutions where tens, hundreds, or thousands of devices need to reliably and securely communicate with one another.\\n\\nBluetooth mesh is not a wireless communications technology, but a networking technology. This technology is dependent upon Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) - a wireless communications protocol stack.\\n\\nBuilt on top of Zephyr Bluetooth Mesh stack, the ESP-BLE-MESH implementation supports device provisioning and node control. It also supports such node features as Proxy, Relay, Low power and Friend.\\n\\nPlease see the :doc:`ble-mesh-architecture` for information about the implementation of ESP-BLE-MESH architecture and :doc:`ESP-BLE-MESH API Reference <../../api-reference/bluetooth/esp-ble-mesh>` for information about respective API.\\n\\nESP-BLE-MESH is implemented and certified based on the latest Mesh Profile v1.0.1, users can refer `here <https://launchstudio.bluetooth.com/ListingDetails/94304>`_ for the certification details of ESP-BLE-MESH.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_WIFI_MESH_SUPPORT\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n      If you are looking for Wi-Fi based implementation of mesh for {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, please check another product by Espressif called ESP-WIFI-MESH.

Check Hardware\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nBoth `ESP32-DevKitC`_ and `ESP-WROVER-KIT`_ development boards are supported for ESP-BLE-MESH implementation. You can choose particular board through menuconfig: :code:`idf.py menuconfig` > ``Example Configuration`` > ``Board selection for ESP-BLE-MESH``\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n  If you plan to use `ESP32-DevKitC`_, connect a RGB LED to GPIO pins 25, 26 and 27.\\n\\n\\nStep 2. Configure Software\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nEnter the :example:`bluetooth/esp_ble_mesh/onoff_models/onoff_server` example directory, run :code:`idf.py menuconfig` to select your board and then run :code:`idf.py build` to compile the example.\\n\\nStep 3. Upload Application to Nodes\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nAfter the :example:`bluetooth/esp_ble_mesh/onoff_models/onoff_server` example is compiled successfully, users can run :code:`idf.py flash` to upload the same generated binary files into each of the three development boards.\\n\\nOnce boards are powered on, the RGB LED on each board should turn **GREEN**.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/ble-mesh-device-power-on.png\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    ESP-BLE-MESH Devices Power On\\n\\nStep 4. Provision Nodes\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nIn this section, we will use the **nRF Mesh Android** App to demonstrate how to provision an unprovisioned device. Users can also get its iOS version from the App Store.\\n\\n4.1 Scanner\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe Scanner is App\\'s functionality to search for unprovisioned devices in range. Open the App, press **Scanner** at the bottom and the search will start. After a short while we should see three unprovisioned devices displayed.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/ble-mesh-scanner.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :height: 370\\n\\n    nRF Mesh - Scanner\\n\\n4.2 Identify\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nUsers can select any unprovisioned device, then the App will try to set up a connection with the selected device. After the Bluetooth LE connection is established successfully (sometimes users need to try multiple times to get connected), and proper ESP-BLE-MESH GATT Service is discovered, users can see the **IDENTIFY** interface button on the screen. The IDENTIFY operation can be used to tell users which device is going to be provisioned.\\n\\n.. note::\\n    The IDENTIFY operation also needs some cooperation on the device side, then users can see which device is in the provisioning process. Currently when pressing the **IDENTIFY** interface button, no signs can been seen from the device except from the log on the serial monitor.\\n\\nAfter the **IDENTIFY** interface button is pressed, users can see the **PROVISION** interface button.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/ble-mesh-identify-provision.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :height: 370\\n\\n    nRF Mesh - IDENTIFY - PROVISION\\n\\n4.3 Provision\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThen, the App will try to provision the unprovisioned device. When the device is provisioned successfully, the RGB LED on the board will turn off, and the App will implement the following procedures:\\n\\n#. Disconnect with the node\\n#. Try to reconnect with the node\\n#. Connect successfully and discover ESP-BLE-MESH GATT Service\\n#. Get Composition Data of the node and add AppKey to it\\n\\nWhen all the procedures are finished, the node is configured properly. And after pressing **OK**, users can see that unicast address is assigned, and Composition Data of the node is decoded successfully.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/ble-mesh-config-complete.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :height: 370\\n\\n    nRF Mesh - Configuration Complete\\n\\nSometimes in procedure 2, the App may fail to reconnect with the node. In this case, after pressing **OK**, users can see that only unicast address of the node has been assigned, but no Composition Data has been got. Then users need to press **CONNECT** on the top right, and the previously provisioned node will be displayed on the screen, and users need to choose it and try to connect with the node.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/ble-mesh-initial-config-fail.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :height: 370\\n\\n    nRF Mesh - Initial Configuration Failed\\n\\nAfter connecting successfully, the App will show the interface buttons which can be used to get Composition Data and add AppKey.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/ble-mesh-reconnect-initial-config.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :height: 370\\n\\n    nRF Mesh - Reconnect - Initial Configuration\\n\\nIf the device is the second or the third one which has been provisioned by the App, and after pressing **CONNECT**, users can see two or three nodes on the screen. In this situation, users can choose any device to connect with, once succeed then go back to the main screen to choose the node which needs to be configured.\\n\\nHere an example of three devices listed.\\n\\n* The left picture shows that the third device is provisioned successfully, but the App failed to connect with it. When it tries to reconnect with the third node, three nodes are displayed on the App.\\n* The right picture shows that after connecting with any node successfully, the App displays the information of the three nodes. Users can see that the App has got the Composition Data of the first and the second nodes, but for the third one, only the unicast address has been assigned to it while the Composition Data is unknown.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/ble-mesh-reconnect-three.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :height: 370\\n\\n    nRF Mesh - Reconnect - Three Nodes\\n\\n4.4 Configuration\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen provisioning and initial configuration are finished, users can start to configure the node, such as binding AppKey with each model with the elements, setting publication information to it, etc.\\n\\nExample below shows how to bind AppKey with Generic OnOff Server Model within the Primary Element.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/ble-mesh-model-bind-appkey.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :height: 370\\n\\n    nRF Mesh - Model Bind AppKey\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    No need to bind AppKey with the Configuration Server Model, since it only uses the DevKey to encrypt messages in the Upper Transport Layer.\\n\\nStep 5. Operate Network\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nAfter all the Generic OnOff Server Models within the three elements are bound with proper AppKey, users can use the App to turn on/off the RGB LED.\\n\\nIn the :example:`bluetooth/esp_ble_mesh/onoff_models/onoff_server` example, the first Generic OnOff Server Model is used to control the **RED** color, the second one is used to control the **GREEN** color and the third one is used to control the **BLUE** color.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/ble-mesh-generic-onoff.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :height: 370\\n\\n    nRF Mesh - Generic OnOff Control\\n\\nThe following screenshot shows different board with different color on.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/ble-mesh-three-nodes-on.png\\n    :align: center\\n\\n    Three ESP-BLE-MESH Nodes On\\n\\n.. note::\\n  For **nRF Mesh** iOS App [version 1.0.4], when the node contains more than one element, the App is not behaving correctly. If users try to turn on/off the second or the third Generic OnOff Server Model, the message sent by the App is destinated to the first Generic OnOff Server Model within the Primary Element.\\n\\n\\n.. _esp-ble-mesh-examples:\\n\\nESP-BLE-MESH Examples\\n=====================\\n\\n* :example_file:`OnOff Server <bluetooth/esp_ble_mesh/onoff_models/onoff_server/tutorial/BLE_Mesh_Node_OnOff_Server_Example_Walkthrough.md>` - shows the use of ESP-BLE-MESH as a node having a Configuration Server model and a Generic OnOff Server model.

       " 'ESP-BLE-MESH FAQ\\n================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThis document provides a summary of frequently asked questions about developing with ESP-BLE-MESH, and is divided into seven sections:\\n\\n* :ref:`ble-mesh-faq-provisioner-development`\\n* :ref:`ble-mesh-faq-node-development`\\n* :ref:`ble-mesh-faq-ble-mesh-and-wi-fi-coexistence`\\n* :ref:`ble-mesh-faq-fast-provisioning`\\n* :ref:`ble-mesh-faq-log-help`\\n* :ref:`ble-mesh-faq-example-help`\\n* :ref:`ble-mesh-faq-others`\\n\\nUsers could refer to the sections for quick answer to their questions. This document will be updated based on the feedback collected via various channels.\\n\\n\\n.. _ble-mesh-faq-provisioner-development:\\n\\n1. Provisioner Development\\n--------------------------\\n\\nGenerally, a Provisioner is used to provision unprovisioned devices and form a mesh network. And after provisioning, roles of the unprovisioned devices will be changed to those of a node.\\n\\n1.1 What Is the Flow for an Unprovisioned Device to Join ESP-BLE-MESH Network?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    There are two phases for a device to join ESP-BLE-MESH network via a Provisioner, namely, provisioning and configuration.\\n\\n    - The phase of provisioning is to assign unicast address, add NetKey and etc. to a device. By provisioning, the device joins the ESP-BLE-MESH network and its role is changed from an unprovisioned device to a node.\\n\\n    - The phase of configuration is to add AppKeys to the node and bind AppKeys to corresponding models. And some items are optional during configuration, including adding subscription addresses to the node, set publication information, etc. By configuration, the node can actually transmit messages to a Provisioner and receive messages from it.\\n\\n1.2 If a Provisioner Wants to Change States of a Node, What Requirements Should Be Met for a Provisioner?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    - Client model that corresponds to server model of the node is required.\\n    - NetKey and AppKey used to encrypt messages shall be owned by both the node and the Provisioner.\\n    - The address owned by the node shall be known, which could be its unicast address or subscription address.\\n\\n1.3 How Can NetKey and AppKey Be Used?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    - NetKey is used for encryption of messages in Network Layer. Nodes with the same NetKey are assumed to be in the same subnet while those with different NetKeys cannot communicate with each other.\\n    - AppKey is used for encryption of messages in Upper Transport Layer. If client model and server model are bound to different AppKeys, the communication cannot be achieved.\\n\\n1.4 How to Generate a NetKey or AppKey for Provisioner? Can We Use a Fixed NetKey or AppKey?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    - The API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_provisioner_add_local_net_key` can be used to add a NetKey with a fixed or random value.\\n    - The API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_provisioner_add_local_app_key` can be used to add an AppKey with a fixed or random value.\\n\\n1.5 Is the Unicast Address of Provisioner Fixed?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The value of :code:`prov_unicast_addr` in :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_prov_t` is used to set the unicast address of Provisioner, it can be set only once during initialization and cannot be changed afterwards.\\n\\n1.6 Can the Address of Provisioner Serve as Destination Address of the Node-reporting-status Message?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The unicast address of Provisioner can be set only once during initialization and cannot be changed afterwards. In theory, it can serve as the destination address of the node-reporting-status message, provided that the unicast address of the Provisioner is known by nodes. Nodes can know the unicast address of Provisioner during configuration since Provisioner sends messages to them with its unicast address used as the source address.\\n\\n    Subscription address can also be used. Provisioner subscribes to a group address or virtual address, and nodes send messages to the subscription address.\\n\\n1.7 Is the Unicast Address of the Node That Is Firstly Provisioned by ProvIsioner to ESP-BLE-MESH Network Fixed?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The value of :code:`prov_start_address` in :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_prov_t` is used to set the starting address when the Provisioner provisions unprovisioned devices, i.e., the unicast address of the node it firstly provisioned. It can be set only once during initialization and cannot be changed afterwards.\\n\\n1.8 Is the Unicast Address of the Node That Mobile App Firstly Provisioned Fixed?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The App will decide the unicast address, and currently most of them are fixed.\\n\\n1.9 How to Know Which Unprovisioned Device Is the ProvIsioner That Is Provisioning Currently?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The value of :code:`prov_attention` in :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_prov_t` is used by Provisioner set to unprovisioned device during provisioning. It can be set only once during initialization and cannot be changed afterwards. When the unprovisioned device is joining the mesh network, it can display in a specific way like flashing light to notify Provisioner that it is being provisioned.\\n\\n1.10 How Many Ways to Authenticate the Devices During Provisioning? Which Way Was Used in the :example:`provided examples <bluetooth/esp_ble_mesh>`?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    There are four authentication methods, i.e., No OOB, Static OOB, Output OOB and Input OOB. In the provided examples, No OOB is used.\\n\\n1.11 What Information Can Be Carried by the Advertising Packets of the Unprovisioned Device Before Provisioning into the Network?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    - Device UUID\\n    - OOB Info\\n    - URL Hash (optional)\\n\\n1.12 Can Such Information Be Used for Device Identification?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    For example, each unprovisioned device contains a unique Device UUID, which can be used for device identification.\\n\\n1.13 How Is the Unicast Address Assigned When the Node Provisioned by ProvIsioner Contains Multiple Elements?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    - Provisioner will assign an unicast address for the primary element of the node, and unicast address of the remaining elements are incremented one by one.\\n    - For example: If an unprovisioned device has three elements, i.e., the primary element, the second element and the third element. After provisioning, the primary element address of the node is 0x0002 while the second element address is 0x0003, and the third element address is 0x0004.\\n\\n1.14 How Can Provisioner Get and Parse the :ref:`Composition Data <ble-mesh-terminology-composition>` of Nodes Through Configuration Client Model?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    - Provisioner can get the Composition Data of nodes using the :ref:`Configuration Client Model <ble-mesh-terminology-foundation-models>` API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_config_client_set_state` with :code:`comp_data_get` in the parameter :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_cfg_client_get_state_t` set properly.\\n    - Users can refer to the following code to parse the Composition Data:\\n\\n    .. code:: c\\n\\n        #include <stdio.h>\\n        #include <string.h>\\n        #include <stdint.h>\\n\\n        //test date: 0C001A0001000800030000010501000000800100001003103F002A00\\n        //0C00 1A00 0100 0800 0300 0001 05 01 0000 0080 0100 0010 0310 3F002A00\\n\\n        // CID is 0x000C\\n        // PID is 0x001A\\n        // VID is 0x0001\\n        // CRPL is 0x0008\\n        // Features is 0x0003 – Relay and Friend features.\\n        // Loc is “front” – 0x0100\\n        // NumS is 5\\n        // NumV is 1\\n        // The Bluetooth SIG Models supported are: 0x0000, 0x8000, 0x0001, 0x1000, 0x1003\\n        // The Vendor Models supported are: Company Identifier 0x003F and Model Identifier 0x002A\\n\\n        typedef struct {\\n            int16_t cid;\\n            int16_t pid;\\n            int16_t vid;\\n            int16_t crpl;\\n            int16_t features;\\n            int16_t all_models;\\n            uint8_t sig_models;\\n            uint8_t vnd_models;\\n        } esp_ble_mesh_composition_head;\\n\\n        typedef struct {\\n            uint16_t model_id;\\n            uint16_t vendor_id;\\n        } tsModel;\\n\\n        typedef struct {\\n            // reserve space for up to 20 SIG models\\n            uint16_t SIG_models[20];\\n            uint8_t numSIGModels;\\n\\n            // reserve space for up to 4 vendor models\\n            tsModel Vendor_models[4];\\n            uint8_t numVendorModels;\\n        } esp_ble_mesh_composition_decode;\\n\\n        int decode_comp_data(esp_ble_mesh_composition_head *head, esp_ble_mesh_composition_decode *data, uint8_t *mystr, int size)\\n        {\\n            int pos_sig_base;\\n            int pos_vnd_base;\\n            int i;\\n\\n            memcpy(head, mystr, sizeof(*head));\\n\\n            if(size < sizeof(*head) + head->sig_models * 2 + head->vnd_models * 4) {\\n                return -1;\\n            }\\n\\n            pos_sig_base = sizeof(*head) - 1;\\n\\n            for(i = 1;

These configuration information can only be saved if they are configured by Configuration Client Model.\\n\\n1.17 How Does Provisioner Control Nodes by Grouping?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Generally there are two approaches to implement group control in ESP-BLE-MESH network, group address approach and virtual address approach. And supposing there are 10 devices, i.e., five devices with blue lights and five devices with red lights.\\n\\n    - Method 1: 5 blue lights can subscribe to a group address, 5 red lights subscribe to another one. By sending messages to different group addresses, Provisioner can realize group control.\\n\\n    - Method 2: 5 blue lights can subscribe to a virtual address, 5 red lights subscribe to another one. By sending messages to different virtual addresses, Provisioner can realize group control.\\n\\n1.18 How Does Provisioner Add Nodes to Multiple Subnets?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Provisioner can add multiple NetKeys to nodes during configuration, and nodes sharing the same NetKey belong to the same subnet. Provisioner can communicate with nodes on different subnets by using different NetKeys.\\n\\n1.19 How Does ProvIsioner Know If a Node in the Mesh Network Is Offline?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Node offline is usually defined as: the condition that the node cannot be properly communicated with other nodes in the mesh network due to power failure or some other reasons.\\n\\n    There is no connection between nodes and nodes in the ESP-BLE-MESH network. They communicate with each other through advertising channels.\\n\\n    An example is given here to show how to detect a node is offline by Provisioner.\\n\\n    - The node can periodically send heartbeat messages to Provisioner. And if Provisioner failed to receive heartbeat messages in a certain period, the node is considered to be offline.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The heartbeat message should be designed into a single package (less than 11 bytes), so the transmission and reception of it can be more efficient.\\n\\n1.20 What Operations Should Be Performed When Provisioner Removes Nodes from the Network?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Usually when Provisioner tries to remove node from the mesh network, the procedure includes three main steps:\\n\\n    - Firstly, Provisioner adds the node that need to be removed to the \"blacklist\".\\n\\n    - Secondly, Provisioner performs the :ref:`Key Refresh procedure <ble-mesh-terminology-network-management>`.\\n\\n    - Lastly, the node performs node reset procedure, and switches itself to an unprovisioned device.\\n\\n1.21 In the Key Refresh Procedure, How Does Provisioner Update the Netkey Owned by Nodes?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    - Provisioner updates the NetKey of nodes using the :ref:`Configuration Client Model <ble-mesh-terminology-foundation-models>` API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_config_client_set_state` with :code:`net_key_update` in the parameter :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_cfg_client_set_state_t` set properly.\\n\\n    - Provisioner updates the AppKey of nodes using the :ref:`Configuration Client Model <ble-mesh-terminology-foundation-models>` API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_config_client_set_state` with :code:`app_key_update` in the parameter :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_cfg_client_set_state_t` set properly.\\n\\n1.22 How Does Provisioner Manage Nodes in the Mesh Network?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    ESP-BLE-MESH implements several functions related to basic node management in the example, such as :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_store_node_info`. And ESP-BLE-MESH also provides the API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_provisioner_set_node_name` which can be used to set the node\\'s local name and the API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_provisioner_get_node_name` which can be used to get the node\\'s local name.\\n\\n1.23 What Does Provisioner Need When Trying to Control the Server Model of Nodes?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Provisioner must include corresponding client model before controlling the server model of nodes.\\n\\n    Provisioner shall add its local NetKey and AppKey.\\n\\n    - Provisioner add NetKey by calling the API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_provisioner_add_local_net_key`.\\n\\n    - Provisioner add AppKey by calling the API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_provisioner_add_local_app_key`.\\n\\n    Provisioner shall configure its own client model.\\n\\n    - Provisioner bind AppKey to its own client model by calling the API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_provisioner_bind_app_key_to_local_model`.\\n\\n1.24 How Does Provisioner Control the Server Model of Nodes?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    ESP-BLE-MESH supports all SIG-defined client models. Provisioner can use these client models to control the server models of nodes. And the client models are divided into 6 categories with each category has the corresponding functions.\\n\\n    - Configuration Client Model\\n\\n        - The API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_config_client_get_state` can be used to get the :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_cfg_client_get_state_t` values of Configuration Server Model.\\n        - The API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_config_client_set_state` can be used to set the :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_cfg_client_set_state_t` values of Configuration Server Model.\\n\\n    - Health Client Model\\n\\n        - The API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_health_client_get_state` can be used to get the :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_health_client_get_state_t` values of Health Server Model.\\n        - The API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_health_client_set_state` can be used to set the :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_health_client_set_state_t` values of Health Server Model.\\n\\n    - Generic Client Models\\n\\n        - The API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_generic_client_get_state` can be used to get the :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_generic_client_get_state_t` values of Generic Server Models.\\n        - The API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_generic_client_set_state` can be used to set the :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_generic_client_set_state_t` values of Generic Server Models.\\n\\n    - Lighting Client Models\\n\\n        - The API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_light_client_get_state` can be used to get the :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_light_client_get_state_t` values of Lighting Server Models.\\n        - The API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_light_client_set_state` can be used to set the :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_light_client_set_state_t` values of Lighting Server Models.\\n\\n    - Sensor Client Models\\n\\n        - The API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_sensor_client_get_state` can be used to get the :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_sensor_client_get_state_t` values of Sensor Server Model.\\n        - The API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_sensor_client_set_state` can be used to set the :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_sensor_client_set_state_t` values of Sensor Server Model.\\n\\n    - Time and Scenes Client Models\\n        - The API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_time_scene_client_get_state` can be used to get the :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_time_scene_client_get_state_t` values of Time and Scenes Server Models.\\n        - The API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_time_scene_client_set_state` can be used to set the :cpp:type:`esp_ble_mesh_time_scene_client_set_state_t` values of Time and Scenes Server Models.\\n\\n\\n.. _ble-mesh-faq-node-development:\\n\\n2. Node Development\\n-------------------\\n\\n2.1 What Kind of Models Are Included by Nodes?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    - In ESP-BLE-MESH, nodes are all composed of a series of models with each model implements some functions of the node.\\n\\n    - Model has two types, client model and server model. Client model can get and set the states of server model.\\n\\n    - Model can also be divided into SIG model and vendor model. All behaviors of SIG models are officially defined while behaviors of vendor models are defined by users.\\n\\n2.2 Is the Format of Messages Corresponding to Each Model Fixed?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    - Messages, which consist of opcode and payload, are divided by opcode.\\n\\n    - The type and the format of the messages corresponding to models are both fixed, which means the messages transmitted between models are fixed.\\n\\n2.3 Which Functions Can Be Used to Send Messages with the Models of Nodes?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    - For client models, users can use the API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_client_model_send_msg` to send messages.\\n\\n    - For server models, users can use the API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_server_model_send_msg` to send messages.\\n\\n    - For publication, users call the API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_model_publish` to publish messages.\\n\\n2.4 How to Achieve the Transmission of Messages Without Packet Loss?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Acknowledged message is needed if users want to transmit messages without packet loss. The default time to wait for corresponding response is set in :ref:`CONFIG_BLE_MESH_CLIENT_MSG_TIMEOUT`. If the sender waits for the response until the timer expires, the corresponding timeout event would be triggered.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Response timeout can be set in the API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_client_model_send_msg`. The default value (4 seconds) would be applied if the parameter :code:`msg_timeout` is set to **0**.\\n\\n2.5 How to Send Unacknowledged Messages?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    For client models, users can use the API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_client_model_send_msg` with the parameter :code:`need_rsp` set to :code:`false` to send unacknowledged messages.\\n\\n    For server models, the messages sent by using the API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_server_model_send_msg` are always unacknowledged messages.\\n\\n2.6 How to Add Subscription Address to Models?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Subscription address can be added through Configuration Client Model.\\n\\n2.7 What Is the Difference Between Messages Sent and Published by Models?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Messages sent by calling the API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_client_model_send_msg` or :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_server_model_send_msg` will be sent in the duration determined by the Network Transmit state.\\n\\n    Messages published by calling the API :cpp:func:`esp_ble_mesh_model_publish` will be published determined by the Model Publication state. And the publication of messages is generally periodic or with a fixed number of counts. The publication period and publication count are controlled by the Model Publication state, and can be configured through Configuration Client Model.\\n\\n2.8 How Many Bytes Can Be Carried When Sending Unsegmented Messages?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The total payload length (which can be set by users) of unsegmented message is 11 octets, so if the opcode of the message is 2 octets, then the message can carry 9-octets of valid information. For vendor messages, due to the 3-octets opcode, the remaining payload length is 8 octets.\\n\\n2.9 When Should the :ref:`Relay <ble-mesh-terminology-Features>` Feature of Nodes Be Enabled?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Users can enable the Relay feature of all nodes when nodes detected in the mesh network are sparse.\\n\\n    For dense mesh network, users can choose to just enable the Relay feature of several nodes.\\n\\n    And users can enable the Relay feature by default if the mesh network size is unknown.\\n\\n2.10 When Should the :ref:`Proxy <ble-mesh-terminology-Features>` Feature of Node Be Enabled?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    If the unprovisioned device is expected to be provisioned by a phone, then it should enable the Proxy feature since almost all the phones do not support sending ESP-BLE-MESH packets through advertising bearer currently. And after the unprovisioned device is provisioned successfully and becoming a Proxy node, it will communicate with the phone using GATT bearer and using advertising bearer to communicate with other nodes in the mesh network.\\n\\n2.11 How to Use the Proxy Filter?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The Proxy filter is used to reduce the number of Network PDUs exchanged between a Proxy Client (e.g., the phone) and a Proxy Server (e.g., the node). And with the Proxy filter, Proxy Client can explicitly request to receive only mesh messages with certain destination addresses from Proxy Server.\\n\\n2.12 When a Message Can Be Relayed by a Relay Node?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    If a message need to be relayed, the following conditions should be met.\\n\\n    - The message is in the mesh network.\\n\\n    - The message is not sent to the unicast address of the node.\\n\\n    - The value of TTL in the message is greater than 1.\\n\\n2.13 If a Message Is Segmented into Several Segments, Should the Other Relay Nodes Just Relay When One of These Segments Is Received or Wait Until the Message Is Received Completely?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Relay nodes will forward segments when one of them are received rather than keeping waiting until all the segments are received.\\n\\n2.14 What Is the Principle of Reducing Power Consumption Using :ref:`Low Power <ble-mesh-terminology-Features>` Feature?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    - When the radio is turned on for listening, the device is consuming energy. When low power feature of the node is enabled, it will turn off its radio in the most of the time.\\n\\n    - And cooperation is needed between low power node and friend node, thus low power node can receive messages at an appropriate or lower frequency without the need to keep listening.\\n\\n    - When there are some new messages for low power node, its friend node will store the messages for it. And low power node can poll friend nodes to see if there are new messages at a fixed interval.\\n\\n2.15 How to Continue the Communication on the Network After Powering-down and Powering-up Again?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Enable the configuration :code:`Store ESP-BLE-MESH Node configuration persistently` in `menuconfig`.\\n\\n2.16 How to Send out the Self-test Results of Nodes?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    It is recommended that nodes can publish its self-test results periodically through Health Server Model.\\n\\n2.17 How to Transmit Information Between Nodes?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    One possible application scenario for transmitting information between nodes is that spray nodes would be triggered once smoke alarm detected high smoke concentration. There are two approaches in implementation.\\n\\n    - Approach 1 is that spray node subscribes to a group address. When smoke alarm detects high smoke concentration, it will publish a message whose destination address is the group address which has been subscribed by spray node.\\n\\n    - Approach 2 is that Provisioner can configure the unicast address of spray node to the smoke alarm. When high smoke concentration is detected, smoke alarm can use send messages to the spray node with the spray node\\'s unicast address as the destination address.\\n\\n2.18 Is Gateway a Must for Nodes Communication?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    - Situation 1: nodes only communicate within the mesh network. In this situation, no gateway is need. ESP-BLE-MESH network is a flooded network, messages in the network have no fixed paths, and nodes can communicate with each other freely.\\n\\n    - Situation 2: if users want to control the nodes remotely, for example turn on some nodes before getting home, then a gateway is needed.\\n\\n2.19 When Will the IV Update Procedure Be Performed?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    IV Update procedure would be performed once sequence number of messages sent detected by the bottom layer of node reached a critical value.\\n\\n2.20 How to Perform IV Update Procedure?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Nodes can perform IV Update procedure with Secure Network Beacon.\\n\\n\\n.. _ble-mesh-faq-ble-mesh-and-wi-fi-coexistence:\\n\\n3.

But when it comes to a large number of unprovisioned devices (e.g., 100), provisioning them one by one will take huge amount of time. With fast provisioning, users can provision 100 unprovisioned devices in about 50 seconds.\\n\\n4.2 Why EspBleMesh App Would Wait for a Long Time During Fast Provisioning?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    After the App provisioned one Proxy node, it will disconnect from the App during fast provisioning, and reconnect with the App when all the nodes are provisioned.\\n\\n4.3 Why Is the Number of Node Addresses Displayed in the App Is More than That of Existing Node Addresses?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Each time after a fast provisioning process, and before starting a new one, the node addresses in the App should be cleared, otherwise the number of the node address will be incorrect.\\n\\n4.4 What Is the Usage of the **count** Value Which Was Input in EspBleMesh App?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The **count** value is provided to the Proxy node which is provisioned by the App so as to determine when to start Proxy advertising in advance.\\n\\n4.5 When will Configuration Client Model of the node running :example:`fast_prov_server <bluetooth/esp_ble_mesh/fast_provisioning/fast_prov_server>` example start to work?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    Configuration Client Model will start to work after the Temporary Provisioner functionality is enabled.\\n\\n4.6 Will the Temporary Provisioner Functionality Be Enabled All the Time?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    After the nodes receive messages used to turn on/off lights, all the nodes will disable its Temporary Provisioner functionality and become nodes.\\n\\n\\n.. _ble-mesh-faq-log-help:\\n\\n5.

Then the node will retransmit the message. When the retransmission count reaches the maximum number, which is 4 currently, then this warning will appear.\\n\\n5.2 What Is the Meaning of Warning  ``Duplicate found in Network Message Cache``?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    When the node receives a message, it will compare the message with the ones stored in the network cache.

Nodes (such as lighting devices, temperature control devices, manufacturing equipments, and electric doors) are devices that can send, receive, or relay messages in ESP-BLE-MESH network, and they can optionally support one or more subnets.\\n  * - Relay Node\\n    - A node that supports the Relay feature and has the Relay feature enabled is known as a Relay node.\\n    - Relay nodes can receive and resend ESP-BLE-MESH messages, so the messages can be transferred further. Users can decide whether or not to enable forwarding function of nodes according to nodes\\' status. Messages can be relayed for multiple times, and each relay is considered as a \"hop\". Messages can hop up to 126 times, which is enough for message transmission in a wide area.\\n  * - Proxy Node\\n    - A node that supports the Proxy feature and has the Proxy feature enabled is known as a Proxy node.\\n    - Proxy nodes receive messages from one bearer (it generally includes advertising bearer and GATT bearer) and resend it from another one. The purpose is to connect communication equipments that only support GATT bearer to ESP-BLE-MESH network. Generally, mobile apps need a Proxy node to access Mesh network. Without Proxy nodes, mobile apps cannot communicate with members in Mesh network.\\n  * - Friend Node\\n    - A node that supports the Friend feature, has the Friend feature enabled, and has a friendship with a node that supports the Low Power feature is known as a Friend node.\\n    - Friend node, like the backup of Low Power node (LPN), can store messages that are sent to Low Power node and security updates; the stored information will be transferred to Low Power node when Low Power node needs it. Low Power node must establish \"friendship\" with another node that supports the Friend Feature to reduce duty cycle of its receiver, thus power consumption of Low Power node can be reduced. Low Power node needs to find a Friend node to establish a friendship with it. The process involved is called \"friendship establishment\". Cooperation between Low Power node and Friend nodes enables Low Power node to schedule the use of the radio, thus Low Power node can receive messages at an appropriate or lower frequency without the need of keeping listening. Low Power node will poll Friend node to see if there is new message.\\n  * - Low Power Node\\n    - A node that supports the Low Power feature and has a friendship with a node that supports the Friend feature is known as a Low Power node.\\n    - By polling, Low Power node gets information from Friend node, such as messages, security updates, and etc.\\n  * -  Provisioner\\n    - A node that is capable of adding a device to a mesh network.\\n    - The device that can provision unprovisioned devices is called a Provisioner. This process usually needs to be implemented through an app that is typically provided by the product manufacturer and can be used on a gateway, a smartphone, tablet or other carriers.\\n\\n\\n.. _ble-mesh-terminology-composition:\\n\\n.. list-table:: Table 2 ESP-BLE-MESH Terminology - Composition\\n  :widths: 10 40 60\\n  :header-rows: 1\\n\\n  * - Term\\n    - Official Definition\\n    - Detailed Explanation\\n  * - State\\n    - A value representing a condition of an element that is exposed by an element of a node.\\n    - Each node in a ESP-BLE-MESH network has an independent set of state values that indicate certain states of the device, like brightness, and color of lighting device. Change of state value will lead to change of the physical state of devices. For example, changing the on/off state of a device is actually turning on/off the device.\\n  * - Model\\n    - A model defines the basic functionality of a node.\\n    - A node may contain multiple models, and each model defines basic functionalities of nodes, like the states needed by the nodes, the messages controlling the states, and actions resulted from messages handling. The function implementation of the nodes is based on models, which can be divided into SIG Model and Vendor Model, with the former defined by SIG and latter defined by users.\\n  * - Element\\n    - An addressable entity within a device.\\n    - A node can contain one or more elements, with each having a unicast address and one or more models, and the models contained by the same element must not be the same.\\n  * - Composition Data State\\n    - The Composition Data state contains information about a node, the elements it includes, and the supported models.\\n    - By reading the value of the Composition Data state, users can know basic information of the node, such as the number of elements, and the models in each element. Provisioner gets this message to further provision the device, such as configuring subscription address and publishing address of nodes.\\n\\n\\n.. _ble-mesh-terminology-features:\\n\\n.. list-table:: Table 3 ESP-BLE-MESH Terminology - Features\\n  :widths: 10 40 60\\n  :header-rows: 1\\n\\n  * - Term\\n    - Official Definition\\n    - Detailed Explanation\\n  * - Low Power Feature\\n    - The ability to operate within a mesh network at significantly reduced receiver duty cycles only in conjunction with a node supporting the Friend feature.\\n    - Low Power feature reduces power consumption of nodes. When a Low Power node is searching for a Friend node, and there are multiple Friend nodes nearby, it selects the most suitable Friend node through algorithm.\\n  * - Friend Feature\\n    - The ability to help a node supporting the Low Power feature to operate by storing messages destined for those nodes.\\n    - By enabling friend feature, the node can help to store information for Low Power node. The nodes enabled with friend feature may cause more power and memory consumption.\\n  * - Relay Feature\\n    - The ability to receive and retransmit mesh messages over the advertising bearer to enable larger networks.\\n    - The relay feature enables ESP-BLE-MESH messages to hop among nodes for multiple times, and the transmission distance can exceed the range of direct radio transmission between two nodes, thereby covering the entire network. When a node is enabled with the relay feature to relay messages, it only relays the messages of its own subnet, and does not relay the messages of other subnets. The data integrity will not be considered when the node enabled with relay feature relays segmented messages. The node would relay every segmented message once it receives one rather than waiting for the complete message.\\n  * - Proxy Feature\\n    - The ability to receive and retransmit mesh messages between GATT and advertising bearers.\\n    - The purpose of the proxy feature is to allow nodes without an advertising bearer to access the ESP-BLE-MESH network. The proxy feature is typically used in nodes that need to connect to mobile apps.\\n\\n\\n.. _ble-mesh-terminology-provisioning:\\n\\n.. list-table:: Table 4 ESP-BLE-MESH Terminology - Provisioning\\n  :widths: 10 40 60\\n  :header-rows: 1\\n\\n  * - Term\\n    - Official Definition\\n    - Detailed Explanation\\n  * - PB-ADV\\n    - PB-ADV is a provisioning bearer used to provision a device using Generic Provisioning PDUs over the advertising channels.\\n    - PB-ADV transfers packets generated during the provisioning process over the advertising channels. This way can only be used for provisioning when provisioner and unprovisioned device both support PB-ADV.\\n  * - PB-GATT\\n    - PB-GATT is a provisioning bearer used to provision a device using Proxy PDUs to encapsulate Provisioning PDUs within the Mesh Provisioning Service.\\n    - PB-GATT uses connection channels to transfer packets generated during the provisioning process. If an unprovisioned device wants to be provisioned through this method, it needs to implement the related Mesh Provisioning Service. Unprovisioned devices which don\\'t implement such service cannot be provisioned into mesh network through PB-GATT bearer.\\n  * - PB-Remote\\n    - The PB-Remote provisioning bearer uses the existing mesh network to provision an unprovisioned device that is not within immediate radio range of the Provisioner.\\n    - PB-Remote uses the PB-ADV bearer or the PB-GATT bearer for the last hop to the unprovisioned device.\\n  * - Provisioning\\n    - Provisioning is a process of adding an unprovisioned device to a mesh network, managed by a Provisioner.\\n    - The process of provisioning turns the \"unprovisioned device\" into a \"node\", making it a member of the ESP-BLE-MESH network.\\n  * - Authentication Method\\n    - Authentication is a step during the provisioning of nodes.\\n    - There are four authentication methods for unprovisioned devices: Output OOB, Input OOB, Static OOB, and No OOB.\\n  * - Input OOB\\n    - Input Out-of-Band\\n    - For example, a Provisioner generates and displays a random number, and then prompts users to take appropriate actions to input the random number into the unprovisioned device. Taking lighting switch as an example, users can press the button for several times in a certain period of time to input the random number displayed on the Provisioner. Authentication method of the Input OOB is similar to that of Output OOB, but the role of the device is reversed.\\n  * - Output OOB\\n    - Output Out-of-Band\\n    - For example, an unprovisioned device will choose a random number and output the number in a way that is compatible with its functionality. If the unprovisioned device is a bulb, it can flash a specified number of times. If the unprovisioned device has an LCD screen, the random number can display as a multi-digit value. Users who start provisioning should input the observed number to authenticate the unprovisioned device.\\n  * - Static OOB\\n    - Static Out-of-Band\\n    - Authentication method of Static OOB: use Static OOB information. Use 0 as Static OOB information if No OOB information is needed. Use Static OOB information to authenticate devices which are going through provisioning if OOB information is needed.\\n  * - No OOB\\n    - No Out-of-Band\\n    - Authentication method of No OOB: Set the value of the Static OOB field to 0. Using this way is like not authenticating the unprovisioned devices.\\n  * - Certificate-based Provisioning\\n    - Certificate-based Out-of-Band\\n    - The certificate-based provisioning feature makes use of Public Key Infrastructure to authenticate unprovisioned device\\'s public key and UUID information.\\n\\n\\n.. _ble-mesh-terminology-address:\\n\\n.. list-table:: Table 5 ESP-BLE-MESH Terminology - Address\\n  :widths: 10 40 60\\n  :header-rows: 1\\n\\n  * - Term\\n    - Official Definition\\n    - Detailed Explanation\\n  * - Unassigned Address\\n    - This is a special address type, with a value of 0x0000. Its use indicates that an Element has not yet been configured or had a Unicast Address assigned to it.\\n    - The addresses owned by elements which has not been configured yet or no address has been allocated are unassigned addresses. These elements will not be used for messages transfer because they have no fixed address. Unassigned address is recommended to set as the value of the address before setting the address of user code.\\n  * - Unicast Address\\n    - A unicast address is a unique address allocated to each element.\\n    - During provisioning, the Provisioner will assign a unicast address to each element of node within the life cycle of the nodes in the network. A unicast address may appear in the source/destination address field of a message. Messages sent to a unicast address can only be processed by the element that owns the unicast address.\\n  * - Virtual Address\\n    - A virtual address represents a set of destination addresses. Each virtual address logically represents a Label UUID, which is a 128-bit value that does not have to be managed centrally.\\n    - Associated with specific UUID labels, a virtual address may serve as the publishing or subscription address of the model. A UUID label is a 128-bit value associated with elements of one or more nodes. For virtual addresses, the 15th and 14th bits are set to 1 and 0 respectively; bits from 13th to 0 are set to hash values (providing 16384 hash values). The hash is a derivation of the Label UUID. To use subscribing elements to check the full 128-bit UUID is very inefficient while hash values provide a more efficient way to determine which elements that which messages are finally sent to.\\n  * - Group Address\\n    - A group address is an address that is programmed into zero or more elements\\n    - Group address is another kind of multicast address in the ESP-BLE-MESH network, which is usually used to group nodes. A message sent to the all-proxies address shall be processed by the primary element of all nodes that have the proxy functionality enabled. A message sent to the all-friends address shall be processed by the primary element of all nodes that have the friend functionality enabled. A message sent to the all-relays address shall be processed by the primary element of all nodes that have the relay functionality enabled. A message sent to the all-nodes address shall be processed by the primary element of all nodes.\\n\\n\\n.. _ble-mesh-terminology-security:\\n\\n.. list-table:: Table 6 ESP-BLE-MESH Terminology - Security\\n  :widths: 10 40 60\\n  :header-rows: 1\\n\\n  * - Term\\n    - Official Definition\\n    - Detailed Explanation\\n  * - Device Key (DevKey)\\n    - There is also a device key, which is a special application key that is unique to each node, is known only to the node and a Configuration Client, and is used to secure communications between the node and a Configuration Client.\\n    - The device key enables you to provision the devices, configure the nodes. The device key is used to encrypt Configuration Messages, i.e., the message transferred between the Provisioner and the node when the device is configured.\\n  * - Application Key (AppKey)\\n    - Application keys are used to secure communications at the upper transport layer.\\n    - Application key is used for decryption of application data before delivering application data to application layer and encryption of them during the delivery of application layer. Some nodes in the network have a specific purpose and can restrict access to potentially sensitive data based on the needs of the application. With specific application keys, these nodes are associated with specific applications. Generally speaking, the fields using different application keys include security (access control of buildings, machine rooms and CEO offices), lighting (plant, exterior building and sidewalks) and HVAC systems. Application keys are bound to Network keys. This means application keys are only used in a context of a Network key they are bound to. An application key shall only be bound to a single Network key.\\n  * - Flooding Security Material\\n    - The flooding security material is derived from the network key (NetKey) and can be used by other nodes in the same network. Messages encrypted with flooding security material can be decoded by any node in the same network.\\n    - The corresponding friendship messages encrypted with the friendship security material: 1. Friend Poll, 2. Friend Update, 3. Friend Subscription List, add/delete/confirm, 4. The Stored Messages\" sent by friend nodes to Low Power node. The corresponding friendship messages encrypted with the flooding security material: 1. Friend Clear, 2. Friend Clear Confirm. Based on the setup of the applications, the messages sent from the Low Power node to the friend nodes will be encrypted with the friendship security material or flooding security material, with the former being used by the messages transmitted between Low Power node and friend nodes and the latter being used by other network messages.\\n  * - Directed Security Material\\n    - The directed security material is derived from the network key (NetKey) and can be used by other nodes in the directed forwarding path.\\n    - The messages that need to be forwarded through the directed forwarding path need to be encrypted with the directed security material. Messages encrypted with directed security material can be decoded by any node in the same directed forwarding path.\\n\\n.. _ble-mesh-terminology-message:\\n\\n.. list-table:: Table 7 ESP-BLE-MESH Terminology - Message\\n  :widths: 10 40 60\\n  :header-rows: 1\\n\\n  * - Term\\n    - Official Definition\\n    - Detailed Explanation\\n  * - Reassembly/Segmentation\\n    - Segmentation and reassembly (SAR) is a method of communication network, which is divided into small units before transmitting packets and reassembled in a proper order at the communication receiving end.\\n    - The lower transport layer will automatically segment the message whose size is too big. The receiving end will return a response message, and the transmitting end will send the data packet again that the receiving end does not receive according to the response message. This is automatically completed by the lower transport layer. Unsegmented messages have at most 15 bytes, of which 4 bytes are transMIC, so the remaining is 11 bytes; in the case of segmentation, there are 12 valid bytes in the first several packets, and 8 in the last one. Special case: A shorter packet requires mandatory segmentation from lower transport layer, in which case the valid byte is 8 bytes.\\n  * - Unacknowledged/Acknowledged\\n    - There are two types of messages: Unacknowledged or Acknowledged\\n    - Based on the whether or not the receiving end needs to send the response message, the messages sent are divided into two kinds. The sending end should set the maximum number of retransmission.\\n\\n\\n.. _ble-mesh-terminology-foundation-models:\\n\\n.. list-table:: Table 8 ESP-BLE-MESH Terminology - Foundation Models\\n  :widths: 10 40 60\\n  :header-rows: 1\\n\\n  * - Term\\n    - Official Definition\\n    - Detailed Explanation\\n  * - Configuration Server Model\\n    - This model is used to represent a mesh network configuration of a device.\\n    - The node must contain the Configuration Server Model, which is responsible for maintaining configuration-related states. The states that Configuration Server Model maintains include: NetKey List, AppKey List, Model to AppKey List, Node Identity, Key Refresh Phase, Heartbeat Publish, Heartbeat Subscription, Network Transmit, Relay Retransmit etc.\\n  * - Configuration Client Model\\n    - The model is used to represent an element that can control and monitor the configuration of a node.\\n    - The Configuration Client Model uses messages to control the state maintained by the Configuration Server Model.

Key Refresh Procedure is used when the security of one or more network keys and/or one or more application keys is threatened or potentially threatened. Keys are usually updated after some nodes in the network are removed.\\n  * - IV (Initialization Vector) Update Procedure\\n    - A node can also use an IV Update procedure to signal to peer nodes that it is updating the IV Index.\\n    - The IV Update procedure is used to update the value of ESP-BLE-MESH network\\'s IV Index. This value is related to the random number required for message encryption. To ensure that the value of the random number is not repeated, this value is periodically incremented. IV Index is a 32-bit value and a shared network resource. For example, all nodes in a mesh network share the same IV Index value. Starting from 0x00000000, the IV Index increments during the IV Update procedure and maintained by a specific process, ensuring the IV Index shared in the mesh network is the same. This can be done when the node believes that it has the risk of exhausting its sequence number, or when it determines that another node is nearly exhausting its sequence number. Note: The update time must not be less than 96 hours. It can be triggered when a secure network beacon is received, or when the node determines that its sequence number is greater than a certain value.\\n\\nFor more terms, please see: `ESP-BLE-MESH Glossary of Terms <https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/recent-enhancements/mesh/mesh-glossary/>`_.\\n',\n",

For ESP-IDF applications, `IDF Eclipse plugin <https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin>`_ provides two ways of debugging:\\n\\n1. `ESP-IDF GDB OpenOCD Debugging <https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/docs/OpenOCD%20Debugging.md#esp-idf-gdb-openocd-debugging>`_\\n2. GDB Hardware Debugging\\n\\nBy default, Eclipse supports OpenOCD Debugging via the GDB Hardware Debugging plugin, which requires starting the OpenOCD server from the command line and configuring the GDB client from Eclipse to start with the debugging. This approach can be time-consuming and error-prone.\\n\\nTo make the debugging process easier, the IDF Eclipse plugin has a customized ESP-IDF GDB OpenOCD Debugging functionality. This functionality supports configuring the OpenOCD server and GDB client from within Eclipse. All the required configuration parameters will be pre-filled by the plugin, and you can start debugging with just a click of a button.\\n\\nTherefore, it is recommended to use the `ESP-IDF GDB OpenOCD Debugging <https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/docs/OpenOCD%20Debugging.md#esp-idf-gdb-openocd-debugging>`_ via the IDF Eclipse plugin.\\n\\n**GDB Hardware Debugging**\\n\\n.. note::\\n    This approach is recommended only if you are unable to debug using `ESP-IDF GDB OpenOCD Debugging <https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/docs/OpenOCD%20Debugging.md#esp-idf-gdb-openocd-debugging>`_ for some reason.\\n\\nTo install the ``GDB Hardware Debugging`` plugin, open Eclipse and select ``Help`` > ``Install`` New Software.\\n\\nAfter installation is complete, follow these steps to configure the debugging session. Please note that some configuration parameters are generic, while others are project-specific. This will be shown below by configuring debugging for \"blink\" example project. If not done already, add this project to Eclipse workspace following `Eclipse Plugin <https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/README.md>`_.  The source of :example:`get-started/blink` application is available in :idf:`examples` directory of ESP-IDF repository.\\n\\n1.  In Eclipse, go to ``Run`` > ``Debug Configuration``. A new window will open. In the left pane of the window, double-click ``GDB Hardware Debugging`` (or select ``GDB Hardware Debugging`` and press the ``New`` button) to create a new configuration.\\n\\n2.  In a form that will show up on the right, enter the ``Name:`` of this configuration, e.g., \"Blink checking\".\\n\\n3.  On the ``Main`` tab below, under ``Project:``, press the ``Browse`` button and select the ``blink`` project.\\n\\n4.  In the next line under ``C/C++ Application:``, press the ``Browse`` button and select the ``blink.elf`` file. If ``blink.elf`` is not there, it is likely that this project has not been built yet. Refer to the `Eclipse Plugin <https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/README.md>`_ for instructions.\\n\\n5.  Finally, under ``Build (if required) before launching`` click ``Disable auto build``.\\n\\n    A sample window with settings entered in points 1 - 5 is shown below.\\n\\n    .. figure:: ../../../_static/hw-debugging-main-tab.jpg\\n        :align: center\\n        :alt: Configuration of GDB Hardware Debugging - Main tab\\n        :figclass: align-center\\n\\n        Configuration of GDB Hardware Debugging - Main tab\\n\\n6.  Click the ``Debugger`` tab. In field ``GDB Command``, enter ``{IDF_TARGET_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX}-gdb`` to invoke the debugger.\\n\\n7.  Change the default configuration of the ``Remote host`` by entering ``3333`` under the ``Port number``.\\n\\n    Configuration entered in points 6 and 7 is shown on the following picture.\\n\\n    .. figure:: ../../../_static/hw-debugging-debugger-tab.jpg\\n        :align: center\\n        :alt: Configuration of GDB Hardware Debugging - Debugger tab\\n        :figclass: align-center\\n\\n        Configuration of GDB Hardware Debugging - Debugger tab\\n\\n8.  The last tab that requires changing the default configuration is ``Startup``. Under ``Initialization Commands`` uncheck ``Reset and Delay (seconds)`` and ``Halt``. Then, in the entry field below, enter the following lines:\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n        mon reset halt\\n        maintenance flush register-cache\\n        set remote hardware-watchpoint-limit 2\\n\\n    .. note::\\n        To automatically update the image in the flash before starting a new debug session, add the following command lines to the beginning of the ``Initialization Commands`` textbox::\\n\\n            mon reset halt\\n            mon program_esp ${workspace_loc:blink/build/blink.bin} 0x10000 verify\\n\\n    For description of ``program_esp`` command, see :ref:`jtag-upload-app-debug`.\\n\\n9.  Uncheck the ``Load image`` option under ``Load Image and Symbols``.\\n\\n10. Further down on the same tab, establish an initial breakpoint to halt CPUs after they are reset by debugger. The plugin will set this breakpoint at the beginning of the function entered under ``Set break point at:``. Checkout this option and enter ``app_main`` in provided field.\\n\\n11. Checkout ``Resume`` option. This will make the program to resume after ``mon reset halt`` is invoked per point 8. The program will then stop at breakpoint inserted at ``app_main``.\\n\\n    Configuration described in points 8 - 11 is shown below.\\n\\n    .. figure:: ../../../_static/hw-debugging-startup-tab.jpg\\n        :align: center\\n        :alt: Configuration of GDB Hardware Debugging - Startup tab\\n        :figclass: align-center\\n\\n        Configuration of GDB Hardware Debugging - Startup tab\\n\\n    If the ``Startup`` sequence looks convoluted and respective ``Initialization Commands`` are unclear, check :ref:`jtag-debugging-tip-debugger-startup-commands` for additional explanation.\\n\\n12. If you have completed the :ref:`jtag-debugging-configuring-target` steps described above, so the target is running and ready to talk to debugger, go right to debugging by pressing ``Debug`` button. Otherwise press ``Apply`` to save changes, go back to :ref:`jtag-debugging-configuring-target` and return here to start debugging.\\n\\nOnce all configuration steps 1-12 are satisfied, the new Eclipse perspective called \"Debug\" will open, as shown in the example picture below.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/debug-perspective.jpg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Debug Perspective in Eclipse\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Debug Perspective in Eclipse\\n\\nIf you are not quite sure how to use GDB, check :ref:`jtag-debugging-examples-eclipse` example debugging session in section :ref:`jtag-debugging-examples`.\\n\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-using-debugger-command-line:\\n\\nCommand Line\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n1.  Begin by completing the steps described under :ref:`jtag-debugging-configuring-target`. This is prerequisite to start a debugging session.\\n\\n.. highlight:: bash\\n\\n2.  Open a new terminal session and go to the directory that contains the project for debugging, e.g.,\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n        cd ~/esp/blink\\n\\n.. highlight:: none\\n\\n3.  When launching a debugger, you will need to provide a couple of configuration parameters and commands. Instead of entering them one by one in the command line, create a configuration file and name it ``gdbinit``:\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n        target remote :3333\\n        set remote hardware-watchpoint-limit 2\\n        mon reset halt\\n        maintenance flush register-cache\\n        thb app_main\\n        c\\n\\n    Save this file in the current directory.\\n\\n    For more details on what is inside ``gdbinit`` file, see :ref:`jtag-debugging-tip-debugger-startup-commands`\\n\\n.. highlight:: bash\\n\\n4.  Now you are ready to launch GDB. Type the following in terminal:\\n\\n    ::\\n\\n        {IDF_TARGET_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX}-gdb -x gdbinit build/blink.elf\\n\\n.. highlight:: none\\n\\n5.

These commands are supported:\\n\\n1.  ``idf.py openocd``\\n\\n    Runs OpenOCD in a console with configuration defined in the environment or via command line. It uses default script directory defined as ``OPENOCD_SCRIPTS`` environmental variable, which is automatically added from an Export script (``export.sh`` or ``export.bat``).\\n    It is possible to override the script location using command line argument ``--openocd-scripts``.\\n\\n    .. include:: {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}.inc\\n        :start-after: idf-py-openocd-default-cfg\\n        :end-before: ---\\n\\n    To configure the JTAG configuration for the current board, please use the environmental variable ``OPENOCD_COMMANDS`` or ``--openocd-commands`` command line argument. If none of the above is defined, OpenOCD is started with |idf-py-def-cfg| board definition.\\n\\n\\n2.  ``idf.py gdb``\\n\\n    Starts the GDB the same way as the :ref:`jtag-debugging-using-debugger-command-line`, but generates the initial GDB scripts referring to the current project elf file.\\n\\n\\n3.  ``idf.py gdbtui``\\n\\n    The same as `2`, but starts the gdb with ``tui`` argument, allowing for a simple source code view.\\n\\n\\n4.  ``idf.py gdbgui``\\n\\n    Starts `gdbgui <https://www.gdbgui.com>`_ debugger frontend enabling out-of-the-box debugging in a browser window. To enable this option, run the install script with the \"--enable-gdbgui\" argument, e.g., ``install.sh --enable-gdbgui``.\\n\\n\\n    You can combine these debugging actions on a single command line, allowing for convenient setup of blocking and non-blocking actions in one step. ``idf.py`` implements a simple logic to move the background actions (such as openocd) to the beginning and the interactive ones (such as gdb, monitor) to the end of the action list.\\n\\n    An example of a very useful combination is::\\n\\n        idf.py openocd gdbgui monitor\\n\\n\\n    The above command runs OpenOCD in the background, starts `gdbgui <https://www.gdbgui.com>`_ to open a browser window with active debugger frontend and opens a serial monitor in the active console.\\n',\n",

A better (and in many cases quicker) way to debug such problems is by using a debugger, connected to the processors over a debug port.\\n\\nEspressif has ported OpenOCD to support the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} processor and the multi-core FreeRTOS  (which is the foundation of most {IDF_TARGET_NAME} apps). Additionally, some extra tools have been written to provide extra features that OpenOCD does not support natively.\\n\\nThis document provides a guide to installing OpenOCD for {IDF_TARGET_NAME} and debugging using GDB under Linux, Windows and macOS. Except for OS specific installation procedures, the s/w user interface and use procedures are the same across all supported operating systems.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Screenshots presented in this document have been made for Eclipse Neon 3 running on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. There may be some small differences in what a particular user interface looks like, depending on whether you are using Windows, macOS or Linux and/or a different release of Eclipse.\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-how-it-works:\\n\\nHow it Works?\\n-------------\\n\\nThe key software and hardware components that perform debugging of {IDF_TARGET_NAME} with OpenOCD over JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) interface is presented in the diagram below under the \"Debugging With JTAG\" label. These components include {IDF_TARGET_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX}-gdb debugger, OpenOCD on chip debugger, and the JTAG adapter connected to {IDF_TARGET_NAME} target.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/jtag-debugging-overview.jpg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: JTAG debugging - overview diagram\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    JTAG debugging - overview diagram\\n\\nLikewise, the \"Application Loading and Monitoring\" label indicates the key software and hardware components that allow an application to be compiled, built, and flashed to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, as well as to provide means to monitor diagnostic messages from {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.\\n\\n\"Debugging With JTAG\" and \"Application Loading and Monitoring\" is integrated under the `Eclipse <https://www.eclipse.org/>`_ IDE in order to provide a quick and easy transition between writing/compiling/loading/debugging code. The Eclipse IDE (and the integrated debugging software) is available for Windows, Linux and macOS platforms. Depending on user preferences, both the debugger and ``idf.py build`` can also be used directly from terminal/command line, instead of Eclipse.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32s2\\n\\n    If the |devkit-name-with-link| is used, then connection from PC to {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is done effectively with a single USB cable. This is made possible by the FT2232H chip, which provides two USB channels, one for JTAG and the other for UART connection.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_USB_SERIAL_JTAG_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    The connection from PC to {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is done effectively with a single USB cable. This is made possible by the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip itself, which provides two USB channels, one for JTAG and the other for the USB terminal connection. The USB cable should be connected to the D+/D- USB pins of {IDF_TARGET_NAME} and not to the serial RxD/TxD through a USB-to-UART chip. The proper connection is explained later in subsection :ref:`jtag-debugging-configuring-target`.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c3\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Debugging through the USB interface implemented in {IDF_TARGET_NAME} requires to have a chip with revision 0.3 or newer. Please use other debugging options (e.g., with ESP-Prog) for chip revisions 0.1 and 0.2. The easiest way to determine the chip revision is to look for the ``boot: chip revision: v0.3`` message at the beginning of the boot log. See `SoC errata <https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-c3_errata_en.pdf>`_ for more details.\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-selecting-jtag-adapter:\\n\\nSelecting JTAG Adapter\\n----------------------\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32s2\\n\\n    The quickest and most convenient way to start with JTAG debugging is by using |devkit-name-with-link|. Each version of this development board has JTAG interface already built in. No need for an external JTAG adapter and extra wiring/cable to connect JTAG to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. |devkit-name| is using FT2232H JTAG interface operating at 20 MHz clock speed, which is difficult to achieve with an external adapter.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_USB_SERIAL_JTAG_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    The quickest and most convenient way to start with JTAG debugging is through a USB cable connected to the D+/D- USB pins of {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. No need for an external JTAG adapter and extra wiring/cable to connect JTAG to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.\\n\\nIf you decide to use separate JTAG adapter, look for one that is compatible with both the voltage levels on the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} as well as with the OpenOCD software. The JTAG port on the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is an industry-standard JTAG port which lacks (and does not need) the TRST pin. The JTAG I/O pins all are powered from the VDD_3P3_RTC pin (which normally would be powered by a 3.3 V rail) so the JTAG adapter needs to be able to work with JTAG pins in that voltage range.\\n\\nOn the software side, OpenOCD supports a fair amount of JTAG adapters. See https://openocd.org/doc/html/Debug-Adapter-Hardware.html for an (unfortunately slightly incomplete) list of the adapters OpenOCD works with. This page lists SWD-compatible adapters as well; take note that the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} does not support SWD. JTAG adapters that are hardcoded to a specific product line, e.g., ST-LINK debugging adapters for STM32 families, will not work.\\n\\nThe minimal signalling to get a working JTAG connection are TDI, TDO, TCK, TMS and GND. Some JTAG debuggers also need a connection from the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} power line to a line called e.g., Vtar to set the working voltage. SRST can optionally be connected to the CH_PD of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, although for now, support in OpenOCD for that line is pretty minimal.\\n\\n`ESP-Prog <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/espressif-esp-iot-solution/en/latest/hw-reference/ESP-Prog_guide.html>`_ is an example for using an external board for debugging by connecting it to the JTAG pins of {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-setup-openocd:\\n\\nSetup of OpenOCD\\n----------------\\n\\n.. highlight:: bash\\n\\nIf you have already set up ESP-IDF with CMake build system according to the :doc:`Getting Started Guide <../../get-started/index>`, then OpenOCD is already installed. After :ref:`setting up the environment <get-started-set-up-env>` in your terminal, you should be able to run OpenOCD. Check this by executing the following command::\\n\\n    openocd --version\\n\\n.. highlight:: none\\n\\nThe output should be as follows (although the version may be more recent than listed here)::\\n\\n    Open On-Chip Debugger  v0.10.0-esp32-20190708 (2019-07-08-11:04)\\n    Licensed under GNU GPL v2\\n    For bug reports, read\\n        https://openocd.org/doc/doxygen/bugs.html\\n\\nYou may also verify that OpenOCD knows where its configuration scripts are located by printing the value of ``OPENOCD_SCRIPTS`` environment variable, by typing ``echo $OPENOCD_SCRIPTS`` (for Linux and macOS) or ``echo %OPENOCD_SCRIPTS%`` (for Windows). If a valid path is printed, then OpenOCD is set up correctly.\\n\\nIf any of these steps do not work, please go back to the :ref:`setting up the tools <get-started-set-up-tools>` section (for Linux and macOS) or :ref:`ESP-IDF Tools Installer <get-started-windows-tools-installer>` (for Windows) section of the Getting Started Guide.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    It is also possible to build OpenOCD from source. Please refer to :ref:`jtag-debugging-building-openocd` section for details.\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-configuring-target:\\n\\nConfiguring {IDF_TARGET_NAME} Target\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nOnce OpenOCD is installed, you can proceed to configuring the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} target (i.e {IDF_TARGET_NAME} board with JTAG interface). Configuring the target is split into the following three steps:\\n\\n* :ref:`jtag-debugging-configure-and-connect-JTAG-interface`\\n* :ref:`jtag-debugging-run-openocd`\\n* :ref:`jtag-upload-app-debug`\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-configure-and-connect-JTAG-interface:\\n\\nConfigure and Connect JTAG Interface\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThis step depends on the JTAG and {IDF_TARGET_NAME} board you are using (see the two cases described below).\\n\\n.. toctree::\\n    :maxdepth: 1\\n\\n    :esp32: configure-ft2232h-jtag\\n    :esp32s2: configure-ft2232h-jtag\\n    :SOC_USB_SERIAL_JTAG_SUPPORTED: configure-builtin-jtag\\n    configure-other-jtag\\n\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-run-openocd:\\n\\nRun OpenOCD\\n^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nOnce target is configured and connected to computer, you are ready to launch OpenOCD.\\n\\n.. highlight:: bash\\n\\nOpen a terminal and set it up for using the ESP-IDF as described in the :ref:`setting up the environment <get-started-set-up-env>` section of the Getting Started Guide. Then run OpenOCD (this command works on Windows, Linux, and macOS):\\n\\n.. include:: {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}.inc\\n   :start-after: run-openocd\\n   :end-before: ---\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_FTDI_CONFIG:default=\"Not Updated!\", esp32s3=\"board/esp32s3-ftdi.cfg\", esp32c3=\"board/esp32c3-ftdi.cfg\", esp32c6=\"board/esp32c6-ftdi.cfg\", esp32h2=\"board/esp32h2-ftdi.cfg\"}\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The files provided after ``-f`` above are specific for |run-openocd-device-name|. You may need to provide different files depending on the hardware that is used. For guidance see :ref:`jtag-debugging-tip-openocd-configure-target`.\\n\\n    .. only:: SOC_USB_SERIAL_JTAG_SUPPORTED\\n\\n        For example, ``{IDF_TARGET_FTDI_CONFIG}`` can be used for a custom board with an FT2232H or FT232H chip used for JTAG connection, or with ESP-Prog.\\n\\n.. highlight:: none\\n\\nYou should now see similar output (this log is for |run-openocd-device-name|):\\n\\n.. include:: {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}.inc\\n   :start-after: run-openocd-output\\n   :end-before: ---\\n\\n* If there is an error indicating permission problems, please see section on \"Permissions delegation\" in the OpenOCD README file located in the ``~/esp/openocd-esp32`` directory.\\n* In case there is an error in finding the configuration files, e.g., |run-openocd-cfg-file-err|, check if the ``OPENOCD_SCRIPTS`` environment variable is set correctly. This variable is used by OpenOCD to look for the files specified after the ``-f`` option. See :ref:`jtag-debugging-setup-openocd` section for details. Also check if the file is indeed under the provided path.\\n* If you see JTAG errors (e.g., ``...all ones`` or ``...all zeroes``), please check your JTAG connections, whether other signals are connected to JTAG besides {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\'s pins, and see if everything is powered on correctly.\\n\\n.. _jtag-upload-app-debug:\\n\\nUpload Application for Debugging\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBuild and upload your application to {IDF_TARGET_NAME} as usual, see :ref:`get-started-build`.\\n\\nAnother option is to write application image to flash using OpenOCD via JTAG with commands like this:\\n\\n.. include:: {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}.inc\\n   :start-after: run-openocd-upload\\n   :end-before: ---\\n\\nOpenOCD flashing command ``program_esp`` has the following format:\\n\\n``program_esp <image_file> <offset> [verify] [reset] [exit] [compress] [encrypt]``\\n\\n - ``image_file`` - Path to program image file.\\n - ``offset`` - Offset in flash bank to write image.\\n - ``verify`` - Optional. Verify flash contents after writing.\\n - ``reset`` - Optional. Reset target after programing.\\n - ``exit`` - Optional. Finally exit OpenOCD.\\n - ``compress`` - Optional. Compress image file before programming.\\n - ``encrypt`` - Optional. Encrypt binary before writing to flash. Same functionality with ``idf.py encrypted-flash``\\n\\nYou are now ready to start application debugging. Follow the steps described in the section below.\\n\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-launching-debugger:\\n\\nLaunching Debugger\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe toolchain for {IDF_TARGET_NAME} features GNU Debugger, in short GDB. It is available with other toolchain programs under filename: {IDF_TARGET_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX}-gdb. GDB can be called and operated directly from command line in a terminal. Another option is to call it from within IDE (like Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, etc.) and operate indirectly with help of GUI instead of typing commands in a terminal.\\n\\nThe options of using debugger are discussed under links below.\\n\\n* :ref:`jtag-debugging-using-debugger-eclipse`\\n* :ref:`jtag-debugging-using-debugger-command-line`\\n* `Configuration for Visual Studio Code Debug <https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/blob/master/docs/DEBUGGING.md>`__\\n\\nIt is recommended to first check if debugger works from :ref:`jtag-debugging-using-debugger-command-line` and then move to using :ref:`jtag-debugging-using-debugger-eclipse`.\\n\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-examples:\\n\\nDebugging Examples\\n----------------------\\n\\nThis section is intended for users not familiar with GDB.

The line of code where program halted is highlighted in another window below, as shown on the following picture. The LED stops blinking.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/debugging-target-halted.jpg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Target halted during debugging\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Target halted during debugging\\n\\nSpecific thread where the program halted is expanded showing the call stack. It represents function calls that lead up to the highlighted line of code, where the target halted. The first line of call stack under Thread #1 contains the last called function ``app_main()``, that in turn was called from function ``main_task()`` shown in a line below. Each line of the stack also contains the file name and line number where the function was called. By clicking/highlighting the stack entries, in window below, you will see contents of this file.\\n\\nBy expanding threads you can navigate throughout the application. Expand Thread #5 that contains much longer call stack. You will see there, besides function calls, numbers like ``0x4000000c``. They represent addresses of binary code not provided in source form.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/debugging-navigate-through-the-stack.jpg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Navigate through the call stack\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Navigate through the call stack\\n\\nIn another window on right, you can see the disassembled machine code no matter if your project provides it in source or only the binary form.\\n\\nGo back to the ``app_main()`` in Thread #1 to familiar code of ``blink.c`` file that will be examined in more details in the following examples. Debugger makes it easy to navigate through the code of entire application. This comes handy when stepping through the code and working with breakpoints and will be discussed below.\\n\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-examples-eclipse-02:\\n\\nSetting and Clearing Breakpoints\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen debugging, we would like to be able to stop the application at critical lines of code and then examine the state of specific variables, memory and registers/peripherals. To do so we are using breakpoints. They provide a convenient way to quickly get to and halt the application at specific line.\\n\\nLet\\'s establish two breakpoints when the state of LED changes. Basing on code listing above, this happens at lines 33 and 36. To do so, hold the \"Control\" on the keyboard and double clink on number ``33`` in file ``blink.c`` file. A dialog will open where you can confirm your selection by pressing \"OK\" button. If you do not like to see the dialog just double click the line number. Set another breakpoint in line 36.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/debugging-setting-breakpoint.jpg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Setting a breakpoint\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Setting a breakpoint\\n\\nInformation how many breakpoints are set and where is shown in window \"Breakpoints\" on top right. Click \"Show Breakpoints Supported by Selected Target\" to refresh this list. Besides the two just set breakpoints the list may contain temporary breakpoint at function ``app_main()`` established at debugger start. As maximum two breakpoints are allowed (see :ref:`jtag-debugging-tip-breakpoints`), you need to delete it, or debugging will fail.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/debugging-three-breakpoints-set.jpg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Three breakpoints are set / maximum two are allowed\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Three breakpoints are set / maximum two are allowed\\n\\nIf you now click \"Resume\" (click ``blink_task()`` under \"Tread #8\", if \"Resume\" button is grayed out), the processor will run and halt at a breakpoint. Clicking \"Resume\" another time will make it run again, halt on second breakpoint, and so on.\\n\\nYou will be also able to see that LED is changing the state after each click to \"Resume\" program execution.\\n\\nRead more about breakpoints under :ref:`jtag-debugging-tip-breakpoints` and :ref:`jtag-debugging-tip-where-breakpoints`\\n\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-examples-eclipse-03:\\n\\nHalting the Target Manually\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen debugging, you may resume application and enter code waiting for some event or staying in infinite loop without any break points defined. In such case, to go back to debugging mode, you can break program execution manually by pressing \"Suspend\" button.\\n\\nTo check it, delete all breakpoints and click \"Resume\". Then click \"Suspend\". Application will be halted at some random point and LED will stop blinking. Debugger will expand tread and highlight the line of code where application halted.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/debugging-target-halted-manually.jpg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Target halted manually\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Target halted manually\\n\\nIn particular case above, the application has been halted in line 52 of code in file ``freertos_hooks.c`` Now you can resume it again by pressing \"Resume\" button or do some debugging as discussed below.\\n\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-examples-eclipse-04:\\n\\nStepping Through the Code\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIt is also possible to step through the code using \"Step Into (F5)\" and \"Step Over (F6)\" commands. The difference is that \"Step Into (F5)\" is entering inside subroutines calls, while \"Step Over (F6)\" steps over the call, treating it as a single source line.\\n\\nBefore being able to demonstrate this functionality, using information discussed in previous paragraph, make sure that you have only one breakpoint defined at line ``36`` of ``blink.c``.\\n\\nResume program by entering pressing F8 and let it halt. Now press \"Step Over (F6)\", one by one couple of times, to see how debugger is stepping one program line at a time.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/debugging-step-over.jpg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Stepping through the code with \"Step Over (F6)\"\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Stepping through the code with \"Step Over (F6)\"\\n\\nIf you press \"Step Into (F5)\" instead, then debugger will step inside subroutine calls.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/debugging-step-into.jpg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Stepping through the code with \"Step Into (F5)\"\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Stepping through the code with \"Step Into (F5)\"\\n\\nIn this particular case debugger stepped inside ``gpio_set_level(BLINK_GPIO, 0)`` and effectively moved to ``gpio.c`` driver code.\\n\\nSee :ref:`jtag-debugging-tip-why-next-works-as-step` for potential limitation of using ``next`` command.\\n\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-examples-eclipse-05:\\n\\nChecking and Setting Memory\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTo display or set contents of memory use \"Memory\" tab at the bottom of \"Debug\" perspective.\\n\\nWith the \"Memory\" tab, we will read from and write to the memory location ``0x3FF44004`` labeled as ``GPIO_OUT_REG`` used to set and clear individual GPIO\\'s.\\n\\nFor more information, see *{IDF_TARGET_NAME} Technical Reference Manual* > *IO MUX and GPIO Matrix (GPIO, IO_MUX)* [`PDF <{IDF_TARGET_TRM_EN_URL}#iomuxgpio>`__].\\n\\nBeing in the same ``blink.c`` project as before, set two breakpoints right after ``gpio_set_level`` instruction. Click \"Memory\" tab and then \"Add Memory Monitor\" button. Enter ``0x3FF44004`` in provided dialog.\\n\\nNow resume program by pressing F8 and observe \"Monitor\" tab.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/debugging-memory-location-on.jpg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Observing memory location 0x3FF44004 changing one bit to ON\"\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Observing memory location 0x3FF44004 changing one bit to \"ON\"\\n\\nYou should see one bit being flipped over at memory location ``0x3FF44004`` (and LED changing the state) each time F8 is pressed.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/debugging-memory-location-off.jpg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Observing memory location 0x3FF44004 changing one bit to ON\"\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Observing memory location 0x3FF44004 changing one bit to \"OFF\"\\n\\nTo set memory use the same \"Monitor\" tab and the same memory location.

This will let you check what exact sequence of function calls lead to the code where the target halted. Question marks ``??`` instead of a function name indicate that application is available only in binary format, without any source file in C language. The value like ``0x4000bfea`` is the memory address of the function call.\\n\\nUsing ``bt``, ``i threads``, ``thread N`` and ``list`` commands we are now able to navigate through the code of entire application. This comes handy when stepping through the code and working with breakpoints and will be discussed below.\\n\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-examples-command-line-02:\\n\\nSetting and Clearing Breakpoints\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen debugging, we would like to be able to stop the application at critical lines of code and then examine the state of specific variables, memory and registers/peripherals. To do so we are using breakpoints. They provide a convenient way to quickly get to and halt the application at specific line.\\n\\nLet\\'s establish two breakpoints when the state of LED changes. Basing on code listing above this happens at lines 33 and 36. Breakpoints may be established using command ``break M`` where M is the code line number::\\n\\n    (gdb) break 33\\n    Breakpoint 2 at 0x400db6f6: file /home/user-name/esp/blink/main/./blink.c, line 33.\\n    (gdb) break 36\\n    Breakpoint 3 at 0x400db704: file /home/user-name/esp/blink/main/./blink.c, line 36.\\n\\nIf you new enter ``c``, the processor will run and halt at a breakpoint.

This is because first breakpoint has been already established at function ``app_main()`` by running command ``thb app_main`` on debugger launch. As it was a temporary breakpoint, it has been automatically deleted and now is not listed anymore.\\n\\nTo remove breakpoints enter ``delete N`` command (in short ``d N``), where ``N`` is the breakpoint number::\\n\\n    (gdb) delete 1\\n    No breakpoint number 1.\\n    (gdb) delete 2\\n    (gdb)\\n\\nRead more about breakpoints under :ref:`jtag-debugging-tip-breakpoints` and :ref:`jtag-debugging-tip-where-breakpoints`\\n\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-examples-command-line-03:\\n\\nHalting and Resuming the Application\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen debugging, you may resume application and enter code waiting for some event or staying in infinite loop without any break points defined. In such case, to go back to debugging mode, you can break program execution manually by entering Ctrl+C.\\n\\nTo check it delete all breakpoints and enter ``c`` to resume application. Then enter Ctrl+C. Application will be halted at some random point and LED will stop blinking. Debugger will print the following::\\n\\n    (gdb) c\\n    Continuing.\\n    ^CTarget halted.

The ``freertos`` command is not native to GDB and comes from the `freertos-gdb <https://pypi.org/project/freertos-gdb>`_ Python extension module. The ``freertos`` command contains a series of sub-commands as demonstrated in the code snippet::\\n\\n    (gdb) freertos\\n    \"freertos\" must be followed by the name of a subcommand.\\n    List of freertos subcommands:\\n\\n    freertos queue --  Generate a print out of the current queues info.\\n    freertos semaphore --  Generate a print out of the current semaphores info.\\n    freertos task --  Generate a print out of the current tasks and their states.\\n    freertos timer --  Generate a print out of the current timers info.\\n\\nFor a more detailed description of this extension, please refer to https://pypi.org/project/freertos-gdb.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    The freertos-gdb Python module is included as a Python package requirement by ESP-IDF, thus should be automatically installed (see :ref:`get-started-set-up-tools` for more details).\\n\\n    The FreeRTOS extension automatically loads in case GDB is executed with command via ``idf.py gdb``. Otherwise, the module could be enabled via the ``python import freertos_gdb`` command inside GDB.\\n\\n    Users only need to have Python 3.6 (or above) that contains a Python shared library.\\n\\n\\nObtaining Help on Commands\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nCommands presented so for should provide are very basis and intended to let you quickly get started with JTAG debugging. Check help what are the other commands at you disposal. To obtain help on syntax and functionality of particular command, being at ``(gdb)`` prompt type ``help`` and command name::\\n\\n    (gdb) help next\\n    Step program, proceeding through subroutine calls.\\n    Usage: next [N]\\n    Unlike \"step\", if the current source line calls a subroutine,\\n    this command does not enter the subroutine, but instead steps over\\n    the call, in effect treating it as a single source line.\\n    (gdb)\\n\\nBy typing just ``help``, you will get top level list of command classes, to aid you drilling down to more details.

       " 'Tips and Quirks\\n---------------\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nThis section provides collection of all tips and quirks referred to from various parts of this guide.\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-tip-breakpoints:\\n\\nBreakpoints and Watchpoints Available\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_NAME} debugger supports {IDF_TARGET_SOC_CPU_BREAKPOINTS_NUM} hardware implemented breakpoints and 64 software ones. Hardware breakpoints are implemented by {IDF_TARGET_NAME} chip\\'s logic and can be set anywhere in the code: either in flash or IRAM program\\'s regions. Additionally there are 2 types of software breakpoints implemented by OpenOCD: flash (up to 32) and IRAM (up to 32) breakpoints. Currently GDB can not set software breakpoints in flash. So until this limitation is removed those breakpoints have to be emulated by OpenOCD as hardware ones (see :ref:`below <jtag-debugging-tip-where-breakpoints>` for details). {IDF_TARGET_NAME} also supports {IDF_TARGET_SOC_CPU_WATCHPOINTS_NUM} watchpoints, so {IDF_TARGET_SOC_CPU_WATCHPOINTS_NUM} variables can be watched for change or read by the GDB command ``watch myVariable``. Note that menuconfig option :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_WATCHPOINT_END_OF_STACK` uses the last watchpoint and will not provide expected results, if you also try to use it within OpenOCD/GDB. See menuconfig\\'s help for detailed description.\\n\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-tip-where-breakpoints:\\n\\nWhat Else Should I Know About Breakpoints?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nEmulating part of hardware breakpoints using software flash ones means that the GDB command ``hb myFunction`` which is invoked for function in flash will use pure hardware breakpoint if it is avalable otherwise one of the 32 software flash breakpoints is used. The same rule applies to ``b myFunction``-like commands. In this case GDB will decide what type of breakpoint to set itself. If ``myFunction`` is resided in writable region (IRAM) software IRAM breakpoint will be used otherwise hardware or software flash breakpoint is used as it is done for ``hb`` command.\\n\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-tip-flash-mappings:\\n\\nFlash Mappings vs SW Flash Breakpoints\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn order to set/clear software breakpoints in flash, OpenOCD needs to know their flash addresses. To accomplish conversion from the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} address space to the flash one, OpenOCD uses mappings of program\\'s code regions resided in flash. Those mappings are kept in the image header which is prepended to program binary data (code and data segments) and is specific to every application image written to the flash. So to support software flash breakpoints OpenOCD should know where application image under debugging is resided in the flash. By default OpenOCD reads partition table at 0x8000 and uses mappings from the first found application image, but there can be the cases when it will not work, e.g., partition table is not at standard flash location or even there can be multiple images: one factory and two OTA and you may want to debbug any of them. To cover all possible debugging scenarios OpenOCD supports special command which can be used to set arbitrary location of application image to debug. The command has the following format:\\n\\n``esp appimage_offset <offset>``\\n\\nOffset should be in hex format. To reset to the default behaviour you can specify ``-1`` as offset.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Since GDB requests memory map from OpenOCD only once when connecting to it, this command should be specified in one of the TCL configuration files, or passed to OpenOCD via its command line. In the latter case command line should look like below:\\n\\n    .. highlight:: bash\\n\\n    .. include:: {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}.inc\\n        :start-after: run-openocd-appimage-offset\\n        :end-before: ---\\n\\n    Another option is to execute that command via OpenOCD telnet session and then connect GDB, but it seems to be less handy.\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-tip-why-next-works-as-step:\\n\\nWhy Stepping with \"next\" Does Not Bypass Subroutine Calls?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen stepping through the code with ``next`` command, GDB is internally setting a breakpoint ahead in the code to bypass the subroutine calls. If all {IDF_TARGET_SOC_CPU_BREAKPOINTS_NUM} breakpoints are already set, this functionality will not work. If this is the case, delete breakpoints to have one \"spare\". With all breakpoints already used, stepping through the code with ``next`` command will work as like with ``step`` command and debugger will step inside subroutine calls.\\n\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-tip-code-options:\\n\\nSupport Options for OpenOCD at Compile Time\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-IDF has some support options for OpenOCD debugging which can be set at compile time:\\n\\n* :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_DEBUG_OCDAWARE` is enabled by default. If a panic or unhandled exception is thrown and a JTAG debugger is connected (ie  OpenOCD is running), ESP-IDF will break into the debugger.\\n\\n* :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_WATCHPOINT_END_OF_STACK` (disabled by default) sets watchpoint index 1 (the second of two) at the end of any task stack. This is the most accurate way to debug task stack overflows. Click the link for more details.\\n\\nPlease see the :ref:`project configuration menu <get-started-configure>` menu for more details on setting compile-time options.\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-tip-freertos-support:\\n\\nFreeRTOS Support\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nOpenOCD has explicit support for the ESP-IDF FreeRTOS. GDB can see FreeRTOS tasks as threads. Viewing them all can be done using the GDB ``i threads`` command, changing to a certain task is done with ``thread n``, with ``n`` being the number of the thread. FreeRTOS detection can be disabled in target\\'s configuration. For more details see :ref:`jtag-debugging-tip-openocd-configure-target`.\\n\\nGDB has a Python extension for FreeRTOS support. ESP-IDF automatically loads this module into GDB with the ``idf.py gdb`` command when the system requirements are met. See more details in :ref:`jtag-debugging-examples-command-line-08`.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    .. _jtag-debugging-tip-code-flash-voltage:\\n\\n    Why to Set SPI Flash Voltage in OpenOCD Configuration?\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The MTDI pin of ESP32, being among four pins used for JTAG communication, is also one of ESP32\\'s bootstrapping pins. On power up ESP32 is sampling binary level on MTDI to set it\\'s internal voltage regulator used to supply power to external SPI flash chip. If binary level on MDTI pin on power up is low, the voltage regulator is set to deliver 3.3 V, if it is high, then the voltage is set to 1.8 V. The MTDI pin should have a pull-up or may rely on internal weak pull down resistor (see `ESP32 Series Datasheet <https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32_datasheet_en.pdf>`_ for details), depending on the type of SPI chip used. Once JTAG is connected, it overrides the pull-up or pull-down resistor that is supposed to do the bootstrapping.\\n\\n    To handle this issue OpenOCD\\'s board configuration file (e.g. ``board\\\\esp32-wrover-kit-3.3v.cfg`` for ESP-WROVER-KIT board) provides ``ESP32_FLASH_VOLTAGE`` parameter to set the idle state of the ``TDO`` line to a specified binary level, therefore reducing the chance of a bad bootup of application due to incorrect flash voltage.\\n\\n    Check specification of ESP32 module connected to JTAG, what is the power supply voltage of SPI flash chip. Then set ``ESP32_FLASH_VOLTAGE`` accordingly. Most WROOM modules use 3.3 V flash. WROVER earlier than ESP32-WROVER-B use 1.8 V flash, while ESP32-WROVER-B and -E modules use 3.3 V flash.\\n\\n    .. _jtag-debugging-tip-optimize-jtag-speed:\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n    .. _jtag-debugging-tip-optimize-jtag-speed:\\n\\nOptimize JTAG Speed\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn order to achieve higher data rates and minimize number of dropped packets it is recommended to optimize setting of JTAG clock frequency, so it is at maximum and still provides stable operation of JTAG. To do so use the following tips.\\n\\n1.  The upper limit of JTAG clock frequency is 20 MHz if CPU runs at 80 MHz, or 26 MHz if CPU runs at 160 MHz or 240 MHz.\\n2.  Depending on particular JTAG adapter and the length of connecting cables, you may need to reduce JTAG frequency below 20 MHz or 26 MHz.\\n3.  In particular reduce frequency, if you get DSR/DIR errors (and they do not relate to OpenOCD trying to read from a memory range without physical memory being present there).\\n4.  ESP-WROVER-KIT operates stable at 20 MHz or 26 MHz.\\n\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-tip-debugger-startup-commands:\\n\\nWhat Is the Meaning of Debugger\\'s Startup Commands?\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nOn startup, debugger is issuing sequence of commands to reset the chip and halt it at specific line of code. This sequence (shown below) is user defined to pick up at most convenient/appropriate line and start debugging.\\n\\n* ``set remote hardware-watchpoint-limit {IDF_TARGET_SOC_CPU_WATCHPOINTS_NUM}`` — Restrict GDB to using available hardware watchpoints supported by the chip, {IDF_TARGET_SOC_CPU_WATCHPOINTS_NUM} for {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. For more information see https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Remote-Configuration.html.\\n* ``mon reset halt`` — reset the chip and keep the CPUs halted\\n* ``maintenance flush register-cache`` — monitor (``mon``) command can not inform GDB that the target state has changed. GDB will assume that whatever stack the target had before ``mon reset halt`` will still be valid. In fact, after reset the target state will change, and executing ``maintenance flush register-cache`` is a way to force GDB to get new state from the target.\\n* ``thb app_main`` — insert a temporary hardware breakpoint at ``app_main``, put here another function name if required\\n* ``c`` — resume the program. It will then stop at breakpoint inserted at ``app_main``.\\n\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-tip-openocd-configure-target:\\n\\nConfiguration of OpenOCD for Specific Target\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThere are several kinds of OpenOCD configuration files (``*.cfg``). All configuration files are located in subdirectories of ``share/openocd/scripts`` directory of OpenOCD distribution (or ``tcl/scripts`` directory of the source repository). For the purposes of this guide, the most important ones are ``board``, ``interface`` and ``target``.\\n\\n* ``interface`` configuration files describe the JTAG adapter. Examples of JTAG adapters are ESP-Prog and J-Link.\\n* ``target`` configuration files describe specific chips, or in some cases, modules.\\n* ``board`` configuration files are provided for development boards with a built-in JTAG adapter. Such files include an ``interface`` configuration file to choose the adapter, and ``target`` configuration file to choose the chip/module.\\n\\nThe following configuration files are available for {IDF_TARGET_NAME}:\\n\\n.. include:: {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}.inc\\n    :start-after: openocd-cfg-files\\n    :end-before: ---\\n\\n\\nIf you are using one of the boards which have a pre-defined configuration file, you only need to pass one ``-f`` argument to OpenOCD, specifying that file.\\n\\nIf you are using a board not listed here, you need to specify both the interface configuration file and target configuration file.\\n\\nCustom Configuration Files\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nOpenOCD configuration files are written in TCL, and include a variety of choices for customization and scripting. This can be useful for non-standard debugging situations. Please refer to `OpenOCD Manual`_ for the TCL scripting reference.\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-tip-openocd-config-vars:\\n\\nOpenOCD Configuration Variables\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nThe following variables can be optionally set before including the ESP-specific target configuration file. This can be done either in a custom configuration file, or from the command line.\\n\\nThe syntax for setting a variable in TCL is:\\n\\n.. code-block:: tcl\\n\\n    set VARIABLE_NAME value\\n\\nTo set a variable from the command line (replace the name of .cfg file with the correct file for your board):\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    openocd -c \\'set VARIABLE_NAME value\\' -f board/esp-xxxxx-kit.cfg\\n\\nIt is important to set the variable before including the ESP-specific configuration file, otherwise the variable will not have effect.

By default, {IDF_TARGET_NAME} JTAG interface is connected to the built-in USB SERIAL/JTAG peripheral. For details, please refer to :doc:`Configure {IDF_TARGET_NAME} built-in JTAG Interface <../jtag-debugging/configure-builtin-jtag>`.\\n\\n    When you use USB Serial/JTAG Controller for debugging, |jtag-gpio-list| can be used for other purposes.\\n\\n    However, if you switch the USB JTAG interface to the GPIOs by burning eFuses, |jtag-gpio-list| can be used for JTAG debugging. When they perform this function, they cannot be used for other purposes.\\n\\nOperation of JTAG may be disturbed, if some other hardware is connected to JTAG pins besides {IDF_TARGET_NAME} module and JTAG adapter. {IDF_TARGET_NAME} JTAG is using the following pins:\\n\\n.. include:: {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}.inc\\n    :start-after: jtag-pins\\n    :end-before: ---\\n\\nJTAG communication will likely fail, if configuration of JTAG pins is changed by a user application. If OpenOCD initializes correctly (detects all the CPU cores in the SOC), but loses sync and spews out a lot of DTR/DIR errors when the program is running, it is likely that the application reconfigures the JTAG pins to something else, or the user forgot to connect Vtar to a JTAG adapter that requires it.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    .. highlight:: none\\n\\n    Below is an excerpt from series of errors on the dual-core {IDF_TARGET_NAME} reported by GDB after the application stepped into the code that reconfigured MTDO pin to be an input::\\n\\n        cpu0: xtensa_resume (line 431): DSR (FFFFFFFF) indicates target still busy!\\n        cpu0: xtensa_resume (line 431): DSR (FFFFFFFF) indicates DIR instruction generated an exception!\\n        cpu0: xtensa_resume (line 431): DSR (FFFFFFFF) indicates DIR instruction generated an overrun!\\n        cpu1: xtensa_resume (line 431): DSR (FFFFFFFF) indicates target still busy!\\n        cpu1: xtensa_resume (line 431): DSR (FFFFFFFF) indicates DIR instruction generated an exception!\\n        cpu1: xtensa_resume (line 431): DSR (FFFFFFFF) indicates DIR instruction generated an overrun!\\n\\n.. _jtag-debugging-security-features:\\n\\nJTAG with Flash Encryption or Secure Boot\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy default, enabling Flash Encryption and/or Secure Boot will disable JTAG debugging. On first boot, the bootloader will burn an eFuse bit to permanently disable JTAG at the same time it enables the other features.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_HMAC_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Please note that once JTAG is permanently disabled, it cannot be re-enabled for JTAG access. However, we do have the option of disabling JTAG softly. For more details on soft disabling and re-enabling soft-disabled JTAG, please refer to the :ref:`hmac_for_enabling_jtag`.\\n\\nThe project configuration option :ref:`CONFIG_SECURE_BOOT_ALLOW_JTAG` will keep JTAG enabled at this time, removing all physical security but allowing debugging. (Although the name suggests Secure Boot, this option can be applied even when only Flash Encryption is enabled).\\n\\nHowever, OpenOCD may attempt to automatically read and write the flash in order to set :ref:`software breakpoints <jtag-debugging-tip-where-breakpoints>`. This has two problems:\\n\\n- Software breakpoints are incompatible with Flash Encryption, OpenOCD currently has no support for encrypting or decrypting flash contents.\\n- If Secure Boot is enabled, setting a software breakpoint will change the digest of a signed app and make the signature invalid. This means if a software breakpoint is set and then a reset occurs, the signature verification will fail on boot.\\n\\nTo disable software breakpoints while using JTAG, add an extra argument ``-c \\'set ESP_FLASH_SIZE 0\\'`` to the start of the OpenOCD command line, see :ref:`jtag-debugging-tip-openocd-config-vars`.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   For the same reason, the ESP-IDF app may fail bootloader verification of app signatures, when this option is enabled and a software breakpoint is set.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n    JTAG and ESP32-WROOM-32 AT Firmware Compatibility Issue\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    The ESP32-WROOM series of modules come pre-flashed with AT firmware.

When the OS loads FTDI serial port driver, it does so for both channels of FT2232 chip. However only one of these channels is used as a serial port, while the other is used as JTAG. If the OS has loaded FTDI serial port driver for the channel used for JTAG, OpenOCD will not be able to connect to the chip. There are two ways around this:\\n\\n1. Manually unload the FTDI serial port driver before starting OpenOCD, start OpenOCD, then load the serial port driver.\\n\\n2. Modify FTDI driver configuration so that it does not load itself for channel A of FT2232 chip, which is the channel used for JTAG on |devkit-name|.\\n\\nManually unloading the driver\\n.............................\\n\\n1. Install FTDI driver from https://ftdichip.com/drivers/vcp-drivers/\\n\\n2. Connect USB cable to the |devkit-name|.\\n\\n3. Unload the serial port driver::\\n\\n    sudo kextunload -b com.FTDI.driver.FTDIUSBSerialDriver\\n\\n   In some cases you may need to unload Apple\\'s FTDI driver as well:\\n\\n   * macOS < 10.15::\\n\\n        sudo kextunload -b com.apple.driver.AppleUSBFTDI\\n\\n   * macOS 10.15::\\n\\n        sudo kextunload -b com.apple.DriverKit-AppleUSBFTDI\\n\\n   .. warning::\\n\\n      Attempting to use serial over the wrong channel with the FTDI driver will cause a kernel panic. The ESP-WROVER-KIT uses channel A for JTAG and channel B for serial.\\n\\n4. Run OpenOCD:\\n\\n   .. include:: {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}.inc\\n       :start-after: run-openocd\\n       :end-before: ---\\n\\n5. In another terminal window, load FTDI serial port driver again::\\n\\n    sudo kextload -b com.FTDI.driver.FTDIUSBSerialDriver\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   If you need to restart OpenOCD, there is no need to unload FTDI driver again — just stop OpenOCD and start it again. The driver only needs to be unloaded if |devkit-name| was reconnected or power was toggled.\\n\\nThis procedure can be wrapped into a shell script, if desired.\\n\\nModifying FTDI driver\\n.....................\\n\\nIn a nutshell, this approach requires modification to FTDI driver configuration file, which prevents the driver from being loaded for channel B of FT2232H.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Other boards may use channel A for JTAG, so use this option with caution.\\n\\n.. warning::\\n\\n    This approach also needs signature verification of drivers to be disabled, so may not be acceptable for all users.\\n\\n\\n1. Open FTDI driver configuration file using a text editor (note ``sudo``)::\\n\\n    sudo nano /Library/Extensions/FTDIUSBSerialDriver.kext/Contents/Info.plist\\n\\n2. Find and delete the following lines::\\n\\n        <key>FT2232H_B</key>\\n        <dict>\\n            <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>\\n            <string>com.FTDI.driver.FTDIUSBSerialDriver</string>\\n            <key>IOClass</key>\\n            <string>FTDIUSBSerialDriver</string>\\n            <key>IOProviderClass</key>\\n            <string>IOUSBInterface</string>\\n            <key>bConfigurationValue</key>\\n            <integer>1</integer>\\n            <key>bInterfaceNumber</key>\\n            <integer>1</integer>\\n            <key>bcdDevice</key>\\n            <integer>1792</integer>\\n            <key>idProduct</key>\\n            <integer>24592</integer>\\n            <key>idVendor</key>\\n            <integer>1027</integer>\\n        </dict>\\n\\n3. Save and close the file\\n\\n4. Disable driver signature verification:\\n\\n   1. Open Apple logo menu, choose \"Restart...\"\\n\\n   2. When you hear the chime after reboot, press CMD+R immediately\\n\\n   3. Once Recovery mode starts up, open Terminal\\n\\n   4. Run the command::\\n\\n       csrutil enable --without kext\\n\\n   5. Restart again\\n\\nAfter these steps, serial port and JTAG can be used at the same time.\\n\\nTo carry on with debugging environment setup, proceed to section :ref:`jtag-debugging-run-openocd`.\\n',\n",

Both are static variables and reduce the total available RAM at runtime, but ``.bss`` does not contribute to the binary file size. ``other`` is a column for any custom section types that also contribute to RAM size. Usually, the value is 0.\\n    :esp32: - ``IRAM`` - is the same as for the totals shown above.

Therefore we can guess that this application is using the :doc:`/api-reference/protocols/esp_crt_bundle` feature and not using this feature would save at last this many bytes from the firmware size.\\n\\nSome of the object files are linked from binary libraries and therefore you will not find a corresponding source file. To locate which component a source file belongs to, it is generally possible to search in the ESP-IDF source tree or look in the :ref:`linker-map-file`  for the full path.\\n\\nComparing Two Binaries\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf making some changes that affect binary size, it is possible to use an ESP-IDF tool to break down the exact differences in size.\\n\\nThis operation is not part of ``idf.py``, it is necessary to run the `esp_idf_size <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf-size>`_ Python tool directly.\\n\\nTo do so, first, locate the linker map file with the name ``PROJECTNAME.map`` in the build directory. The ``esp_idf_size`` tool performs its analysis based on the output of the linker map file.\\n\\nTo compare with another binary, you also need its corresponding ``.map`` file saved from the build directory.\\n\\nFor example, to compare two builds, one of which with the default :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION` setting ``Debug (-Og)`` configuration while another with ``Optimize for size (-Os)``:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    $ python -m esp_idf_size --diff build_Og/https_request.map build_Os/https_request.map\\n    <CURRENT> MAP file: build_Os/https_request.map\\n    <REFERENCE> MAP file: build_Og/https_request.map\\n    Difference is counted as <CURRENT> - <REFERENCE>, i.e. a positive number means that <CURRENT> is larger.\\n    Total sizes of <CURRENT>:                                                 <REFERENCE>     Difference\\n     DRAM .data size:   14516 bytes                                                 14956           -440\\n     DRAM .bss  size:   15792 bytes                                                 15808            -16\\n    Used static DRAM:   30308 bytes ( 150428 available, 16.8% used)                 30764           -456 (   +456 available,      +0 total)\\n    Used static IRAM:   78498 bytes (  52574 available, 59.9% used)                 83918          -5420 (  +5420 available,      +0 total)\\n          Flash code:  509183 bytes                                                559943         -50760\\n        Flash rodata:  170592 bytes                                                176736          -6144\\n    Total image size:~ 772789 bytes (.bin may be padded larger)                    835553         -62764\\n\\nWe can see from the ``Difference`` column that changing this one setting caused the whole binary to be over 60 KB smaller and over 5 KB more RAM is available.\\n\\nIt is also possible to use the ``diff`` mode to output a table of component-level (static library archive) differences:\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    To get the output in JSON or CSV format using ``esp_idf_size``, it is possible to use the ``--format`` option.\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    python -m esp_idf_size --archives --diff build_Og/https_request.map build_Oshttps_request.map\\n\\nAlso at the individual source file level:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    python -m esp_idf_size --files --diff build_Og/https_request.map build_Oshttps_request.map\\n\\nOther options, like writing the output to a file, are available, pass ``--help`` to see the full list.\\n\\n.. _idf-size-linker-failed:\\n\\nShowing Size When Linker Fails\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIf too much static memory is allocated, the linker will fail with an error such as ``DRAM segment data does not fit``, ``region `iram0_0_seg\\' overflowed by 44 bytes``, or similar.\\n\\nIn these cases, ``idf.py size`` will not succeed either. However, it is possible to run ``esp_idf_size`` manually to view the **partial static memory usage**. The memory usage will miss the variables that could not be linked, so there still appears to be some free space.\\n\\nThe map file argument is ``<projectname>.map`` in the build directory.\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    python -m esp_idf_size build/project_name.map\\n\\nIt is also possible to view the equivalent of ``size-components`` or ``size-files`` output:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    python -m esp_idf_size --archives build/project_name.map\\n    python -m esp_idf_size --files build/project_name.map\\n\\n.. _linker-map-file:\\n\\nLinker Map File\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    This is an advanced analysis method, but it can be very useful. Feel free to skip ahead to :ref:`reducing-overall-size` and possibly come back to this later.\\n\\nThe ``idf.py size`` analysis tools all work by parsing the GNU binutils ``linker map file``, which is a summary of everything the linker did when it created (i.e., linked) the final firmware binary file.\\n\\nLinker map files themselves are plain text files, so it is possible to read them and find out exactly what the linker did. However, they are also very complex and long, often exceeding 100,000 lines.\\n\\nThe map file itself is broken into parts and each part has a heading. The parts are:\\n\\n- ``Archive member included to satisfy reference by file (symbol)``\\n\\n    - This shows you: for each object file included in the link, what symbol (function or variable) was the linker searching for when it included that object file.\\n    - If you are wondering why some object file in particular was included in the binary, this part may give a clue. This part can be used in conjunction with the ``Cross Reference Table`` at the end of the file.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Not every object file shown in this list ends up included in the final binary, some end up in the ``Discarded input sections`` list instead.\\n\\n- ``Allocating common symbols``\\n\\n    - This is a list of some global variables along with their sizes. Common symbols have a particular meaning in ELF binary files, but ESP-IDF does not make much use of them.\\n\\n- ``Discarded input sections``\\n\\n    - These sections were read by the linker as part of an object file to be linked into the final binary, but then nothing else referred to them, so they were discarded from the final binary.\\n    - For ESP-IDF, this list can be very long, as we compile each function and static variable to a unique section in order to minimize the final binary size. Specifically, ESP-IDF uses compiler options ``-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections`` and linker option ``--gc-sections``.\\n    - Items mentioned in this list **do not** contribute to the final binary.\\n\\n- ``Memory Configuration``, ``Linker script and memory map``\\n\\n    - These two parts go together. Some of the output comes directly from the linker command line and the Linker Script, both provided by :doc:`/api-guides/build-system`. The linker script is partially generated from the ESP-IDF project using the :doc:`/api-guides/linker-script-generation` feature.\\n\\n    - As the output of the ``Linker script and memory map`` part of the map unfolds, you can see each symbol (function or static variable) linked into the final binary along with its address (as a 16 digit hex number), its length (also in hex), and the library and object file it was linked from (which can be used to determine the component and the source file).\\n\\n    - Following all of the output sections that take up space in the final ``.bin`` file, the ``memory map`` also includes some sections in the ELF file that are only used for debugging, e.g., ELF sections ``.debug_*``, etc. These do not contribute to the final binary size. You can notice the address of these symbols is a very small number, starting from ``0x0000000000000000`` and counting up.\\n\\n- ``Cross Reference Table``\\n\\n    - This table shows the symbol (function or static variable) that the list of object file(s) refers to. If you are wondering why a particular thing is included in the binary, this will help determine what included it.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Unfortunately, the ``Cross Reference Table`` does not only include symbols that made it into the final binary. It also includes symbols in discarded sections. Therefore, just because something is shown here does not mean that it was included in the final binary - this needs to be checked separately.\\n\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   Linker map files are generated by the GNU binutils linker ``ld``, not ESP-IDF. You can find additional information online about the linker map file format. This quick summary is written from the perspective of ESP-IDF build system in particular.\\n\\n.. _reducing-overall-size:\\n\\nReducing Overall Size\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe following configuration options reduces the final binary size of almost any ESP-IDF project:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - Set :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION` to ``Optimize for size (-Os)``. In some cases, ``Optimize for performance (-O2)`` will also reduce the binary size compared to the default. Note that if your code contains C or C++ Undefined Behavior then increasing the compiler optimization level may expose bugs that otherwise do not happen.\\n    - Reduce the compiled-in log output by lowering the app :ref:`CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL`. If the :ref:`CONFIG_LOG_MAXIMUM_LEVEL` is changed from the default then this setting controls the binary size instead. Reducing compiled-in logging reduces the number of strings in the binary, and also the code size of the calls to logging functions.\\n    - Set the :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_ASSERTION_LEVEL` to ``Silent``. This avoids compiling in a dedicated assertion string and source file name for each assert that may fail. It is still possible to find the failed assert in the code by looking at the memory address where the assertion failed.\\n    - Besides the :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_ASSERTION_LEVEL`, you can disable or silent the assertion for the HAL component separately by setting :ref:`CONFIG_HAL_DEFAULT_ASSERTION_LEVEL`. It is to notice that ESP-IDF lowers the HAL assertion level in bootloader to be silent even if :ref:`CONFIG_HAL_DEFAULT_ASSERTION_LEVEL` is set to full-assertion level. This is to reduce the bootloader size.\\n    - Setting :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_CHECKS_SILENT` removes specific error messages for particular internal ESP-IDF error check macros. This may make it harder to debug some error conditions by reading the log output.\\n    :esp32: - If the binary needs to run on only certain revision(s) of ESP32, increasing :ref:`CONFIG_ESP32_REV_MIN` to match can result in a reduced binary size. This will make a large difference if setting ESP32 minimum revision 3, and PSRAM is enabled.\\n    :esp32c3: - If the binary needs to run on only certain revision(s) of ESP32-C3, increasing :ref:`CONFIG_ESP32C3_REV_MIN` to match can result in a reduced binary size. This is particularly true if setting ESP32-C3 minimum revision 3 and using Wi-Fi, as some functionality was moved to ROM code.\\n    - Do not enable :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_CXX_EXCEPTIONS`, :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_CXX_RTTI`, or set the :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_STACK_CHECK_MODE` to Overall. All of these options are already disabled by default, but they have a large impact on binary size.\\n    - Disabling :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_ERR_TO_NAME_LOOKUP` removes the lookup table to translate user-friendly names for error values (see :doc:`/api-guides/error-handling`) in error logs, etc. This saves some binary size, but error values will be printed as integers only.\\n    - Setting :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_PANIC` to ``Silent reboot`` saves a small amount of binary size, however this is **only** recommended if no one will use UART output to debug the device.\\n    :CONFIG_IDF_TARGET_ARCH_RISCV: - Seting :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_SAVE_RESTORE_LIBCALLS` reduces binary size by replacing inlined prologues/epilogues with library calls.\\n    - If the application binary uses only one of the security versions of the protocomm component, then the support for others can be disabled to save some code size. The support can be disabled through :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_PROTOCOMM_SUPPORT_SECURITY_VERSION_0`, :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_PROTOCOMM_SUPPORT_SECURITY_VERSION_1` or :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_PROTOCOMM_SUPPORT_SECURITY_VERSION_2` respectively.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   In addition to the many configuration items shown here, there are a number of configuration options where changing the option from the default increases binary size. These are not noted here. Where the increase is significant is usually noted in the configuration item help text.\\n\\n.. _size-targeted-optimizations:\\n\\nTargeted Optimizations\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe following binary size optimizations apply to a particular component or a function:\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED\\n\\n    Wi-Fi\\n    @@@@@\\n\\n    - Disabling :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_ENABLE_WPA3_SAE` will save some Wi-Fi binary size if WPA3 support is not needed.

When filesystem or file-like peripheral driver functionality is not used in the application, this feature can be fully or partially disabled. VFS component provides the following configuration options:\\n\\n* :ref:`CONFIG_VFS_SUPPORT_TERMIOS` — can be disabled if the application does not use ``termios`` family of functions. Currently, these functions are implemented only for UART VFS driver. Most applications can disable this option. Disabling this option reduces the code size by about 1.8 KB.\\n* :ref:`CONFIG_VFS_SUPPORT_SELECT` —\\xa0can be disabled if the application does not use the ``select`` function with file descriptors. Currently, only the UART and eventfd VFS drivers implement ``select`` support. Note that when this option is disabled, ``select`` can still be used for socket file descriptors. Disabling this option reduces the code size by about 2.7 KB.\\n* :ref:`CONFIG_VFS_SUPPORT_DIR` — can be disabled if the application does not use directory-related functions, such as ``readdir`` (see the description of this option for the complete list). Applications that only open, read and write specific files and do not need to enumerate or create directories can disable this option, reducing the code size by 0.5 KB or more, depending on the filesystem drivers in use.\\n* :ref:`CONFIG_VFS_SUPPORT_IO` — can be disabled if the application does not use filesystems or file-like peripheral drivers. This disables all VFS functionality, including the three options mentioned above. When this option is disabled, :doc:`/api-reference/system/console` can not be used. Note that the application can still use standard I/O functions with socket file descriptors when this option is disabled.

       " 'Performance\\n===========\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nESP-IDF ships with default settings that are designed for a trade-off between performance, resource usage, and available functionality.\\n\\nThese guides describe how to optimize a firmware application for a particular aspect of performance. Usually this involves some trade-off in terms of limiting available functions, or swapping one aspect of performance (such as execution speed) for another (such as RAM usage).\\n\\nHow to Optimize Performance\\n---------------------------\\n\\n1. Decide the performance-critical aspects of your application, such as achieving a particular response time for a certain network operation, meeting a particular startup time limit, or maintaining a certain level of peripheral data throughput.\\n2. Find a way to measure this performance (some methods are outlined in the guides below).\\n3. Modify the code and project configuration and compare the new measurement to the old measurement.\\n4. Repeat step 3 until the performance meets the requirements set out in step 1.\\n\\nGuides\\n------\\n\\n.. toctree::\\n   :maxdepth: 2\\n\\n   speed\\n   size\\n   ram-usage\\n',\n",
       " 'Speed Optimization\\n==================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_CONTROLLER_CORE_CONFIG:default=\"CONFIG_BT_CTRL_PINNED_TO_CORE\", esp32=\"CONFIG_BTDM_CTRL_PINNED_TO_CORE_CHOICE\", esp32s3=\"CONFIG_BT_CTRL_PINNED_TO_CORE_CHOICE\"}\\n{IDF_TARGET_RF_TYPE:default=\"Wi-Fi/Bluetooth\", esp32s2=\"Wi-Fi\", esp32c6=\"Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/802.15.4\", esp32h2=\"Bluetooth/802.15.4\"}\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nOptimizing execution speed is a key element of software performance. Code that executes faster can also have other positive effects, e.g., reducing overall power consumption. However, improving execution speed may have trade-offs with other aspects of performance such as :doc:`size`.\\n\\nChoose What to Optimize\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIf a function in the application firmware is executed once per week in the background, it may not matter if that function takes 10 ms or 100 ms to execute. If a function is executed constantly at 10 Hz, it matters greatly if it takes 10 ms or 100 ms to execute.\\n\\nMost kinds of application firmware only have a small set of functions that require optimal performance. Perhaps those functions are executed very often, or have to meet some application requirements for latency or throughput. Optimization efforts should be targeted at these particular functions.\\n\\nMeasuring Performance\\n---------------------\\n\\nThe first step to improving something is to measure it.\\n\\nBasic Performance Measurements\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nYou may be able to measure directly the performance relative to an external interaction with the world, e.g., see the examples :example:`wifi/iperf` and :example:`ethernet/iperf` for measuring general network performance. Or you can use an oscilloscope or logic analyzer to measure the timing of an interaction with a device peripheral.\\n\\nOtherwise, one way to measure performance is to augment the code to take timing measurements:\\n\\n.. code-block:: c\\n\\n    #include \"esp_timer.h\"\\n\\n    void measure_important_function(void) {\\n        const unsigned MEASUREMENTS = 5000;\\n        uint64_t start = esp_timer_get_time();\\n\\n        for (int retries = 0; retries < MEASUREMENTS; retries++) {\\n            important_function(); // This is the thing you need to measure\\n        }\\n\\n        uint64_t end = esp_timer_get_time();\\n\\n        printf(\"%u iterations took %llu milliseconds (%llu microseconds per invocation)\\\\n\",\\n               MEASUREMENTS, (end - start)/1000, (end - start)/MEASUREMENTS);\\n    }\\n\\nExecuting the target multiple times can help average out factors, e.g., RTOS context switches, overhead of measurements, etc.\\n\\n- Using :cpp:func:`esp_timer_get_time` generates \"wall clock\" timestamps with microsecond precision, but has moderate overhead each time the timing functions are called.\\n- It is also possible to use the standard Unix ``gettimeofday()`` and ``utime()`` functions, although the overhead is slightly higher.\\n- Otherwise, including ``hal/cpu_hal.h`` and calling the HAL function ``cpu_hal_get_cycle_count()`` returns the number of CPU cycles executed. This function has lower overhead than the others, which is good for measuring very short execution times with high precision.\\n\\n  .. only:: SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES\\n\\n      The CPU cycles are counted per-core, so only use this method from an interrupt handler, or a task that is pinned to a single core.\\n\\n- While performing \"microbenchmarks\" (i.e., benchmarking only a very small routine of code that runs in less than 1-2 milliseconds), the flash cache performance can sometimes cause big variations in timing measurements depending on the binary. This happens because binary layout can cause different patterns of cache misses in a particular sequence of execution. If the test code is larger, then this effect usually averages out. Executing a small function multiple times when benchmarking can help reduce the impact of flash cache misses. Alternatively, move this code to IRAM (see :ref:`speed-targeted-optimizations`).\\n\\nExternal Tracing\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe :doc:`/api-guides/app_trace` allows measuring code execution with minimal impact on the code itself.\\n\\nTasks\\n^^^^^\\n\\nIf the option :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_GENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS` is enabled, then the FreeRTOS API :cpp:func:`vTaskGetRunTimeStats` can be used to retrieve runtime information about the processor time used by each FreeRTOS task.\\n\\n:ref:`SEGGER SystemView <app_trace-system-behaviour-analysis-with-segger-systemview>` is an excellent tool for visualizing task execution and looking for performance issues or improvements in the system as a whole.\\n\\nImproving Overall Speed\\n-----------------------\\n\\nThe following optimizations improve the execution of nearly all code, including boot times, throughput, latency, etc:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    :esp32: - Set :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHFREQ` to 80 MHz. This is double the 40 MHz default value and doubles the speed at which code is loaded or executed from flash. You should verify that the board or module that connects the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} to the flash chip is rated for 80 MHz operation at the relevant temperature ranges before changing this setting. This information is contained in the hardware datasheet(s).\\n    - Set :ref:`CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHMODE` to QIO or QOUT mode (Quad I/O). Both almost double the speed at which code is loaded or executed from flash compared to the default DIO mode. QIO is slightly faster than QOUT if both are supported. Note that both the flash chip model, and the electrical connections between the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} and the flash chip must support quad I/O modes or the SoC will not work correctly.\\n    - Set :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION` to ``Optimize for performance (-O2)`` . This may slightly increase binary size compared to the default setting, but almost certainly increases the performance of some code. Note that if your code contains C or C++ Undefined Behavior, then increasing the compiler optimization level may expose bugs that otherwise are not seen.\\n    :SOC_ASSIST_DEBUG_SUPPORTED: - Set :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_HW_STACK_GUARD` to disabled. This may slightly increase the performance of some code, especially in cases where a lot of interrupts occur on the device.\\n    :esp32: - If the application uses PSRAM and is based on ESP32 rev. 3 (ECO3), setting :ref:`CONFIG_ESP32_REV_MIN` to ``3`` disables PSRAM bug workarounds, reducing the code size and improving overall performance.\\n    :SOC_CPU_HAS_FPU: - Avoid using floating point arithmetic ``float``. Even though {IDF_TARGET_NAME} has a single precision hardware floating point unit, floating point calculations are always slower than integer calculations. If possible then use fixed point representations, a different method of integer representation, or convert part of the calculation to be integer only before switching to floating point.\\n    :not SOC_CPU_HAS_FPU: - Avoid using floating point arithmetic ``float``. On {IDF_TARGET_NAME} these calculations are emulated in software and are very slow. If possible, use fixed point representations, a different method of integer representation, or convert part of the calculation to be integer only before switching to floating point.\\n    - Avoid using double precision floating point arithmetic ``double``. These calculations are emulated in software and are very slow. If possible then use an integer-based representation, or single-precision floating point.\\n\\nReduce Logging Overhead\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAlthough standard output is buffered, it is possible for an application to be limited by the rate at which it can print data to log output once buffers are full. This is particularly relevant for startup time if a lot of output is logged, but such problem can happen at other times as well. There are multiple ways to solve this problem:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - Reduce the volume of log output by lowering the app :ref:`CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL` (the equivalent bootloader setting is :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_LOG_LEVEL`). This also reduces the binary size, and saves some CPU time spent on string formatting.\\n    :not SOC_USB_OTG_SUPPORTED: - Increase the speed of logging output by increasing the :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_UART_BAUDRATE`.\\n    :SOC_USB_OTG_SUPPORTED: - Increase the speed of logging output by increasing the :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_UART_BAUDRATE`. However, if you are using internal USB-CDC, the serial throughput is not dependent on the configured baud rate.\\n\\nNot Recommended\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe following options also increase execution speed, but are not recommended as they also reduce the debuggability of the firmware application and may increase the severity of any bugs.\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n   - Set :ref:`CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_ASSERTION_LEVEL` to disabled. This also reduces firmware binary size by a small amount. However, it may increase the severity of bugs in the firmware including security-related bugs. If it is necessary to do this to optimize a particular function, consider adding ``#define NDEBUG`` at the top of that single source file instead.\\n\\n.. _speed-targeted-optimizations:\\n\\nTargeted Optimizations\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe following changes increase the speed of a chosen part of the firmware application:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - Move frequently executed code to IRAM. By default, all code in the app is executed from flash cache. This means that it is possible for the CPU to have to wait on a \"cache miss\" while the next instructions are loaded from flash. Functions which are copied into IRAM are loaded once at boot time, and then always execute at full speed.\\n\\n      IRAM is a limited resource, and using more IRAM may reduce available DRAM, so a strategic approach is needed when moving code to IRAM. See :ref:`iram` for more information.\\n\\n    -  Jump table optimizations can be re-enabled for individual source files that do not need to be placed in IRAM. For hot paths in large ``switch cases``, this improves performance. For instructions on how to add the ``-fjump-tables`` and ``-ftree-switch-conversion`` options when compiling individual source files, see :ref:`component_build_control`\\n\\nImproving Startup Time\\n----------------------\\n\\nIn addition to the overall performance improvements shown above, the following options can be tweaked to specifically reduce startup time:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n   - Minimizing the :ref:`CONFIG_LOG_DEFAULT_LEVEL` and :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_LOG_LEVEL` has a large impact on startup time. To enable more logging after the app starts up, set the :ref:`CONFIG_LOG_MAXIMUM_LEVEL` as well, and then call :cpp:func:`esp_log_level_set` to restore higher level logs. The :example:`system/startup_time` main function shows how to do this.\\n   :SOC_RTC_FAST_MEM_SUPPORTED: - If using Deep-sleep mode, setting :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_SKIP_VALIDATE_IN_DEEP_SLEEP` allows a faster wake from sleep. Note that if using Secure Boot, this represents a security compromise, as Secure Boot validation are not be performed on wake.\\n   - Setting :ref:`CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_SKIP_VALIDATE_ON_POWER_ON` skips verifying the binary on every boot from the power-on reset. How much time this saves depends on the binary size and the flash settings. Note that this setting carries some risk if the flash becomes corrupt unexpectedly. Read the help text of the :ref:`config item <CONFIG_BOOTLOADER_SKIP_VALIDATE_ON_POWER_ON>` for an explanation and recommendations if using this option.\\n   - It is possible to save a small amount of time during boot by disabling RTC slow clock calibration. To do so, set :ref:`CONFIG_RTC_CLK_CAL_CYCLES` to 0. Any part of the firmware that uses RTC slow clock as a timing source will be less accurate as a result.\\n\\nThe example project :example:`system/startup_time` is pre-configured to optimize startup time. The file :example_file:`system/startup_time/sdkconfig.defaults` contain all of these settings. You can append these to the end of your project\\'s own ``sdkconfig`` file to merge the settings, but please read the documentation for each setting first.\\n\\nTask Priorities\\n---------------\\n\\nAs ESP-IDF FreeRTOS is a real-time operating system, it is necessary to ensure that high-throughput or low-slatency tasks are granted a high priority in order to run immediately. Priority is set when calling :cpp:func:`xTaskCreate` or :cpp:func:`xTaskCreatePinnedToCore` and can be changed at runtime by calling :cpp:func:`vTaskPrioritySet`.\\n\\nIt is also necessary to ensure that tasks yield CPU (by calling :cpp:func:`vTaskDelay`, ``sleep()``, or by blocking on semaphores, queues, task notifications, etc) in order to not starve lower-priority tasks and cause problems for the overall system. The :ref:`task-watchdog-timer` provides a mechanism to automatically detect if task starvation happens. However, note that a TWDT timeout does not always indicate a problem, because sometimes the correct operation of the firmware requires some long-running computation. In these cases, tweaking the TWDT timeout or even disabling the TWDT may be necessary.\\n\\n.. _built-in-task-priorities:\\n\\nBuilt-in Task Priorities\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-IDF starts a number of system tasks at fixed priority levels. Some are automatically started during the boot process, while some are started only if the application firmware initializes a particular feature. To optimize performance, structure the task priorities of your application properly to ensure the tasks are not delayed by the system tasks, while also not starving system tasks and impacting other functions of the system.\\n\\nThis may require splitting up a particular task. For example, perform a time-critical operation in a high-priority task or an interrupt handler and do the non-time-critical part in a lower-priority task.\\n\\nHeader :idf_file:`components/esp_system/include/esp_task.h` contains macros for the priority levels used for built-in ESP-IDF tasks system. See :ref:`freertos_system_tasks` for more details about the system tasks.\\n\\nCommon priorities are:\\n\\n..

For very short timing-critical operations that do not use the network, use an ISR or a very restricted task (with very short bursts of runtime only) at the highest priority (24). Choosing priority 19 allows lower-layer {IDF_TARGET_RF_TYPE} functionality to run without delays, but still preempts the lwIP TCP/IP stack and other less time-critical internal functionality - this is the best option for time-critical tasks that do not perform network operations. Any task that does TCP/IP network operations should run at a lower priority than the lwIP TCP/IP task (18) to avoid priority-inversion issues.\\n\\n.. only:: SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES\\n\\n    With a few exceptions, most importantly the lwIP TCP/IP task, in the default configuration most built-in tasks are pinned to Core 0. This makes it quite easy for the application to place high priority tasks on Core 1. Using priority 19 or higher guarantees that an application task can run on Core 1 without being preempted by any built-in task. To further isolate the tasks running on each CPU, configure the :ref:`lwIP task <CONFIG_LWIP_TCPIP_TASK_AFFINITY>` to only run on Core 0 instead of either core, which may reduce total TCP/IP throughput depending on what other tasks are running.\\n\\n    In general, it is not recommended to set task priorities on Core 0 higher than the built-in {IDF_TARGET_RF_TYPE} operations as starving them of CPU may make the system unstable. Choosing priority 19 and Core 0 allows lower-layer {IDF_TARGET_RF_TYPE} functionality to run without delays, but still pre-empts the lwIP TCP/IP stack and other less time-critical internal functionality. This is an option for time-critical tasks that do not perform network operations. Any task that does TCP/IP network operations should run at lower priority than the lwIP TCP/IP task (18) to avoid priority-inversion issues.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        Setting a task to always run in preference to built-in ESP-IDF tasks does not require pinning the task to Core 1. Instead, the task can be left unpinned and assigned a priority of 17 or lower. This allows the task to optionally run on Core 0 if there are no higher-priority built-in tasks running on that core. Using unpinned tasks can improve the overall CPU utilization, however it makes reasoning about task scheduling more complex.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Task execution is always completely suspended when writing to the built-in SPI flash chip. Only :ref:`iram-safe-interrupt-handlers` continues executing.\\n\\nImproving Interrupt Performance\\n-------------------------------\\n\\nESP-IDF supports dynamic :doc:`/api-reference/system/intr_alloc` with interrupt preemption. Each interrupt in the system has a priority, and higher-priority interrupts preempts lower priority ones.\\n\\nInterrupt handlers execute in preference to any task, provided the task is not inside a critical section. For this reason, it is important to minimize the amount of time spent in executing an interrupt handler.\\n\\nTo obtain the best performance for a particular interrupt handler:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - Assign more important interrupts a higher priority using a flag such as ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_LEVEL2`` or ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_LEVEL3`` when calling :cpp:func:`esp_intr_alloc`.\\n    :SOC_HP_CPU_HAS_MULTIPLE_CORES: - Assign the interrupt on a CPU where built-in {IDF_TARGET_RF_TYPE} tasks are not configured to run, which means assigning the interrupt on Core 1 by default, see :ref:`built-in-task-priorities`. Interrupts are assigned on the same CPU where the :cpp:func:`esp_intr_alloc` function call is made.\\n    - If you are sure the entire interrupt handler can run from IRAM (see :ref:`iram-safe-interrupt-handlers`) then set the ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_IRAM`` flag when calling :cpp:func:`esp_intr_alloc` to assign the interrupt. This prevents it being temporarily disabled if the application firmware writes to the internal SPI flash.\\n    - Even if the interrupt handler is not IRAM-safe, if it is going to be executed frequently then consider moving the handler function to IRAM anyhow. This minimizes the chance of a flash cache miss when the interrupt code is executed (see :ref:`speed-targeted-optimizations`). It is possible to do this without adding the ``ESP_INTR_FLAG_IRAM`` flag to mark the interrupt as IRAM-safe, if only part of the handler is guaranteed to be in IRAM.\\n\\n.. _improve-network-speed:\\n\\nImproving Network Speed\\n-----------------------\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    :SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED: * For Wi-Fi, see :ref:`How-to-improve-Wi-Fi-performance` and :ref:`wifi-buffer-usage`\\n    * For lwIP TCP/IP, see :ref:`lwip-performance`\\n    :SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED: * The :example:`wifi/iperf` example contains a configuration that is heavily optimized for Wi-Fi TCP/IP throughput, usually at the expense of higher RAM usage.

In these cases, it is necessary to tune the memory usage of the firmware application.\\n\\nIn general, firmware should aim to leave some headroom of free internal RAM to deal with extraordinary situations or changes in RAM usage in future updates.\\n\\nBackground\\n----------\\n\\nBefore optimizing ESP-IDF RAM usage, it is necessary to understand the basics of {IDF_TARGET_NAME} memory types, the difference between static and dynamic memory usage in C, and the way ESP-IDF uses stack and heap. This information can all be found in :doc:`/api-reference/system/mem_alloc`.\\n\\nMeasuring Static Memory Usage\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nThe :ref:`idf.py` tool can be used to generate reports about the static memory usage of an application, see :ref:`idf.py-size`.\\n\\nMeasuring Dynamic Memory Usage\\n------------------------------\\n\\nESP-IDF contains a range of heap APIs for measuring free heap at runtime, see :doc:`/api-reference/system/heap_debug`.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   In embedded systems, heap fragmentation can be a significant issue alongside total RAM usage. The heap measurement APIs provide ways to measure the largest free block. Monitoring this value along with the total number of free bytes can give a quick indication of whether heap fragmentation is becoming an issue.\\n\\nReducing Static Memory Usage\\n----------------------------\\n\\n- Reducing the static memory usage of the application increases the amount of RAM available for heap at runtime, and vice versa.\\n- Generally speaking, minimizing static memory usage requires monitoring the ``.data`` and ``.bss`` sizes. For tools to do this, see :ref:`idf.py-size`.\\n- Internal ESP-IDF functions do not make heavy use of static RAM in C. In many instances (such as {IDF_TARGET_STATIC_MEANS_HEAP}), static buffers are still allocated from the heap. However, the allocation is performed only once during feature initialization and will be freed if the feature is deinitialized. This approach is adopted to optimize the availability of free memory at various stages of the application\\'s life cycle.\\n\\nTo minimize static memory use:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n   - Constant data can be stored in flash memory instead of RAM, thus it is recommended to declare structures, buffers, or other variables as ``const``. This approach may require modifying firmware functions to accept ``const *`` arguments instead of mutable pointer arguments. These changes can also help reduce the stack usage of certain functions.\\n   :SOC_BT_SUPPORTED: - If using Bluedroid, setting the option :ref:`CONFIG_BT_BLE_DYNAMIC_ENV_MEMORY` will cause Bluedroid to allocate memory on initialization and free it on deinitialization. This does not necessarily reduce the peak memory usage, but changes it from static memory usage to runtime memory usage.\\n   - If using OpenThread, enabling the option :ref:`CONFIG_OPENTHREAD_PLATFORM_MSGPOOL_MANAGEMENT` will cause OpenThread to allocate message pool buffers from PSRAM, which will reduce static memory use.\\n\\n.. _optimize-stack-sizes:\\n\\nReducing Stack Sizes\\n--------------------\\n\\nIn FreeRTOS, task stacks are usually allocated from the heap. The stack size for each task is fixed and passed as an argument to :cpp:func:`xTaskCreate`. Each task can use up to its allocated stack size, but using more than this will cause an otherwise valid program to crash, with a stack overflow or heap corruption.\\n\\nTherefore, determining the optimum sizes of each task stack, minimizing the required size of each task stack, and minimizing the number of task stacks as whole, can all substantially reduce RAM usage.\\n\\nTo determine the optimum size for a particular task stack, users can consider the following methods:\\n\\n- At runtime, call the function :cpp:func:`uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark` with the handle of any task where you think there is unused stack memory. This function returns the minimum lifetime free stack memory in bytes.\\n\\n  - The easiest time to call :cpp:func:`uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark` is from the task itself: call ``uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark(NULL)`` to get the current task\\'s high water mark after the time that the task has achieved its peak stack usage, i.e., if there is a main loop, execute the main loop a number of times with all possible states, and then call :cpp:func:`uxTaskGetStackHighWaterMark`.\\n  - Often, it is possible to subtract almost the entire value returned here from the total stack size of a task, but allow some safety margin to account for unexpected small increases in stack usage at runtime.\\n\\n- Call :cpp:func:`uxTaskGetSystemState` at runtime to get a summary of all tasks in the system. This includes their individual stack high watermark values.\\n- When debugger watchpoints are not being used, users can set the :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_WATCHPOINT_END_OF_STACK` option. This will cause one of the watchpoints to watch the last word of the task\\'s stack. If that word is overwritten (such as in a stack overflow), a panic is triggered immediately. This is slightly more reliable than the default :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_CHECK_STACKOVERFLOW` option of ``Check using canary bytes``, because the panic happens immediately, rather than on the next RTOS context switch. Neither option is perfect. In some cases, it is possible that the stack pointer skips the watchpoint or canary bytes and corrupts another region of RAM instead.\\n\\nTo reduce the required size of a particular task stack, users can consider the following methods:\\n\\n- Avoid stack heavy functions. String formatting functions (like ``printf()``) are particularly heavy users of the stack, so any task which does not ever call these can usually have its stack size reduced.\\n\\n  - Enabling :ref:`newlib-nano-formatting` reduces the stack usage of any task that calls ``printf()`` or other C string formatting functions.\\n\\n- Avoid allocating large variables on the stack. In C, any large structures or arrays allocated as an automatic variable (i.e., default scope of a C declaration) uses space on the stack. To minimize the sizes of these, allocate them statically and/or see if you can save memory by dynamically allocating them from the heap only when they are needed.\\n- Avoid deep recursive function calls. Individual recursive function calls do not always add a lot of stack usage each time they are called, but if each function includes large stack-based variables then the overhead can get quite high.\\n\\nTo reduce the total number of tasks, users can consider the following method:\\n\\n- Combine tasks. If a particular task is never created, the task\\'s stack is never allocated, thus reducing RAM usage significantly. Unnecessary tasks can typically be removed if those tasks can be combined with another task. In an application, tasks can typically be combined or removed if:\\n\\n   - The work done by the tasks can be structured into multiple functions that are called sequentially.\\n   - The work done by the tasks can be structured into smaller jobs that are serialized (via a FreeRTOS queue or similar) for execution by a worker task.\\n\\nInternal Task Stack Sizes\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nESP-IDF allocates a number of internal tasks for housekeeping purposes or operating system functions. Some are created during the startup process, and some are created at runtime when particular features are initialized.\\n\\nThe default stack sizes for these tasks are usually set conservatively high to allow all common usage patterns. Many of the stack sizes are configurable, and it may be possible to reduce them to match the real runtime stack usage of the task.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n   If internal task stack sizes are set too small, ESP-IDF will crash unpredictably. Even if the root cause is task stack overflow, this is not always clear when debugging. It is recommended that internal stack sizes are only reduced carefully (if at all), with close attention to high water mark free space under load. If reporting an issue that occurs when internal task stack sizes have been reduced, please always include the following information and the specific configuration that is being used.\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n   - :ref:`app-main-task` has stack size :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_MAIN_TASK_STACK_SIZE`.\\n   - :doc:`/api-reference/system/esp_timer` system task which executes callbacks has stack size :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_TIMER_TASK_STACK_SIZE`.\\n   - FreeRTOS Timer Task to handle FreeRTOS timer callbacks has stack size :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_TIMER_TASK_STACK_DEPTH`.\\n   - :doc:`/api-reference/system/esp_event` system task to execute callbacks for the default system event loop has stack size :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_EVENT_TASK_STACK_SIZE`.\\n   - :doc:`/api-guides/lwip` TCP/IP task has stack size :ref:`CONFIG_LWIP_TCPIP_TASK_STACK_SIZE`.\\n   :SOC_BT_SUPPORTED: - :doc:`/api-reference/bluetooth/index` have task stack sizes :ref:`CONFIG_BT_BTC_TASK_STACK_SIZE`, :ref:`CONFIG_BT_BTU_TASK_STACK_SIZE`.\\n   :SOC_BT_SUPPORTED: - :doc:`/api-reference/bluetooth/nimble/index` has task stack size :ref:`CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_HOST_TASK_STACK_SIZE`.\\n   - The Ethernet driver creates a task for the MAC to receive Ethernet frames. If using the default config ``ETH_MAC_DEFAULT_CONFIG`` then the task stack size is 4 KB. This setting can be changed by passing a custom :cpp:class:`eth_mac_config_t` struct when initializing the Ethernet MAC.\\n   - FreeRTOS idle task stack size is configured by :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_IDLE_TASK_STACKSIZE`.\\n   - If using the :doc:`/api-reference/protocols/mqtt` component, it creates a task with stack size configured by :ref:`CONFIG_MQTT_TASK_STACK_SIZE`. MQTT stack size can also be configured using ``task_stack`` field of :cpp:class:`esp_mqtt_client_config_t`.\\n   - To see how to optimize RAM usage when using ``mDNS``, please check `Minimizing RAM Usage <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-protocols/mdns/docs/latest/en/index.html#minimizing-ram-usage>`__.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   Aside from built-in system features such as ESP-timer, if an ESP-IDF feature is not initialized by the firmware, then no associated task is created. In those cases, the stack usage is zero, and the stack-size configuration for the task is not relevant.\\n\\nReducing Heap Usage\\n-------------------\\n\\nFor functions that assist in analyzing heap usage at runtime, see :doc:`/api-reference/system/heap_debug`.\\n\\nNormally, optimizing heap usage consists of analyzing the usage and removing calls to ``malloc()`` that are not being used, reducing the corresponding sizes, or freeing previously allocated buffers earlier.\\n\\nThere are some ESP-IDF configuration options that can reduce heap usage at runtime:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n   - lwIP documentation has a section to configure :ref:`lwip-ram-usage`.\\n   :SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED: - :ref:`wifi-buffer-usage` describes options to either reduce the number of static buffers or reduce the maximum number of dynamic buffers in use, so as to minimize memory usage at a possible cost of performance. Note that static Wi-Fi buffers are still allocated from the heap when Wi-Fi is initialized, and will be freed if Wi-Fi is deinitialized.\\n   :esp32: - The Ethernet driver allocates DMA buffers for the internal Ethernet MAC when it is initialized - configuration options are :ref:`CONFIG_ETH_DMA_BUFFER_SIZE`, :ref:`CONFIG_ETH_DMA_RX_BUFFER_NUM`, :ref:`CONFIG_ETH_DMA_TX_BUFFER_NUM`.\\n   - Several Mbed TLS configuration options can be used to reduce heap memory usage. See the :ref:`reducing_ram_usage_mbedtls` docs for details.\\n   :esp32: - In single-core mode only, it is possible to use IRAM as byte-accessible memory added to the regular heap by enabling :ref:`CONFIG_ESP32_IRAM_AS_8BIT_ACCESSIBLE_MEMORY`. Note that this option carries a performance penalty, and the risk of security issues caused by executable data. If this option is enabled, then it is possible to set other options to prefer certain buffers allocated from this memory: :ref:`CONFIG_MBEDTLS_MEM_ALLOC_MODE`, :ref:`NimBLE <CONFIG_BT_NIMBLE_MEM_ALLOC_MODE>`.\\n   :esp32: - Reduce :ref:`CONFIG_BTDM_CTRL_BLE_MAX_CONN` if using Bluetooth LE.\\n   :esp32: - Reduce :ref:`CONFIG_BTDM_CTRL_BR_EDR_MAX_ACL_CONN` if using Bluetooth Classic.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   There are other configuration options that increases heap usage at runtime if changed from the defaults. These options are not listed above, but the help text for the configuration item will mention if there is some memory impact.\\n\\n.. _optimize-iram-usage:\\n\\nOptimizing IRAM Usage\\n---------------------\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32\\n\\n   The available DRAM at runtime for heap usage is also reduced by the static IRAM usage. Therefore, one way to increase available DRAM is to reduce IRAM usage.\\n\\nIf the app allocates more static IRAM than available, then the app will fail to build, and linker errors such as ``section \\'.iram0.text\\' will not fit in region \\'iram0_0_seg\\'``, ``IRAM0 segment data does not fit``, and ``region \\'iram0_0_seg\\' overflowed by 84-bytes`` will be seen. If this happens, it is necessary to find ways to reduce static IRAM usage in order to link the application.\\n\\nTo analyze the IRAM usage in the firmware binary, use :ref:`idf.py-size`. If the firmware failed to link, steps to analyze are shown at :ref:`idf-size-linker-failed`.\\n\\nThe following options will reduce IRAM usage of some ESP-IDF features:\\n\\n.. list::\\n\\n    - Enable :ref:`CONFIG_FREERTOS_PLACE_FUNCTIONS_INTO_FLASH`. Provided these functions are not incorrectly used from ISRs, this option is safe to enable in all configurations.\\n    - Enable :ref:`CONFIG_RINGBUF_PLACE_FUNCTIONS_INTO_FLASH`. Provided these functions are not incorrectly used from ISRs, this option is safe to enable in all configurations.\\n    - Enable :ref:`CONFIG_RINGBUF_PLACE_ISR_FUNCTIONS_INTO_FLASH`. This option is not safe to use if the ISR ringbuf functions are used from an IRAM interrupt context, e.g., if :ref:`CONFIG_UART_ISR_IN_IRAM` is enabled. For the ESP-IDF drivers where this is the case, you can get an error at run-time when installing the driver in question.\\n    :SOC_WIFI_SUPPORTED: - Disabling Wi-Fi options :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_IRAM_OPT` and/or :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_RX_IRAM_OPT` options frees available IRAM at the cost of Wi-Fi performance.\\n    :CONFIG_ESP_ROM_HAS_SPI_FLASH: - Enabling :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_ROM_IMPL` frees some IRAM but means that esp_flash bugfixes and new flash chip support are not available, see :doc:`/api-reference/peripherals/spi_flash/spi_flash_idf_vs_rom` for details.\\n    :esp32: - Disabling :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_ROM_DRIVER_PATCH` frees some IRAM but is only available in some flash configurations, see the configuration item help text.\\n    :esp32: - If the application uses PSRAM and is based on ESP32 rev. 3 (ECO3), setting :ref:`CONFIG_ESP32_REV_MIN` to ``3`` disables PSRAM bug workarounds, saving 10 KB or more of IRAM.\\n    - Disabling :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_EVENT_POST_FROM_IRAM_ISR` prevents posting ``esp_event`` events from :ref:`iram-safe-interrupt-handlers` but saves some IRAM.\\n    - Disabling :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_ISR_IN_IRAM` prevents spi_master interrupts from being serviced while writing to flash, and may otherwise reduce spi_master performance, but saves some IRAM.\\n    - Disabling :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_SLAVE_ISR_IN_IRAM` prevents spi_slave interrupts from being serviced while writing to flash, which saves some IRAM.\\n    - Setting :ref:`CONFIG_HAL_DEFAULT_ASSERTION_LEVEL` to disable assertion for HAL component saves some IRAM, especially for HAL code who calls ``HAL_ASSERT`` a lot and resides in IRAM.\\n    - Refer to the sdkconfig menu ``Auto-detect Flash chips``, and you can disable flash drivers which you do not need to save some IRAM.\\n    - Enable :ref:`CONFIG_HEAP_PLACE_FUNCTION_INTO_FLASH`. Provided that :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_ISR_IN_IRAM` is not enabled and the heap functions are not incorrectly used from ISRs, this option is safe to enable in all configurations.\\n    :esp32c2: - Enable :ref:`CONFIG_BT_RELEASE_IRAM`. Release BT text section and merge BT data, bss & text into a large free heap region when ``esp_bt_mem_release`` is called. This makes Bluetooth unavailable until the next restart, but saving ~22 KB or more of IRAM.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32\\n\\n   Using SRAM1 for IRAM\\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n   The SRAM1 memory area is normally used for DRAM, but it is possible to use parts of it for IRAM with :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_ESP32_SRAM1_REGION_AS_IRAM`. This memory would previously be reserved for DRAM data usage (e.g., ``.bss``) by the software bootloader and later added to the heap. After this option was introduced, the bootloader DRAM size was reduced to a value closer to what it normally actually needs.\\n\\n   To use this option, ESP-IDF should be able to recognize that the new SRAM1 area is also a valid load address for an image segment. If the software bootloader was compiled before this option existed, then the bootloader will not be able to load the app that has code placed in this new extended IRAM area. This would typically happen if you are doing an OTA update, where only the app would be updated.\\n\\n   If the IRAM section were to be placed in an invalid area, then this would be detected during the bootup process, and result in a failed boot:\\n\\n   .. code-block:: text\\n\\n      E (204) esp_image: Segment 5 0x400845f8-0x400a126c invalid: bad load address range\\n\\n   .. warning::\\n\\n      Apps compiled with :ref:`CONFIG_ESP_SYSTEM_ESP32_SRAM1_REGION_AS_IRAM` may fail to boot, if used together with a software bootloader that was compiled before this config option was introduced. If you are using an older bootloader and updating over OTA, please test carefully before pushing any updates.\\n\\n   Any memory that ends up unused for static IRAM will be added to the heap.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c3\\n\\n    Flash Suspend Feature\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    When using SPI flash driver API and other APIs based on the former (NVS, Partition APIs, etc.), the Cache will be disabled. During this period, any code executed must reside in internal RAM, see :ref:`concurrency-constraints-flash`. Hence, interrupt handlers that are not in internal RAM will not be executed.\\n\\n    To achieve this, ESP-IDF drivers usually have the following two options:\\n\\n    - Place the driver\\'s internal ISR handler in the internal RAM.\\n    - Place some control functions in the internal RAM.\\n\\n    User ISR callbacks and involved variables have to be in internal RAM if they are also used in interrupt contexts.\\n\\n    Placing additional code into IRAM will exacerbate IRAM usage. For this reason, there is :ref:`CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_AUTO_SUSPEND`, which can alleviate the aforementioned kinds of IRAM usage. By enabling this feature, the Cache will not be disabled when SPI flash driver APIs and SPI flash driver-based APIs are used. Therefore, code and data in flash can be executed or accessed normally, but with some minor delay.

For most applications, it is safe to move many of the C library functions into flash, reclaiming some IRAM. Corresponding options include:\\n\\n    .. list::\\n\\n        - :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_LIBJMP_IN_IRAM`: affects the functions ``longjmp`` and ``setjump``.\\n        - :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_LIBMATH_IN_IRAM`: affects the functions ``abs``, ``div``, ``labs``, ``ldiv``, ``quorem``, ``fpclassify`` and ``nan``.\\n        - :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_LIBNUMPARSER_IN_IRAM`: affects the functions ``utoa``, ``itoa``, ``atoi``, ``atol``, ``strtol``, and ``strtoul``.\\n        - :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_LIBIO_IN_IRAM`: affects the functions ``wcrtomb``, ``fvwrite``, ``wbuf``, ``wsetup``, ``fputwc``, ``wctomb_r``, ``ungetc``, ``makebuf``, ``fflush``, ``refill``, and ``sccl``.\\n        - :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_LIBTIME_IN_IRAM`: affects the functions ``asctime``, ``asctime_r``, ``ctime``, ``ctime_r``, ``lcltime``, ``lcltime_r``, ``gmtime``, ``gmtime_r``, ``strftime``, ``mktime``, ``tzset_r``, ``tzset``, ``time``, ``gettzinfo``, ``systimes``, ``month_lengths``, ``timelocal``, ``tzvars``, ``tzlock``, ``tzcalc_limits``, and ``strptime``.\\n        - :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_LIBCHAR_IN_IRAM`: affects the functions ``ctype_``, ``toupper``, ``tolower``, ``toascii``, ``strupr``, ``bzero``, ``isalnum``, ``isalpha``, ``isascii``, ``isblank``, ``iscntrl``, ``isdigit``, ``isgraph``, ``islower``, ``isprint``, ``ispunct``, ``isspace``, and ``isupper``.\\n        - :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_LIBMEM_IN_IRAM`: affects the functions ``memccpy``, ``memchr``, ``memmove``, and ``memrchr``.\\n        - :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_LIBSTR_IN_IRAM`: affects the functions ``strcasecmp``, ``strcasestr``, ``strchr``, ``strcoll``, ``strcpy``, ``strcspn``, ``strdup``, ``strdup_r``, ``strlcat``, ``strlcpy``, ``strlen``, ``strlwr``, ``strncasecmp``, ``strncat``, ``strncmp``, ``strncpy``, ``strndup``, ``strndup_r``, ``strrchr``, ``strsep``, ``strspn``, ``strstr``, ``strtok_r, and ``strupr``.\\n        - :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_LIBRAND_IN_IRAM`: affects the functions ``srand``, ``rand``, and ``rand_r``.\\n        - :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_LIBENV_IN_IRAM`: affects the functions ``environ``, ``envlock``, and ``getenv_r``.\\n        - :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_LIBFILE_IN_IRAM`: affects the functions ``lock``, ``isatty``, ``fclose``, ``open``, ``close``, ``creat``, ``read``, ``rshift``, ``sbrk``, ``stdio``, ``syssbrk``, ``sysclose``, ``sysopen``, ``creat``, ``sysread``, ``syswrite``, ``impure``, ``fwalk``, and ``findfp``.\\n        - :ref:`CONFIG_SPIRAM_CACHE_LIBMISC_IN_IRAM`: affects the functions ``raise`` and ``system``.\\n\\n    The exact amount of IRAM saved will depend on how much C library code is actually used by the application. In addition, the following options may be used to move more of the C library code into flash, however note that this may result in reduced performance. Be careful not to use the C library function allocated with :c:macro:`ESP_INTR_FLAG_IRAM` flag from interrupts when cache is disabled, refer to :ref:`iram-safe-interrupt-handlers` for more details. For these reasons, the functions ``itoa``, ``memcmp``, ``memcpy``, ``memset``, ``strcat``, ``strcmp``, and ``strlen`` are always put in IRAM.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Moving frequently-called functions from IRAM to flash may increase their execution time.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    Other configuration options exist that will increase IRAM usage by moving some functionality into IRAM, usually for performance, but the default option is not to do this. These are not listed here. The IRAM size impact of enabling these options is usually noted in the configuration item help text.\\n',\n",

The installer downloads only necessary dependencies including `Git For Windows`_  during the installation process. The installer stores downloaded files in the cache directory ``%userprofile%\\\\.espressif``\\n\\nOffline Installer does not require any network connection. The installer contains all required dependencies including `Git For Windows`_ .\\n\\nComponents of the Installation\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe installer deploys the following components:\\n\\n- Embedded Python\\n- Cross-compilers\\n- OpenOCD\\n- CMake_ and Ninja_ build tools\\n- ESP-IDF\\n\\nThe installer also allows reusing the existing directory with ESP-IDF. The recommended directory is ``%userprofile%\\\\Desktop\\\\esp-idf`` where ``%userprofile%`` is your home directory.\\n\\nLaunching ESP-IDF Environment\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nAt the end of the installation process you can check out option ``Run ESP-IDF PowerShell Environment`` or ``Run ESP-IDF Command Prompt (cmd.exe)``. The installer launches ESP-IDF environment in selected prompt.\\n\\n``Run ESP-IDF PowerShell Environment``:\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/esp-idf-installer-screenshot-powershell.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Completing the ESP-IDF Tools Setup Wizard with Run ESP-IDF PowerShell Environment\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Completing the ESP-IDF Tools Setup Wizard with Run ESP-IDF PowerShell Environment\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/esp-idf-installer-powershell.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: ESP-IDF PowerShell\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-IDF PowerShell\\n\\n``Run ESP-IDF Command Prompt (cmd.exe)``:\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/esp-idf-installer-screenshot.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Completing the ESP-IDF Tools Setup Wizard with Run ESP-IDF Command Prompt (cmd.exe)\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Completing the ESP-IDF Tools Setup Wizard with Run ESP-IDF Command Prompt (cmd.exe)\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/esp-idf-installer-command-prompt.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: ESP-IDF Command Prompt\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-IDF Command Prompt\\n\\nUsing the Command Prompt\\n========================\\n\\nFor the remaining Getting Started steps, we are going to use the Windows Command Prompt.\\n\\nESP-IDF Tools Installer also creates a shortcut in the Start menu to launch the ESP-IDF Command Prompt. This shortcut launches the Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and runs ``export.bat`` script to set up the environment variables (``PATH``, ``IDF_PATH`` and others). Inside this command prompt, all the installed tools are available.\\n\\nNote that this shortcut is specific to the ESP-IDF directory selected in the ESP-IDF Tools Installer. If you have multiple ESP-IDF directories on the computer (for example, to work with different versions of ESP-IDF), you have two options to use them:\\n\\n1. Create a copy of the shortcut created by the ESP-IDF Tools Installer, and change the working directory of the new shortcut to the ESP-IDF directory you wish to use.\\n\\n2. Alternatively, run ``cmd.exe``, then change to the ESP-IDF directory you wish to use, and run ``export.bat``. Note that unlike the previous option, this way requires Python and Git to be present in ``PATH``. If you get errors related to Python or Git not being found, use the first option.\\n\\nFirst Steps on ESP-IDF\\n======================\\n\\n.. _get-started-windows-first-steps:\\n\\n.. include:: windows-start-project.rst\\n.. include:: start-project.rst\\n\\nRelated Documents\\n=================\\n\\nFor advanced users who want to customize the install process:\\n\\n* :doc:`windows-setup-update`\\n* :doc:`establish-serial-connection`\\n* `Eclipse Plugin <https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/README.md>`_\\n* `VSCode Extension <https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/blob/master/docs/tutorial/install.md>`_\\n* :doc:`../api-guides/tools/idf-monitor`\\n\\n.. toctree::\\n    :hidden:\\n    :maxdepth: 1\\n\\n    windows-setup-update\\n    establish-serial-connection\\n    flashing-troubleshooting\\n\\n.. _CMake: https://cmake.org/download/\\n.. _Ninja: https://ninja-build.org/\\n.. _Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/\\n.. _Git for Windows: https://gitforwindows.org/\\n.. _Github Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/\\n',\n",

Install Prerequisites\\n=============================\\n\\nIn order to use ESP-IDF with the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, you need to install some software packages based on your Operating System. This setup guide helps you on getting everything installed on Linux and macOS based systems.\\n\\nFor Linux Users\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nTo compile using ESP-IDF, you need to get the following packages. The command to run depends on which distribution of Linux you are using:\\n\\n- Ubuntu and Debian::\\n\\n    sudo apt-get install git wget flex bison gperf python3 python3-pip python3-venv cmake ninja-build ccache libffi-dev libssl-dev dfu-util libusb-1.0-0\\n\\n- CentOS 7 & 8::\\n\\n    sudo yum -y update && sudo yum install git wget flex bison gperf python3 cmake ninja-build ccache dfu-util libusbx\\n\\nCentOS 7 is still supported but CentOS version 8 is recommended for a better user experience.\\n\\n- Arch::\\n\\n    sudo pacman -S --needed gcc git make flex bison gperf python cmake ninja ccache dfu-util libusb\\n\\n.. note::\\n    - CMake version 3.16 or newer is required for use with ESP-IDF. Run \"tools/idf_tools.py install cmake\" to install a suitable version if your OS versions does not have one.\\n    - If you do not see your Linux distribution in the above list then please check its documentation to find out which command to use for package installation.\\n\\nFor macOS Users\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nESP-IDF uses the version of Python installed by default on macOS.\\n\\n- Install CMake & Ninja build:\\n\\n  - If you have HomeBrew_, you can run::\\n\\n      brew install cmake ninja dfu-util\\n\\n  - If you have MacPorts_, you can run::\\n\\n      sudo port install cmake ninja dfu-util\\n\\n  - Otherwise, consult the CMake_ and Ninja_ home pages for macOS installation downloads.\\n\\n- It is strongly recommended to also install ccache_ for faster builds. If you have HomeBrew_, this can be done via ``brew install ccache`` or ``sudo port install ccache`` on MacPorts_.\\n\\n.. note::\\n   If an error like this is shown during any step::\\n\\n     xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun\\n\\n   Then you need to install the XCode command line tools to continue. You can install these by running ``xcode-select --install``.\\n\\nApple M1 Users\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIf you use Apple M1 platform and see an error like this::\\n\\n      WARNING: directory for tool xtensa-esp32-elf version esp-2021r2-patch3-8.4.0 is present, but tool was not found\\n      ERROR: tool xtensa-esp32-elf has no installed versions. Please run \\'install.sh\\' to install it.\\n\\nor::\\n\\n      zsh: bad CPU type in executable: ~/.espressif/tools/xtensa-esp32-elf/esp-2021r2-patch3-8.4.0/xtensa-esp32-elf/bin/xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc\\n\\nThen you need to install Apple Rosetta 2 by running\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    /usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license\\n\\n\\nInstalling Python 3\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nBased on macOS `Catalina 10.15 release notes`_, use of Python 2.7 is not recommended and Python 2.7 is not included by default in future versions of macOS. Check what Python you currently have::\\n\\n  python --version\\n\\nIf the output is like ``Python 2.7.17``, your default interpreter is Python 2.7. If so, also check if Python 3 is not already installed on your computer::\\n\\n  python3 --version\\n\\nIf the above command returns an error, it means Python 3 is not installed.\\n\\nBelow is an overview of the steps to install Python 3.\\n\\n  - Installing with HomeBrew_ can be done as follows::\\n\\n      brew install python3\\n\\n  - If you have MacPorts_, you can run::\\n\\n      sudo port install python38\\n\\n.. _get-started-get-esp-idf:\\n\\nStep 2. Get ESP-IDF\\n===================\\n\\nTo build applications for the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, you need the software libraries provided by Espressif in `ESP-IDF repository <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf>`_.\\n\\nTo get ESP-IDF, navigate to your installation directory and clone the repository with ``git clone``, following instructions below specific to your operating system.\\n\\nOpen Terminal, and run the following commands:\\n\\n.. include-build-file:: inc/git-clone-bash.inc\\n\\nESP-IDF is downloaded into ``~/esp/esp-idf``.\\n\\nConsult :doc:`/versions` for information about which ESP-IDF version to use in a given situation.\\n\\n.. _get-started-set-up-tools:\\n\\nStep 3. Set up the Tools\\n========================\\n\\nAside from the ESP-IDF, you also need to install the tools used by ESP-IDF, such as the compiler, debugger, Python packages, etc, for projects supporting {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    cd ~/esp/esp-idf\\n    ./install.sh {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}\\n\\nor with Fish shell\\n\\n.. code-block:: fish\\n\\n    cd ~/esp/esp-idf\\n    ./install.fish {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}\\n\\nThe above commands install tools for {IDF_TARGET_NAME} only. If you intend to develop projects for more chip targets then you should list all of them and run for example:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    cd ~/esp/esp-idf\\n    ./install.sh esp32,esp32s2\\n\\nor with Fish shell\\n\\n.. code-block:: fish\\n\\n    cd ~/esp/esp-idf\\n    ./install.fish esp32,esp32s2\\n\\nIn order to install tools for all supported targets please run the following command:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    cd ~/esp/esp-idf\\n    ./install.sh all\\n\\nor with Fish shell\\n\\n.. code-block:: fish\\n\\n    cd ~/esp/esp-idf\\n    ./install.fish all\\n\\n.. note::\\n   For macOS users, if an error like this is shown during any step::\\n\\n     <urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: unable to get local issuer certificate (_ssl.c:xxx)\\n\\n   You may run ``Install Certificates.command`` in the Python folder of your computer to install certificates. For details, see `Download Error While Installing ESP-IDF Tools <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/4775>`_.\\n\\nAlternative File Downloads\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe tools installer downloads a number of files attached to GitHub Releases. If accessing GitHub is slow then it is possible to set an environment variable to prefer Espressif\\'s download server for GitHub asset downloads.\\n\\n.. note:: This setting only controls individual tools downloaded from GitHub releases, it does not change the URLs used to access any Git repositories.\\n\\nTo prefer the Espressif download server when installing tools, use the following sequence of commands when running ``install.sh``:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    cd ~/esp/esp-idf\\n    export IDF_GITHUB_ASSETS=\"dl.espressif.com/github_assets\"\\n    ./install.sh\\n\\n.. note::\\n    For users in China, we recommend using our download server located in China for faster download speed.\\n\\n    .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n        cd ~/esp/esp-idf\\n        export IDF_GITHUB_ASSETS=\"dl.espressif.cn/github_assets\"\\n        ./install.sh\\n\\nCustomizing the Tools Installation Path\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nThe scripts introduced in this step install compilation tools required by ESP-IDF inside the user home directory: ``$HOME/.espressif`` on Linux. If you wish to install the tools into a different directory, **export the environment variable IDF_TOOLS_PATH before running the installation scripts**. Make sure that your user account has sufficient permissions to read and write this path.\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    export IDF_TOOLS_PATH=\"$HOME/required_idf_tools_path\"\\n    ./install.sh\\n\\n    . ./export.sh\\n\\nIf changing the ``IDF_TOOLS_PATH``, make sure it is exported in the environment before running any ESP-IDF tools or scripts.\\n\\n.. note::\\n    Using ``IDF_TOOLS_PATH`` in variable assignement, e.g., ``IDF_TOOLS_PATH=\"$HOME/required_idf_tools_path\" ./install.sh``, without prior exporting, will not work in most shells because the variable assignment will not affect the current execution environment, even if it\\'s exported/changed in the sourced script.\\n\\n.. _get-started-set-up-env:\\n\\nStep 4. Set up the Environment Variables\\n========================================\\n\\nThe installed tools are not yet added to the PATH environment variable. To make the tools usable from the command line, some environment variables must be set. ESP-IDF provides another script which does that.\\n\\nIn the terminal where you are going to use ESP-IDF, run:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    . $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh\\n\\nor for fish (supported only since fish version 3.0.0):\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    . $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.fish\\n\\nNote the space between the leading dot and the path!\\n\\nIf you plan to use esp-idf frequently, you can create an alias for executing ``export.sh``:\\n\\n1.  Copy and paste the following command to your shell\\'s profile (``.profile``, ``.bashrc``, ``.zprofile``, etc.)\\n\\n    .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n        alias get_idf=\\'. $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh\\'\\n\\n2.  Refresh the configuration by restarting the terminal session or by running ``source [path to profile]``, for example, ``source ~/.bashrc``.\\n\\nNow you can run ``get_idf`` to set up or refresh the esp-idf environment in any terminal session.\\n\\nTechnically, you can add ``export.sh`` to your shell\\'s profile directly; however, it is not recommended. Doing so activates IDF virtual environment in every terminal session (including those where IDF is not needed), defeating the purpose of the virtual environment and likely affecting other software.\\n\\n.. _get-started-start-a-project:\\n.. _get-started-build:\\n.. _get-started-configure:\\n.. _get-started-connect:\\n.. _get-started-linux-macos-first-steps:\\n\\nStep 5. First Steps on ESP-IDF\\n==============================\\n\\n.. include:: linux-macos-start-project.rst\\n.. include:: start-project.rst\\n\\nTip: Updating ESP-IDF\\n======================\\n\\nIt is recommended to update ESP-IDF from time to time, as newer versions fix bugs and/or provide new features. Please note that each ESP-IDF major and minor release version has an associated support period, and when one release branch is approaching end of life (EOL), all users are encouraged to upgrade their projects to more recent ESP-IDF releases, to find out more about support periods, see :doc:`ESP-IDF Versions <../versions>`.\\n\\nThe simplest way to do the update is to delete the existing ``esp-idf`` folder and clone it again, as if performing the initial installation described in :ref:`get-started-get-esp-idf`.\\n\\nAnother solution is to update only what has changed. :ref:`The update procedure depends on the version of ESP-IDF you are using <updating>`.\\n\\nAfter updating ESP-IDF, execute the Install script again, in case the new ESP-IDF version requires different versions of tools. See instructions at :ref:`get-started-set-up-tools`.\\n\\nOnce the new tools are installed, update the environment using the Export script.

See the \"Additional Tips\" below. You can also refer to :doc:`flashing-troubleshooting` page or :doc:`establish-serial-connection` for more detailed information.\\n\\nNormal Operation\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nWhen flashing, you will see the output log similar to the following:\\n\\n.. include:: {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME}_output_log.inc\\n   :start-after: output_log\\n\\nIf there are no issues by the end of the flash process, the board will reboot and start up the \"hello_world\" application.\\n\\nIf you would like to use the Eclipse or VS Code IDE instead of running ``idf.py``, check out `Eclipse Plugin <https://github.com/espressif/idf-eclipse-plugin/blob/master/README.md>`_, `VSCode Extension <https://github.com/espressif/vscode-esp-idf-extension/blob/master/docs/tutorial/install.md>`_.\\n\\nMonitor the Output\\n==================\\n\\nTo check if \"hello_world\" is indeed running, type ``idf.py -p PORT monitor`` (Do not forget to replace PORT with your serial port name).\\n\\nThis command launches the :doc:`IDF Monitor <../api-guides/tools/idf-monitor>` application::\\n\\n    $ idf.py -p <PORT> monitor\\n    Running idf_monitor in directory [...]/esp/hello_world/build\\n    Executing \"python [...]/esp-idf/tools/idf_monitor.py -b 115200 [...]/esp/hello_world/build/hello_world.elf\"...\\n    --- idf_monitor on <PORT> 115200 ---\\n    --- Quit: Ctrl+] | Menu: Ctrl+T | Help: Ctrl+T followed by Ctrl+H ---\\n    ets Jun  8 2016 00:22:57\\n\\n    rst:0x1 (POWERON_RESET),boot:0x13 (SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)\\n    ets Jun  8 2016 00:22:57\\n    ...\\n\\nAfter startup and diagnostic logs scroll up, you should see \"Hello world!\" printed out by the application.\\n\\n.. code-block:: none\\n\\n        ...\\n        Hello world!\\n        Restarting in 10 seconds...\\n        This is {IDF_TARGET_PATH_NAME} chip with {IDF_TARGET_SOC_CPU_CORES_NUM} CPU core(s), {IDF_TARGET_FEATURES}\\n    Minimum free heap size: {IDF_TARGET_HEAP_SIZE} bytes\\n        Restarting in 9 seconds...\\n        Restarting in 8 seconds...\\n        Restarting in 7 seconds...\\n\\nTo exit IDF monitor use the shortcut ``Ctrl+]``.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32c2\\n\\n    If IDF monitor fails shortly after the upload, or, if instead of the messages above, you see random garbage similar to what is given below, your board is likely using a 26 MHz crystal. Most development board designs use 40 MHz, so ESP-IDF uses this frequency as a default value.\\n\\n    .. figure:: ../../_static/get-started-garbled-output.png\\n        :align: center\\n        :alt: Garbled output\\n        :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    If you have such a problem, do the following:\\n\\n    1. Exit the monitor.\\n    2. Go back to ``menuconfig``.\\n    3. Go to ``Component config`` --> ``Hardware Settings`` --> ``Main XTAL Config`` --> ``Main XTAL frequency``, then change :ref:`CONFIG_XTAL_FREQ_SEL` to 26 MHz.\\n    4. After that, ``build and flash`` the application again.\\n\\n    In the current version of ESP-IDF, main XTAL frequencies supported by {IDF_TARGET_NAME} are as follows:\\n\\n    .. list::\\n\\n        :SOC_XTAL_SUPPORT_24M: - 24 MHz\\n        :SOC_XTAL_SUPPORT_26M: - 26 MHz\\n        :SOC_XTAL_SUPPORT_32M: - 32 MHz\\n        :SOC_XTAL_SUPPORT_40M: - 40 MHz\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    You can combine building, flashing and monitoring into one step by running::\\n\\n        idf.py -p PORT flash monitor\\n\\nSee also:\\n\\n- :doc:`IDF Monitor <../api-guides/tools/idf-monitor>` for handy shortcuts and more details on using IDF monitor.\\n- :ref:`idf.py` for a full reference of ``idf.py`` commands and options.\\n\\n**That is all that you need to get started with {IDF_TARGET_NAME}!**\\n\\nNow you are ready to try some other :idf:`examples`, or go straight to developing your own applications.\\n\\n.. important::\\n\\n    Some of examples do not support {IDF_TARGET_NAME} because required hardware is not included in {IDF_TARGET_NAME} so it cannot be supported.\\n\\n    If building an example, please check the README file for the ``Supported Targets`` table. If this is present including {IDF_TARGET_NAME} target, or the table does not exist at all, the example will work on {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Tips\\n===============\\n\\nPermission Denied Issue\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nWith some Linux distributions, you may get the error message similar to ``Could not open port <PORT>: Permission denied: \\'<PORT>\\'`` when flashing the {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. :ref:`This can be solved by adding the current user to the specific group <linux-dialout-group>`, such as ``dialout`` or ``uucp`` group.\\n\\nPython Compatibility\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nESP-IDF supports Python 3.8 or newer. It is recommended to upgrade your operating system to a recent version satisfying this requirement. Other options include the installation of Python from `sources <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ or the use of a Python version management system such as `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32 or esp32s2 or esp32s3\\n\\n    ..\\n        When adding new targets to the line above, please update this list in windows-start-project.rst and linux-macos-start-project.rst\\n\\n\\n    Start with Board Support Package\\n    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\n    To speed up prototyping on some development boards, you can use `Board Support Packages (BSPs) <https://github.com/espressif/esp-bsp>`_, which makes initialization of a particular board as easy as few function calls.\\n\\n    A BSP typically supports all of the hardware components provided on development board. Apart from the pinout definition and initialization functions, a BSP ships with drivers for the external components such as sensors, displays, audio codecs etc.\\n\\n    The BSPs are distributed via :doc:`IDF Component Manager </api-guides/tools/idf-component-manager>`, so they can be found in `IDF Component Registry <https://components.espressif.com>`_.\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32\\n\\n        **Here is an example of how to add ESP-WROVER-KIT BSP to your project:**\\n\\n        .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n            idf.py add-dependency esp_wrover_kit\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32s2\\n\\n        **Here is an example of how to add ESP32-S2-Kaluga-Kit BSP to your project:**\\n\\n        .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n            idf.py add-dependency esp32_s2_kaluga_kit\\n\\n    .. only:: esp32s3\\n\\n        **Here is an example of how to add ESP-BOX BSP to your project:**\\n\\n        .. code-block:: bash\\n\\n            idf.py add-dependency esp-box\\n\\n    More examples of BSP usage can be found in `BSP examples folder <https://github.com/espressif/esp-bsp/tree/master/examples>`_.\\n\\nFlash Erase\\n~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nErasing the flash is also possible. To erase the entire flash memory you can run the following command:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    idf.py -p PORT erase-flash\\n\\nFor erasing the OTA data, if present, you can run this command:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    idf.py -p PORT erase-otadata\\n\\nThe flash erase command can take a while to be done. Do not disconnect your device while the flash erasing is in progress.\\n',\n",

If device driver does not install automatically, identify USB-to-UART bridge on your {IDF_TARGET_NAME} board (or external converter dongle), search for drivers in internet and install them.\\n\\nBelow is the list of USB to serial converter chips installed on most of the {IDF_TARGET_NAME} boards produced by Espressif together with links to the drivers:\\n\\n* CP210x: `CP210x USB to UART Bridge VCP Drivers <https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers>`_\\n* FTDI: `FTDI Virtual COM Port Drivers <https://ftdichip.com/drivers/vcp-drivers/>`_\\n\\nPlease check the board user guide for specific USB-to-UART bridge chip used. The drivers above are primarily for reference. Under normal circumstances, the drivers should be bundled with an operating system and automatically installed upon connecting the board to the PC.\\n\\nFor devices downloaded using a USB-to-UART bridge, you can run the following command including the optional argument to define the baud rate.\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    idf.py -p PORT [-b BAUD] flash\\n\\nReplace ``PORT`` with the device name for the serial port of your {IDF_TARGET_NAME} board. Please note that ``-b`` is an optional argument. If you do not specify the baud rate, the default baud rate is ``460800``. If you need to specify the baud rate, replace ``BAUD`` with the baud rate you need.\\n\\nTo check the port name on Windows, please refer to `check-port-on-windows`_. For Linux and macOS users, please see `check-port-on-linux-and-macos`_.\\n\\nFor example, if the port name is ``COM3`` on Windows and your desired baud rate is ``115200``, you can run the following command to flash the device:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    idf.py -p COM3 -b 115200 flash\\n\\nFor Linux users, if the port name is ``/dev/ttyUSB0`` and the desired baud rate is ``115200``, you can run the following command to flash the device:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200 flash\\n\\nFor macOS users, if the port name is ``/dev/cu.usbserial-1401`` and the desired baud rate is ``115200``, you can run the following command to flash the device:\\n\\n.. code-block:: bash\\n\\n    idf.py -p /dev/cu.usbserial-1401 -b 115200 flash\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    If the device does not support the auto download mode, you need to get into the download mode manually. To do so, press and hold the ``BOOT`` button and then press the ``RESET`` button once. After that release the ``BOOT`` button.\\n\\n.. _check-port-on-windows:\\n\\nCheck Port on Windows\\n---------------------\\n\\nCheck the list of identified COM ports in the Windows Device Manager. Disconnect {IDF_TARGET_NAME} and connect it back, to verify which port disappears from the list and then shows back again.\\n\\nFigures below show serial port for ESP32 DevKitC and ESP32 WROVER KIT\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/esp32-devkitc-in-device-manager.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: USB to UART bridge of ESP32-DevKitC in Windows Device Manager\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    USB to UART bridge of ESP32-DevKitC in Windows Device Manager\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/esp32-wrover-kit-in-device-manager.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Two USB Serial Ports of ESP-WROVER-KIT in Windows Device Manager\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Two USB Serial Ports of ESP-WROVER-KIT in Windows Device Manager\\n\\n.. _check-port-on-linux-and-macos:\\n\\nCheck Port on Linux and macOS\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nTo check the device name for the serial port of your {IDF_TARGET_NAME} board (or external converter dongle), run this command two times, first with the board/dongle unplugged, then with plugged in. The port which appears the second time is the one you need:\\n\\nLinux ::\\n\\n    ls /dev/tty*\\n\\nmacOS ::\\n\\n    ls /dev/cu.*\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    macOS users: if you do not see the serial port then check you have the USB/serial drivers installed. See Section `Connect {IDF_TARGET_NAME} to PC`_ for links to drivers. For macOS High Sierra (10.13), you may also have to explicitly allow the drivers to load. Open System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> General and check if there is a message shown here about \"System Software from developer ...\" where the developer name is Silicon Labs or FTDI.\\n\\n.. _linux-dialout-group:\\n\\nAdding User to ``dialout`` or ``uucp`` on Linux\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe currently logged user should have read and write access the serial port over USB. On most Linux distributions, this is done by adding the user to ``dialout`` group with the following command::\\n\\n    sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER\\n\\non Arch Linux this is done by adding the user to ``uucp`` group with the following command::\\n\\n    sudo usermod -a -G uucp $USER\\n\\nMake sure you re-login to enable read and write permissions for the serial port.\\n\\nVerify Serial Connection\\n------------------------\\n\\nNow verify that the serial connection is operational. You can do this using a serial terminal program by checking if you get any output on the terminal after resetting {IDF_TARGET_NAME}.\\n\\n.. only:: esp32c2\\n\\n    The default console baud rate on ESP32-C2 is 115200 when a 40 MHz XTAL is used, or 74880 when a 26 MHz XTAL is used.\\n\\n.. only:: not esp32c2\\n\\n    The default console baud rate on {IDF_TARGET_NAME} is 115200.\\n\\nWindows and Linux\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nIn this example, we use `PuTTY SSH Client <https://www.putty.org/>`_ that is available for both Windows and Linux. You can use other serial programs and set communication parameters like below.\\n\\nRun terminal and set identified serial port. Baud rate = 115200 (if needed, change this to the default baud rate of the chip in use), data bits = 8, stop bits = 1, and parity = N. Below are example screenshots of setting the port and such transmission parameters (in short described as 115200-8-1-N) on Windows and Linux. Remember to select exactly the same serial port you have identified in steps above.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/putty-settings-windows.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Setting Serial Communication in PuTTY on Windows\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Setting Serial Communication in PuTTY on Windows\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../_static/putty-settings-linux.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: Setting Serial Communication in PuTTY on Linux\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    Setting Serial Communication in PuTTY on Linux\\n\\nThen open serial port in terminal and check, if you see any log printed out by {IDF_TARGET_NAME}. The log contents depend on application loaded to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, see `Example Output`_. Reset the board if no log has been printed out.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   Close the serial terminal after verification that communication is working. If you keep the terminal session open, the serial port will be inaccessible for uploading firmware later.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   If there is no log output, check\\n\\n   - if the required power is supplied to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}\\n   - if the board was reset after starting the terminal program\\n   - if the selected serial port is the correct one by using the method stated in `Check Port on Windows`_ and `Check Port on Linux and macOS`_\\n   - if the serial port is not being used by another program\\n   - if the identified port has been selected in serial terminal programs you are using, as stated in `Windows and Linux`_\\n   - if settings of the serial port in serial terminal programs are applicable to corresponding applications\\n   - if the correct USB connector (UART) is used on the development board\\n   - if your application is expected to output some log\\n   - if the log output has not been disabled (use :example:`hello world application <get-started/hello_world>` to test)\\n\\nmacOS\\n^^^^^\\n\\nTo spare you the trouble of installing a serial terminal program, macOS offers the **screen** command.\\n\\n- As discussed in `Check port on Linux and macOS`_, run::\\n\\n    ls /dev/cu.*\\n\\n- You should see similar output::\\n\\n    /dev/cu.Bluetooth-Incoming-Port /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART      /dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART7\\n\\n- The output varies depending on the type and the number of boards connected to your PC. Then pick the device name of your board and run (if needed, change \"115200\" to the default baud rate of the chip in use)::\\n\\n    screen /dev/cu.device_name 115200\\n\\n  Replace ``device_name`` with the name found running ``ls /dev/cu.*``.\\n\\n- What you are looking for is some log displayed by the **screen**. The log contents depend on application loaded to {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, see `Example Output`_. To exit the current **screen** session, type ``Ctrl-A + K``.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n   Do not forget to **exit the current screen session** after verifying that the communication is working. If you fail to do it and just close the terminal window, the serial port will be inaccessible for uploading firmware later.\\n\\nExample Output\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAn example log is shown below.

       " 'Flashing Troubleshooting\\n========================\\n\\n:link_to_translation:`zh_CN:[中文]`\\n\\nFailed to Connect\\n-----------------\\n\\n{IDF_TARGET_STRAP_GPIO:default=\"[NEEDS TO BE UPDATED]\", esp32=\"GPIO0\", esp32s2=\"GPIO0\", esp32s3=\"GPIO0\", esp32c2=\"GPIO9\", esp32c3=\"GPIO9\", esp32c6=\"GPIO9\", esp32h2=\"GPIO9\"}\\n\\nIf you run the given command and see errors such as \"Failed to connect\", there might be several reasons for this. One of the reasons might be issues encountered by ``esptool.py``, the utility that is called by the build system to reset the chip, interact with the ROM bootloader, and flash firmware. One simple solution to try is to manually reset as described below. If it does not help, you can find more details about possible issues in the `esptool troubleshooting <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/troubleshooting.html>`_ page.\\n\\n``esptool.py`` resets {IDF_TARGET_NAME} automatically by asserting DTR and RTS control lines of the USB-to-UART bridge, i.e., FTDI or CP210x (for more information, see :doc:`establish-serial-connection`). The DTR and RTS control lines are in turn connected to ``{IDF_TARGET_STRAP_GPIO}`` and ``CHIP_PU`` (EN) pins of {IDF_TARGET_NAME}, thus changes in the voltage levels of DTR and RTS will boot {IDF_TARGET_NAME} into Firmware Download mode. As an example, check the `schematic <https://dl.espressif.com/dl/schematics/esp32_devkitc_v4-sch-20180607a.pdf>`_ for the ESP32 DevKitC development board.\\n\\nIn general, you should have no problems with the `official esp-idf development boards <https://www.espressif.com/en/products/devkits>`_. However, ``esptool.py`` is not able to reset your hardware automatically in the following cases:\\n\\n- Your hardware does not have the DTR and RTS lines connected to ``{IDF_TARGET_STRAP_GPIO}`` and ``CHIP_PU``.\\n- The DTR and RTS lines are configured differently.\\n- There are no such serial control lines at all.\\n\\nDepending on the kind of hardware you have, it may also be possible to manually put your {IDF_TARGET_NAME} board into Firmware Download mode (reset).\\n\\n- For development boards produced by Espressif, this information can be found in the respective getting started guides or user guides. For example, to manually reset an ESP-IDF development board, hold down the ``Boot`` button (``{IDF_TARGET_STRAP_GPIO}``) and press the ``EN`` button (``CHIP_PU``).\\n- For other types of hardware, try pulling ``{IDF_TARGET_STRAP_GPIO}`` down.\\n',\n",

Please use instead the pin order as in the table above.\\n\\n\\nRMII Clock Selection\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe ethernet MAC and PHY under RMII working mode need a common 50 MHz reference clock (i.e., RMII clock) that can be provided either externally, or generated from internal ESP32 APLL.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    For additional information on the RMII clock selection, please refer to `ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.1 Ethernet board (A) schematic`_, sheet 2, location D2.\\n\\n\\nRMII Clock Sourced Externally by PHY\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nBy default, the ESP32-Ethernet-Kit is configured to provide RMII clock for the IP101GRI PHY\\'s 50M_CLKO output. The clock signal is generated by the frequency multiplication of 25 MHz crystal connected to the PHY. For details, please see the figure below.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/esp32-ethernet-kit-rmii-clk-from-phy.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :scale: 80%\\n    :alt: RMII Clock from IP101GRI PHY\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    RMII Clock from IP101GRI PHY\\n\\nPlease note that the PHY is reset on power up by pulling the RESET_N signal down with a resistor. ESP32 should assert RESET_N high with GPIO5 to enable PHY. Only this can ensure the power-up of system. Otherwise ESP32 may enter download mode (when the clock signal of REF_CLK_50M is at a high logic level during the GPIO0 power-up sampling phase).\\n\\n\\nRMII Clock Sourced Internally from ESP32\\'s APLL\\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\\n\\nAnother option is to source the RMII Clock from internal ESP32 APLL, see figure below. The clock signal coming from GPIO0 is first inverted, to account for transmission line delay, and then supplied to the PHY.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/esp32-ethernet-kit-rmii-clk-to-phy.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :scale: 80%\\n    :alt: RMII Clock from ESP Internal APLL\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    RMII Clock from ESP Internal APLL\\n\\nTo implement this option, users need to remove or add some RC components on the board. For details please refer to `ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.1 Ethernet board (A) schematic`_, sheet 2, location D2. Please note that if the APLL is already used for other purposes (e.g., I2S peripheral), then you have no choice but use an external RMII clock.\\n\\n\\nGPIO Allocation\\n---------------\\n\\nThis section describes allocation of ESP32 GPIOs to specific interfaces or functions of the ESP32-Ethernet-Kit.\\n\\n\\nIP101GRI (PHY) Interface\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe allocation of the ESP32 (MAC) pins to IP101GRI (PHY) is shown in the table below.

To prevent the power-on state of the GPIO0 from being affected by the clock output on the PHY side, the RESET_N signal to PHY defaults to low, turning the clock output off. After power-on you can control RESET_N with GPIO5 to turn the clock output on. See also `RMII Clock Sourced Externally by PHY`_. For PHYs that cannot turn off the clock output through RESET_N, it is recommended to use a crystal module that can be disabled/enabled externally. Similarly like when using RESET_N, the oscillator module should be disabled by default and turned on by ESP32 after power-up. For a reference design please see `ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.1 Ethernet board (A) schematic`_.\\n\\n    2. The ESP32 pins GPIO16 and GPIO17 are not broken out to the ESP32-WROVER-B module and therefore not available for use. If you need to use these pins, please solder a module without PSRAM memory inside, e.g., the ESP32-WROOM-32D or ESP32-SOLO-1.\\n\\n\\nStart Application Development\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nBefore powering up your ESP32-Ethernet-Kit, please make sure that the board is in good condition with no obvious signs of damage.\\n\\n\\nInitial Setup\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n1. Set the **Function Switch** on the :ref:`Ethernet board (A) <get-started-esp32-ethernet-kit-a-v1.1-layout>` to its default position by turning all the switches to **ON**.\\n2. To simplify flashing and testing of the application, do not input extra signals to the board headers.\\n3. The `PoE board (B)`_ can now be plugged in, but do not connect external power to it.\\n4. Connect the :ref:`Ethernet board (A) <get-started-esp32-ethernet-kit-a-v1.1-layout>` to the PC with a USB cable.\\n5. Turn the **Power Switch** from GND to 5V0 position, the **5V Power On LED** should light up.\\n\\n\\nNow to Development\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nProceed to :doc:`../../get-started/index`, where Section :ref:`get-started-step-by-step` will quickly help you set up the development environment and then flash an example project onto your board.\\n\\nMove on to the next section only if you have successfully completed all the above steps.\\n\\n\\nConfigure and Load the Ethernet Example\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAfter setting up the development environment and testing the board, you can configure and flash the :example:`ethernet/basic` example. This example has been created for testing Ethernet functionality. It supports different PHY, including **IP101GRI** installed on :ref:`get-started-esp32-ethernet-kit-v1.1`.\\n\\n\\nSummary of Changes from ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.0\\n-----------------------------------------------\\n\\n* The original inverted clock provided to the PHY by ESP32 using GPIO0 has been replaced by a clock generated on PHY side. The PHY\\'s clock is connected to the ESP32 with same GPIO0. The GPIO2 which was originally used to control the active crystal oscillator on the PHY side, can now be used for other purposes.\\n* On power up, the ESP32 boot strapping pin GPIO0 may be affected by clock generated on the PHY side. To resolve this issue the PHY\\'s Reset-N signal is pulled low using resistor R17 and effectively turning off the PHY\\'s clock output. The Reset-N signal can be then pulled high by ESP32 using GPIO5.\\n* Removed FT2232H chip\\'s external SPI Flash U6.\\n* Removed flow control jumper header J4.\\n* Removed nTRST JTAG signal. The corresponding GPIO4 can now be used for other purposes.\\n* Pull-up resistor R68 on the GPIO15 line is moved to the MTDO side of JTAG.\\n* To make the A and B board connections more foolproof (reduce chances of plugging in the B board in reverse orientation), the original two 4-pin male rows on board A were changed to one 4-pin female row and one 4-pin male row. Corresponding male and female 4-pins rows were installed on board B.\\n\\n\\nOther Versions of ESP32-Ethernet-Kit\\n------------------------------------\\n\\n* :doc:`get-started-ethernet-kit-v1.0`\\n\\n\\nRelated Documents\\n-----------------\\n\\n* `ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.1 Ethernet board (A) schematic`_ (PDF)\\n* `ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.0 PoE board (B) schematic`_ (PDF)\\n* `ESP32 Datasheet <https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32_datasheet_en.pdf>`_ (PDF)\\n* `ESP32-WROVER-B Datasheet <https://espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wrover-b_datasheet_en.pdf>`_ (PDF)\\n* :doc:`../../api-guides/jtag-debugging/index`\\n* :doc:`../../hw-reference/index`\\n\\nFor other design documentation for the board, please contact us at sales@espressif.com.\\n\\n.. _ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.1 Ethernet board (A) schematic: https://dl.espressif.com/dl/schematics/SCH_ESP32-ETHERNET-KIT_A_V1.1_20190711.pdf\\n.. _ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.0 PoE board (B) schematic: https://dl.espressif.com/dl/schematics/SCH_ESP32-ETHERNET-KIT_B_V1.0_20190517.pdf\\n.. _ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.0 Ethernet board (A) schematic: https://dl.espressif.com/dl/schematics/SCH_ESP32-ETHERNET-KIT_A_V1.0_20190517.pdf\\n\\n.. toctree::\\n    :hidden:\\n\\n    get-started-ethernet-kit-v1.0.rst\\n',\n",

To prevent the power-on state of the GPIO0 from being affected by the clock output on the PHY side, the RESET_N signal to PHY defaults to low, turning the clock output off. After power-on you can control RESET_N with GPIO5 to turn the clock output on. See also `RMII Clock Sourced Externally by PHY`_. For PHYs that cannot turn off the clock output through RESET_N, it is recommended to use a crystal module that can be disabled/enabled externally. Similarly like when using RESET_N, the oscillator module should be disabled by default and turned on by ESP32 after power-up. For a reference design please see `ESP32-Ethernet-Kit V1.2 Ethernet board (A) schematic`_.\\n\\n    2.

This board features an integrated LCD screen and microSD card slot.\\n\\nESP-WROVER-KIT comes with the following ESP32 modules:\\n\\n- ESP32-WROOM-32\\n- ESP32-WROVER series\\n\\nIts another distinguishing feature is the embedded FTDI FT2232HL chip - an advanced multi-interface USB bridge. This chip enables to use JTAG for direct debugging of ESP32 through the USB interface without a separate JTAG debugger. ESP-WROVER-KIT makes development convenient, easy, and cost-effective.\\n\\nMost of the ESP32 I/O pins are broken out to the board\\'s pin headers for easy access.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        The version with the ESP32-WROVER module uses ESP32\\'s GPIO16 and GPIO17 as chip select and clock signals for PSRAM. By default, the two GPIOs are not broken out to the board\\'s pin headers in order to ensure reliable performance.\\n\\n\\nFunctionality Overview\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe block diagram below shows the main components of ESP-WROVER-KIT and their interconnections.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/esp-wrover-kit-block-diagram.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: ESP-WROVER-KIT block diagram\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-WROVER-KIT block diagram\\n\\n\\nFunctional Description\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe following two figures and the table below describe the key components, interfaces, and controls of the ESP-WROVER-KIT board.\\n\\n.. _get-started-esp-wrover-kit-v3-board-front:\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/esp-wrover-kit-v3-layout-front.jpg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: ESP-WROVER-KIT board layout - front\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-WROVER-KIT board layout - front\\n\\n.. _get-started-esp-wrover-kit-v3-board-back:\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/esp-wrover-kit-v3-layout-back.jpg\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: ESP-WROVER-KIT board layout - back\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-WROVER-KIT board layout - back\\n\\n\\nThe table below provides description in the following manner:\\n\\n- Starting from the first picture\\'s top right corner and going clockwise\\n- Then moving on to the second picture\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :widths: 25 75\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Key Component\\n      - Description\\n    * - 32.768 kHz\\n      - External precision 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator serves as a clock with low-power consumption while the chip is in Deep-sleep mode.\\n    * - 0R\\n      - Zero-ohm resistor intended as a placeholder for a current shunt, can be desoldered or replaced with a current shunt to facilitate the measurement of ESP32\\'s current consumption in different modes.\\n    * - ESP32 Module\\n      - Either ESP32-WROOM-32 or ESP32-WROVER with an integrated ESP32. The ESP32-WROVER module features all the functions of ESP32-WROOM-32 and integrates an external 32-MBit PSRAM for flexible extended storage and data processing capabilities.\\n    * - FT2232\\n      - The FT2232 chip serves as a multi-protocol USB-to-serial bridge which can be programmed and controlled via USB to provide communication with ESP32. FT2232 also features USB-to-JTAG interface which is available on channel A of the chip, while USB-to-serial is on channel B. The FT2232 chip enhances user-friendliness in terms of application development and debugging. See `ESP-WROVER-KIT V3 schematic`_.\\n    * - UART\\n      - Serial port. The serial TX/RX signals of FT2232 and ESP32 are broken out to the inward and outward sides of JP11 respectively. By default, these pairs of pins are connected with jumpers. To use ESP32\\'s serial interface, remove the jumpers and connect another external serial device to the respective pins.\\n    * - SPI\\n      - By default, ESP32 uses its SPI interface to access flash and PSRAM memory inside the module. Use these pins to connect ESP32 to another SPI device. In this case, an extra chip select (CS) signal is needed. Please note that the interface voltage for the version with ESP32-WROVER is 1.8V, while that for the version with ESP32-WROOM-32 is 3.3V.\\n    * - CTS/RTS\\n      - Serial port flow control signals: the pins are not connected to the circuitry by default. To enable them, short the respective pins of JP14 with jumpers.\\n    * - JTAG\\n      - JTAG interface. JTAG signals of FT2232 and ESP32 are broken out to the inward and outward sides of JP8 respectively. By default, these pairs of pins are disconnected. To enable JTAG, short the respective pins with jumpers as shown in Section `Setup Options`_.\\n    * - EN\\n      - Reset button.\\n    * - Boot\\n      - Download button. Holding down **Boot** and then pressing **EN** initiates Firmware Download mode for downloading firmware through the serial port.\\n    * - USB\\n      - USB interface. Power supply for the board as well as the communication interface between a computer and the board.\\n    * - Power Key\\n      - Power On/Off Switch. Toggling toward **USB** powers the board on, toggling away from **USB** powers the board off.\\n    * - Power Select\\n      - Power supply selector interface. The board can be powered either via USB or via the 5V Input interface. Select the power source with a jumper. For more details, see Section `Setup Options`_, jumper header JP7.\\n    * - 5V Input\\n      - The 5 V power supply interface can be more convenient when the board is operating autonomously (not connected to a computer).\\n    * - LDO\\n      - NCP1117(1A). 5V-to-3.3V LDO. NCP1117 can provide a maximum current of 1A. The LDO on the board has a fixed output voltage. Although, the user can install an LDO with adjustable output voltage. For details, please refer to `ESP-WROVER-KIT V3 schematic`_.\\n    * - Camera\\n      - Camera interface, a standard OV7670 camera module.\\n    * - RGB LED\\n      - Red, green and blue (RGB) light emitting diodes (LEDs), can be controlled by pulse width modulation (PWM).\\n    * - I/O\\n      - All the pins on the ESP32 module are broken out to pin headers. You can program ESP32 to enable multiple functions, such as PWM, ADC, DAC, I2C, I2S, SPI, etc.\\n    * - microSD Card Slot\\n      - Useful for developing applications that access microSD card for data storage and retrieval.\\n    * - LCD\\n      - Support for mounting and interfacing a 3.2” SPI (standard 4-wire Serial Peripheral Interface) LCD, as shown on figure :ref:`get-started-esp-wrover-kit-v3-board-back`.\\n\\n\\n.. _get-started-esp-wrover-kit-v3-setup-options:\\n\\nSetup Options\\n-------------\\n\\nThere are five jumper blocks available to set up the board functionality.

If that hardware is not used, e.g., nothing is plugged into the Camera (JP4) header, then these GPIOs can be used for other purposes.\\n\\nSome of the pins, such as GPIO0 or GPIO2, have multiple functions and some of them are shared among onboard and external peripheral devices. Certain combinations of peripherals cannot work together. For example, it is not possible to do JTAG debugging of an application that is using SD card, because several pins are shared by JTAG and the SD card slot.\\n\\nIn other cases, peripherals can coexist under certain conditions. This is applicable to, for example, LCD screen and SD card that share only a single pin GPIO21. This pin is used to provide D/C (Data/Control) signal for the LCD as well as the CD (Card Detect) signal read from the SD card slot. If the card detect functionality is not essential, then it may be disabled by removing R167, so both LCD and SD may operate together.\\n\\nFor more details on which pins are shared among which peripherals, please refer to the table in the next section.\\n\\n\\nMain I/O Connector/JP1\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe JP1 connector consists of 14x2 male pins whose functions are shown in the middle two \"I/O\" columns of the table below. The two \"Shared With\" columns on both sides describe where else on the board a certain GPIO is used.\\n\\n=====================  =====  =====  =====================\\nShared With            I/O    I/O    Shared With\\n=====================  =====  =====  =====================\\nn/a                    3.3V   GND    n/a\\nNC/XTAL                IO32   IO33   NC/XTAL\\nJTAG, microSD          IO12   IO13   JTAG, microSD\\nJTAG, microSD          IO14   IO27   Camera\\nCamera                 IO26   IO25   Camera, LCD\\nCamera                 IO35   IO34   Camera\\nCamera                 IO39   IO36   Camera\\nJTAG                   EN     IO23   Camera, LCD\\nCamera, LCD            IO22   IO21   Camera, LCD, microSD\\nCamera, LCD            IO19   IO18   Camera, LCD\\nCamera, LCD            IO5    IO17   PSRAM\\nPSRAM                  IO16   IO4    LED, Camera, microSD\\nCamera, LED, Boot      IO0    IO2    LED, microSD\\nJTAG, microSD          IO15   5V\\n=====================  =====  =====  =====================\\n\\nLegend:\\n\\n* NC/XTAL - :ref:`32.768 kHz Oscillator <get-started-esp-wrover-kit-v3-xtal>`\\n* JTAG - :ref:`JTAG / JP8 <get-started-esp-wrover-kit-v3-jtag-header>`\\n* Boot - Boot button / SW2\\n* Camera - :ref:`Camera / JP4 <get-started-esp-wrover-kit-v3-camera-header>`\\n* LED - :ref:`RGB LED <get-started-esp-wrover-kit-v3-rgb-led-connections>`\\n* microSD - :ref:`microSD Card / J4 <get-started-esp-wrover-kit-v3-microsd-card-slot>`\\n* LCD - :ref:`LCD / U5 <get-started-esp-wrover-kit-v3-lcd-connector>`\\n* PSRAM - only in case ESP32-WROVER is installed\\n\\n\\n.. _get-started-esp-wrover-kit-v3-xtal:\\n\\n32.768 kHz Oscillator\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n====  ==========\\n.

This board features an integrated LCD screen and microSD card slot.\\n\\nESP-WROVER-KIT comes with the following ESP32 modules:\\n\\n- ESP32-WROOM-32\\n- ESP32-WROVER series\\n\\nIts another distinguishing feature is the embedded FTDI FT2232HL chip - an advanced multi-interface USB bridge. This chip enables to use JTAG for direct debugging of ESP32 through the USB interface without a separate JTAG debugger. ESP-WROVER-KIT makes development convenient, easy, and cost-effective.\\n\\nMost of the ESP32 I/O pins are broken out to the board's pin headers for easy access.\\n\\n    .. note::\\n\\n        The version with the ESP32-WROVER module uses ESP32's GPIO16 and GPIO17 as chip select and clock signals for PSRAM. By default, the two GPIOs are not broken out to the board's pin headers in order to ensure reliable performance.\\n\\n\\nFunctionality Overview\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe block diagram below shows the main components of ESP-WROVER-KIT and their interconnections.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/esp-wrover-kit-block-diagram.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: ESP-WROVER-KIT block diagram\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-WROVER-KIT block diagram\\n\\n\\nFunctional Description\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe following two figures and the table below describe the key components, interfaces, and controls of the ESP-WROVER-KIT board.\\n\\n.. _get-started-esp-wrover-kit-v2-board-front:\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/esp-wrover-kit-v2-layout-front.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: ESP-WROVER-KIT board layout - front\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-WROVER-KIT board layout - front\\n\\n.. _get-started-esp-wrover-kit-v2-board-back:\\n\\n.. figure:: ../../../_static/esp-wrover-kit-v2-layout-back.png\\n    :align: center\\n    :alt: ESP-WROVER-KIT board layout - back\\n    :figclass: align-center\\n\\n    ESP-WROVER-KIT board layout - back\\n\\n\\nThe table below provides description in the following manner:\\n\\n- Starting from the first picture's top right corner and going clockwise\\n- Then moving on to the second picture\\n\\n.. list-table::\\n    :widths: 25 75\\n    :header-rows: 1\\n\\n    * - Key Component\\n      - Description\\n    * - 32.768 kHz\\n      - External precision 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator serves as a clock with low-power consumption while the chip is in Deep-sleep mode.\\n    * - ESP32 Module\\n      - Either ESP32-WROOM-32 or ESP32-WROVER with an integrated ESP32. The ESP32-WROVER module features all the functions of ESP32-WROOM-32 and integrates an external 32-MBit PSRAM for flexible extended storage and data processing capabilities.\\n    * - CTS/RTS\\n      - Serial port flow control signals: the pins are not connected to the circuitry by default. To enable them, short the respective pins of JP14 with jumpers.\\n    * - UART\\n      - Serial port. The serial TX/RX signals of FT2232 and ESP32 are broken out to the inward and outward sides of JP11 respectively. By default, these pairs of pins are connected with jumpers. To use ESP32's serial interface, remove the jumpers and connect another external serial device to the respective pins.\\n    * - SPI\\n      - By default, ESP32 uses its SPI interface to access flash and PSRAM memory inside the module. Use these pins to connect ESP32 to another SPI device. In this case, an extra chip select (CS) signal is needed. Please note that the interface voltage for the version with ESP32-WROVER is 1.8V, while that for the version with ESP32-WROOM-32 is 3.3 V.\\n    * - JTAG\\n      - JTAG interface. JTAG signals of FT2232 and ESP32 are broken out to the inward and outward sides of JP8 respectively. By default, these pairs of pins are disconnected. To enable JTAG, short the respective pins with jumpers as shown in Section `Setup Options`_.\\n    * - FT2232\\n      - The FT2232 chip serves as a multi-protocol USB-to-serial bridge which can be programmed and controlled via USB to provide communication with ESP32. FT2232 features USB-to-UART and USB-to-JTAG functionalities.\\n    * - EN\\n      - Reset button.\\n    * - Boot\\n      - Download button.

The difference is the upgraded USB-UART bridge from CP2102 in V4 with up to 1 Mbps transfer rates to CP2102N in V4.1 with up to 3 Mbps transfer rates.\\n\\n\\nWhat You Need\\n-------------\\n\\n* :ref:`ESP32-PICO-KIT mini development board <get-started-pico-kit-v4-board-front>`\\n* USB 2.0 A to Micro B cable\\n* Computer running Windows, Linux, or macOS\\n\\nYou can skip the introduction sections and go directly to Section `Start Application Development`_.\\n\\n\\nOverview\\n--------\\n\\nESP32-PICO-KIT is an ESP32-based mini development board produced by `Espressif <https://espressif.com>`_.\\n\\nThe core of this board is ESP32-PICO-D4 - a System-in-Package (SiP) module with complete Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® functionalities. Compared to other ESP32 modules, ESP32-PICO-D4 integrates the following peripheral components in one single package, which otherwise would need to be installed separately:\\n\\n- 40 MHz crystal oscillator\\n- 4 MB flash\\n- Filter capacitors\\n- RF matching links\\n\\nThis setup reduces the costs of additional external components as well as the cost of assembly and testing and also increases the overall usability of the product.\\n\\nThe development board features a USB-UART Bridge circuit which allows developers to connect the board to a computer\\'s USB port for flashing and debugging.\\n\\nAll the IO signals and system power on ESP32-PICO-D4 are led out to two rows of 20 x 0.1\" header pads on both sides of the development board for easy access. For compatibility with Dupont wires, 2 x 17 header pads are populated with two rows of male pin headers. The remaining 2 x 3 header pads beside the antenna are not populated. These pads may be populated later by the user if required.\\n\\n.. note::\\n\\n    1. There are two versions of ESP32-PICO-KIT boards, respectively with male headers and female headers. In this guide, the male header version is taken as an example.\\n    2. The 2 x 3 pads not populated with pin headers are connected to the flash memory embedded in the ESP32-PICO-D4 SiP module.

If that hardware is not used, e.g., nothing is plugged into the Camera (JP4) header, then these GPIOs can be used for other purposes.\\n\\nSome of the pins, such as GPIO0 or GPIO2, have multiple functions and some of them are shared among onboard and external peripheral devices. Certain combinations of peripherals cannot work together. For example, it is not possible to do JTAG debugging of an application that is using SD card, because several pins are shared by JTAG and the SD card slot.\\n\\nIn other cases, peripherals can coexist under certain conditions. This is applicable to, for example, LCD screen and SD card that share only a single pin GPIO21. This pin is used to provide D/C (Data/Control) signal for the LCD as well as the Card Detect signal read from the SD card slot. If the card detect functionality is not essential, then it may be disabled by removing R167, so both LCD and SD may operate together.\\n\\nFor more details on which pins are shared among which peripherals, please refer to the table in the next section.\\n\\n\\nMain I/O Connector/JP1\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe JP1 connector consists of 14x2 male pins whose functions are shown in the middle two \"I/O\" columns of the table below.

But both extension boards require connection via the ESP32-S2\\'s I2S interface (ESP-LyraT-8311A in Standard mode, ESP-LyraP-CAM in Camera mode). If IO46 is used by both extension boards at the same time, ESP-LyraP-CAM experiences interferences when used.\\n     - No ready solution for now.\\n   * - TouchA v1.1 + LCD32 v1.1\\n     - IO11, IO6\\n     - Touch actions cannot be triggered because of the multiplexed pin IO11. ESP-LyraP-LCD32 is also affected because its BK (BLCT) pin is connected to pin IO6.\\n     - Do not initialize IO11 (NETWORK) and IO6 (PHOTO) for your ESP-LyraP-TouchA.\\n   * - 8311A v1.2 + LCD32 v1.1\\n     - IO6\\n     - The two extension boards can be used at the same time. However, since the BK (BLCT) pin of ESP32-S2-Kaluga-1 is connected to IO6, ESP-LyraT-8311A\\'s pin BT_ADC cannot be used and the board\\'s six buttons will not be available.\\n     - There is a solution that will allow you to use ESP-LyraT-8311A\\'s pin BT_ADC, but will stop you from controlling the display background brightness with software: on your ESP-LyraP-LCD32 board, remove R39, change R41 to 100 Ohm, switch BLCT_L to on.\\n   * - TouchA v1.1 + 8311A v1.2\\n     - Pin BT_ADC on ESP-LyraT-8311A\\n     - The two extension boards can be used at the same time. However, ESP-LyraP-TouchA cannot be triggered if ESP-LyraT-8311A\\'s pin BT_ADC is used to initialize the board\\'s six buttons.\\n     - If you plan to use ESP-LyraT-8311A\\'s pin BT_ADC, do not initialize pin IO6 (PHOTO) for your ESP-LyraP-TouchA.\\n   * - TouchA v1.1 + CAM v1.0\\n     - IO1, IO2, IO3\\n     - Cannot be used simultaneously because of the mentioned multiplexed pins.\\n     - For ESP-LyraP-TouchA, do not initialize IO1 (VOL_UP), IO2 (PLAY), and IO3 (VOL_DOWN).\\n   * - TouchA v1.1 + LCD32 v1.1 + CAM v1.0\\n     - IO1, IO2, IO3, IO6, IO11\\n     - Conflicts on the mentioned multiplexed pins.\\n     - **Solution 1**: For ESP-LyraP-TouchA, do not initialize IO1 (VOL_UP), IO2 (PLAY), IO3 (VOL_DOWN), IO6 (PHOTO) and IO11 (NETWORK). **Solution 2**: It will allow you to initialize IO6 (PHOTO) properly, but will stop you from controlling the background brightness with software. On your ESP-LyraP-LCD32, remove R39, change R41 to 100 Ohm, switch BLCT_L to on.\\n   * - TouchA v1.1 + LCD32 v1.1 + 8311A v1.2\\n     - IO6, IO11\\n     - IO11 is multiplexed; IO6 is also multiplexed stopping you from using ESP-LyraT-8311A\\'s pin BT_ADC that is needed to initialize the board\\'s six buttons.\\n     - **Solution 1**: For ESP-LyraP-TouchA, do not initialize IO6 (PHOTO) and IO11 (NETWORK). Please note that the six buttons on ESP-LyraT-8311A still cannot be used. **Solution 2**: On your ESP-LyraP-LCD32, remove R39, change R41 to 100 Ohm, switch BLCT_L to on. For your ESP-LyraP-TouchA, do not initialize IO11 (NETWORK). If you want to use the six buttons on your ESP-LyraT-8311A, also do not initialize IO6 (PHOTO).\\n\\nAlso, all extension boards and the :ref:`JTAG interface <jtag-debugging-tip-jtag-pins-reconfigured>` share the same pins IO39, IO40, IO41 and IO42.
