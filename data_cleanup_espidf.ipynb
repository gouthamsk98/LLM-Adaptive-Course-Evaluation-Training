       "'API Conventions\\nThis document describes conventions and assumptions common to ESP-IDF Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).\\nESP-IDF provides several kinds of programming interfaces:\\nC functions, structures, enums, type definitions, and preprocessor macros declared in public header files of ESP-IDF components. Various pages in the API Reference section of the programming guide contain descriptions of these functions, structures, and types.\\nBuild system functions, predefined variables, and options. These are documented in the ESP-IDF CMake Build System API.\\nKconfig options can be used in code and in the build system (\\nCMakeLists.txt) files.\\nHost tools and their command line parameters are also part of the ESP-IDF interfaces.\\nESP-IDF is made up of multiple components where these components either contain code specifically written for ESP chips, or contain a third-party library (i.e., a third-party component). In some cases, third-party components contain an \"ESP-IDF specific\" wrapper in order to provide an interface that is either simpler or better integrated with the rest of ESP-IDF\\'s features. In other cases, third-party components present the original API of the underlying library directly.\\nThe following sections explain some of the aspects of ESP-IDF APIs and their usage.\\nError Handling\\nMost ESP-IDF APIs return error codes defined with the\\nesp_err_t type. See Error Handling section for more information about error handling approaches. Error Codes Reference contains the list of error codes returned by ESP-IDF components.\\nConfiguration Structures\\nImportant\\nCorrect initialization of configuration structures is an important part of making the application compatible with future versions of ESP-IDF.\\nMost initialization, configuration, and installation functions in ESP-IDF (typically named\\n..._init(),\\n..._config(), and\\n..._install()) take a configuration structure pointer as an argument. For example:\\nconst esp_timer_create_args_t my_timer_args = {\\n.callback = &my_timer_callback,\\n.arg = callback_arg,\\n.name = \"my_timer\"\\n};\\nesp_timer_handle_t my_timer;\\nesp_err_t err = esp_timer_create(&my_timer_args, &my_timer);\\nThese functions never store the pointer to the configuration structure, so it is safe to allocate the structure on the stack.\\nThe application must initialize all fields of the structure. The following is incorrect:\\nesp_timer_create_args_t my_timer_args;\\nmy_timer_args.callback = &my_timer_callback;\\n/* Incorrect! Fields .arg and .name are not initialized */\\nesp_timer_create(&my_timer_args, &my_timer);\\nMost ESP-IDF examples use C99 designated initializers for structure initialization since they provide a concise way of setting a subset of fields, and zero-initializing the remaining fields:\\nconst esp_timer_create_args_t my_timer_args = {\\n.callback = &my_timer_callback,\\n/* Correct, fields .arg and .name are zero-initialized */\\n};\\nThe C++ language supports designated initializer syntax, too, but the initializers must be in the order of declaration. When using ESP-IDF APIs in C++ code, you may consider using the following pattern:\\n/* Correct, fields .dispatch_method, .name and .skip_unhandled_events are zero-initialized */\\nconst esp_timer_create_args_t my_timer_args = {\\n.callback = &my_timer_callback,\\n.arg = &my_arg,\\n};\\n///* Incorrect, .arg is declared after .callback in esp_timer_create_args_t */\\n//const esp_timer_create_args_t my_timer_args = {\\n// .arg = &my_arg,\\n// .callback = &my_timer_callback,\\n//};\\nFor more information on designated initializers, see Designated Initializers. Note that C++ language versions older than C++20, which are not the default in the current version of ESP-IDF, do not support designated initializers. If you have to compile code with an older C++ standard than C++20, you may use GCC extensions to produce the following pattern:\\nesp_timer_create_args_t my_timer_args = {};\\n/* All the fields are zero-initialized */\\nmy_timer_args.callback = &my_timer_callback;\\nDefault Initializers\\nFor some configuration structures, ESP-IDF provides macros for setting default values of fields:\\nhttpd_config_t config = HTTPD_DEFAULT_CONFIG();\\n/* HTTPD_DEFAULT_CONFIG expands to a designated initializer. Now all fields are set to the default values, and any field can still be modified: */\\nconfig.server_port = 8081;\\nhttpd_handle_t server;\\nesp_err_t err = httpd_start(&server, &config);\\nIt is recommended to use default initializer macros whenever they are provided for a particular configuration structure.\\nPrivate APIs\\nCertain header files in ESP-IDF contain APIs intended to be used only in ESP-IDF source code rather than by the applications. Such header files often contain\\nprivate or\\nesp_private in their name or path. Certain components, such as hal only contain private APIs.\\nPrivate APIs may be removed or changed in an incompatible way between minor or patch releases.\\nComponents in Example Projects\\nESP-IDF examples contain a variety of projects demonstrating the usage of ESP-IDF APIs. In order to reduce code duplication in the examples, a few common helpers are defined inside components that are used by multiple examples. This includes components located in common_components directory, as well as some of the components located in the examples themselves. These components are not considered to be part of the ESP-IDF API.\\nIt is not recommended to reference these components directly in custom projects (via\\nEXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS build system variable), as they may change significantly between ESP-IDF versions. When starting a new project based on an ESP-IDF example, copy both the project and the common components it depends on out of ESP-IDF, and treat the common components as part of the project. Note that the common components are written with examples in mind, and might not include all the error handling required for production applications. Before using, take time to read the code and understand if it is applicable to your use case.\\nAPI Stability\\nESP-IDF uses Semantic Versioning as explained in the Versioning Scheme.\\nMinor and bugfix releases of ESP-IDF guarantee compatibility with previous releases. The sections below explain different aspects and limitations to compatibility.\\nSource-level Compatibility\\nESP-IDF guarantees source-level compatibility of C functions, structures, enums, type definitions, and preprocessor macros declared in public header files of ESP-IDF components. Source-level compatibility implies that the application source code can be recompiled with the newer version of ESP-IDF without changes.\\nThe following changes are allowed between minor versions and do not break source-level compatibility:\\nDeprecating functions (using the\\ndeprecatedattribute) and header files (using a preprocessor\\n#warning). Deprecations are listed in ESP-IDF release notes. It is recommended to update the source code to use the newer functions or files that replace the deprecated ones, however, this is not mandatory. Deprecated functions and files can be removed from major versions of ESP-IDF.\\nRenaming components, moving source and header files between components — provided that the build system ensures that correct files are still found.\\nRenaming Kconfig options. Kconfig system\\'s backward compatibility ensures that the original Kconfig option names can still be used by the application in\\nsdkconfigfile, CMake files, and source code.\\nLack of Binary Compatibility\\nESP-IDF does not guarantee binary compatibility between releases. This means that if a precompiled library is built with one ESP-IDF version, it is not guaranteed to work the same way with the next minor or bugfix release. The following are the possible changes that keep source-level compatibility but not binary compatibility:\\nChanging numerical values for C enum members.\\nAdding new structure members or changing the order of members. See Configuration Structures for tips that help ensure compatibility.\\nReplacing an\\nexternfunction with a\\nstatic inlineone with the same signature, or vice versa.\\nReplacing a function-like macro with a compatible C function.\\nOther Exceptions from Compatibility\\nWhile we try to make upgrading to a new ESP-IDF version easy, there are parts of ESP-IDF that may change between minor versions in an incompatible way. We appreciate issuing reports about any unintended breaking changes that do not fall into the categories below.\\nFeatures clearly marked as \"beta\", \"preview\", or \"experimental\".\\nChanges made to mitigate security issues or to replace insecure default behaviors with secure ones.\\nFeatures that were never functional. For example, if it was never possible to use a certain function or an enumeration value, it may get renamed (as part of fixing it) or removed. This includes software features that depend on non-functional chip hardware features.\\nUnexpected or undefined behavior that is not documented explicitly may be fixed/changed, such as due to missing validation of argument ranges.\\nLocation of Kconfig options in menuconfig.\\nLocation and names of example projects.'"

       "['API Conventions\\nThis document describes conventions and assumptions common to ESP-IDF Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).\\n  ESP-IDF provides several kinds of programming interfaces:\\nC functions, structures, enums, type definitions, and preprocessor macros declared in public header files of ESP-IDF components. Various pages in the API Reference section of the programming guide contain descriptions of these functions, structures, and types.\\n  Build system functions, predefined variables, and options. These are documented in the ESP-IDF CMake Build System API.\\n  Kconfig options can be used in code and in the build system (\\nCMakeLists.txt) files.\\n  Host tools and their command line parameters are also part of the ESP-IDF interfaces.\\n  ESP-IDF is made up of multiple components where these components either contain code specifically written for ESP chips, or contain a third-party library (i.e., a third-party component). In some cases, third-party components contain an \"ESP-IDF specific\" wrapper in order to provide an interface that is either simpler or better integrated with the rest of ESP-IDF\\'s features. In other cases, third-party components present the original API of the underlying library directly.\\n  The following sections explain some of the aspects of ESP-IDF APIs and their usage.\\n  Error Handling\\nMost ESP-IDF APIs return error codes defined with the\\nesp_err_t type. See Error Handling section for more information about error handling approaches. Error Codes Reference contains the list of error codes returned by ESP-IDF components.\\n  Configuration Structures\\nImportant\\nCorrect initialization of configuration structures is an important part of making the application compatible with future versions of ESP-IDF.\\n  Most initialization, configuration, and installation functions in ESP-IDF (typically named\\n..._init(),\\n..._config(), and\\n..._install()) take a configuration structure pointer as an argument.',\n",
       " 'The following is incorrect:\\nesp_timer_create_args_t my_timer_args;\\nmy_timer_args.callback = &my_timer_callback;\\n/* Incorrect! Fields .arg and .name are not initialized */\\nesp_timer_create(&my_timer_args, &my_timer);\\nMost ESP-IDF examples use C99 designated initializers for structure initialization since they provide a concise way of setting a subset of fields, and zero-initializing the remaining fields:\\nconst esp_timer_create_args_t my_timer_args = {\\n.callback = &my_timer_callback,\\n/* Correct, fields .arg and .name are zero-initialized */\\n};\\nThe C++ language supports designated initializer syntax, too, but the initializers must be in the order of declaration. When using ESP-IDF APIs in C++ code, you may consider using the following pattern:\\n/* Correct, fields .dispatch_method, .name and .skip_unhandled_events are zero-initialized */\\nconst esp_timer_create_args_t my_timer_args',\n",
       " 'Note that C++ language versions older than C++20, which are not the default in the current version of ESP-IDF, do not support designated initializers. If you have to compile code with an older C++ standard than C++20, you may use GCC extensions to produce the following pattern:\\nesp_timer_create_args_t my_timer_args = {};\\n/* All the fields are zero-initialized */\\nmy_timer_args.callback = &my_timer_callback;\\nDefault Initializers\\nFor some configuration structures, ESP-IDF provides macros for setting default values of fields:\\nhttpd_config_t config = HTTPD_DEFAULT_CONFIG();\\n/',\n",
       " 'HTTPD_DEFAULT_CONFIG expands to a designated initializer. Now all fields are set to the default values, and any field can still be modified: */\\nconfig.server_port = 8081;\\nhttpd_handle_t server;\\nesp_err_t err = httpd_start(&server, &config);\\nIt is recommended to use default initializer macros whenever they are provided for a particular configuration structure.\\n  Private APIs\\nCertain header files in ESP-IDF contain APIs intended to be used only in ESP-IDF source code rather than by the applications. Such header files often contain\\nprivate or\\nesp_private in their name or path. Certain components, such as hal only contain private APIs.\\n  Private APIs may be removed or changed in an incompatible way between minor or patch releases.\\n  Components in Example Projects\\nESP-IDF examples contain a variety of projects demonstrating the usage of ESP-IDF APIs. In order to reduce code duplication in the examples, a few common helpers are defined inside components that are used by multiple examples. This includes components located in common_components directory, as well as some of the components located in the examples themselves. These components are not considered to be part of the ESP-IDF API.\\n  It is not recommended to reference these components directly in custom projects (via\\nEXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS build system variable), as they may change significantly between ESP-IDF versions. When starting a new project based on an ESP-IDF example, copy both the project and the common components it depends on out of ESP-IDF, and treat the common components as part of the project. Note that the common components are written with examples in mind, and might not include all the error handling required for production applications. Before using, take time to read the code and understand if it is applicable to your use case.\\n ',\n",

       " 'ESP HTTP Client\\nOverview\\nesp_http_client component provides a set of APIs for making HTTP/S requests from ESP-IDF applications. The steps to use these APIs are as follows:\\n-\\nesp_http_client_init(): Creates an\\nesp_http_client_handle_tinstance, i.e., an HTTP client handle based on the given\\nesp_http_client_config_tconfiguration. This function must be the first to be called; default values are assumed for the configuration values that are not explicitly defined by the user.\\n-\\nesp_http_client_perform(): Performs all operations of the\\nesp_http_client- opening the connection, exchanging data, and closing the connection (as required), while blocking the current task before its completion. All related events are invoked through the event handler (as specified in\\nesp_http_client_config_t).\\n-\\nesp_http_client_cleanup(): Closes the connection (if any) and frees up all the memory allocated to the HTTP client instance. This must be the last function to be called after the completion of operations.\\n  Application Example\\n Simple example that uses ESP HTTP Client to make HTTP/S requests can be found at protocols/esp_http_client.\\n  Basic HTTP Request\\nCheck out the example functions\\nhttp_rest_with_url and\\nhttp_rest_with_hostname_path in the application example for implementation details.\\n  Persistent Connections\\nPersistent connection means that the HTTP client can re-use the same connection for several exchanges. If the server does not request to close the connection with the\\nConnection: close header, the connection is not dropped but is instead kept open and used for further requests.\\n  To allow ESP HTTP client to take full advantage of persistent connections, one should make as many requests as possible using the same handle instance.

In the case of ESP HTTP Client, the diagnostic information can be collected by registering an event handler with the Event Loop library. This feature has been added by keeping in mind the ESP Insights framework which collects the diagnostic information. However, this feature can also be used without any dependency on the ESP Insights framework for the diagnostic purpose.

By default, the API performs request in a blocking manner and returns when done, or if it failed, and in non-blocking manner, it returns if EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK or EINPROGRESS is encountered, or if it failed.

       " 'HTTP Server\\nOverview\\nThe HTTP Server component provides an ability for running a lightweight web server on ESP32. Following are detailed steps to use the API exposed by HTTP Server:\\n-\\nhttpd_start(): Creates an instance of HTTP server, allocate memory/resources for it depending upon the specified configuration and outputs a handle to the server instance. The server has both, a listening socket (TCP) for HTTP traffic, and a control socket (UDP) for control signals, which are selected in a round robin fashion in the server task loop. The task priority and stack size are configurable during server instance creation by passing\\nhttpd_config_tstructure to\\nhttpd_start(). TCP traffic is parsed as HTTP requests and, depending on the requested URI, user registered handlers are invoked which are supposed to send back HTTP response packets.\\n-\\nhttpd_stop(): This stops the server with the provided handle and frees up any associated memory/resources. This is a blocking function that first signals a halt to the server task and then waits for the task to terminate. While stopping, the task closes all open connections, removes registered URI handlers and resets all session context data to empty.\\n-\\nhttpd_register_uri_handler(): A URI handler is registered by passing object of type\\nhttpd_uri_tstructure which has members including\\nuriname,\\nmethodtype (eg.\\nHTTPD_GET/HTTPD_POST/HTTPD_PUTetc.), function pointer of type\\nesp_err_t *handler (httpd_req_t *req)and\\nuser_ctxpointer to user context data.\\n Application Example\\n/*',\n",

This could be used, e.g., for testing or in trusted environments where you prefer speed over security.\\n Performance\\nThe initial session setup can take about two seconds, or more with slower clock speed or more verbose logging.

       " 'ICMP Echo\\nOverview\\nICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is used for diagnostic or control purposes or generated in response to errors in IP operations. The common network util\\nping is implemented based on the ICMP packets with the type field value of 0, also called\\nEcho Reply.\\n  During a ping session, the source host firstly sends out an ICMP echo request packet and wait for an ICMP echo reply with specific times. In this way, it also measures the round-trip time for the messages. After receiving a valid ICMP echo reply, the source host will generate statistics about the IP link layer (e.g., packet loss, elapsed time, etc).\\n  It is common that IoT device needs to check whether a remote server is alive or not. The device should show the warnings to users when it got offline. It can be achieved by creating a ping session and sending or parsing ICMP echo packets periodically.\\nTo make this internal procedure much easier for users, ESP-IDF provides some out-of-box APIs.\\n  Create a New Ping Session\\nTo create a ping session, you need to fill in the\\nesp_ping_config_t configuration structure firstly, specifying target IP address, interval times, and etc. Optionally, you can also register some callback functions with the\\nesp_ping_callbacks_t structure.\\n ',\n",

By default, only Mbed TLS is available and used in ESP-IDF whereas wolfSSL is available publicly at <https://github.com/espressif/esp-wolfSSL> with the upstream submodule pointer.\\n Please refer to ESP-TLS: Underlying SSL/TLS Library Options docs for more information on this and comparison of Mbed TLS and wolfSSL.\\nImportant Config Options\\nFollowing is a brief list of important config options accessible at\\nComponent Config -> mbedTLS.

In ESP-NOW, application data is encapsulated in a vendor-specific action frame and then transmitted from one Wi-Fi device to another without connection.\\n  CTR with CBC-MAC Protocol (CCMP) is used to protect the action frame for security. ESP-NOW is widely used in smart light, remote controlling, sensor, etc.\\nFrame Format\\nESP-NOW uses a vendor-specific action frame to transmit ESP-NOW data. The default ESP-NOW bit rate is 1 Mbps.',\n",

The third address field is set to broadcast address (0xff:0xff:0xff:0xff:0xff:0xff).\\n  Security\\nESP-NOW uses the CCMP method, which is described in IEEE Std. 802.11-2012, to protect the vendor-specific action frame.',\n",

Several reasons can lead to ESP-NOW fails to send data. For example, the destination device does not exist; the channels of the devices are not the same; the action frame is lost when transmitting on the air, etc. It is not guaranteed that application layer can receive the data. If necessary, send back ack data when receiving ESP-NOW data. If receiving ack data timeouts, retransmit the ESP-NOW data. A sequence number can also be assigned to ESP-NOW data to drop the duplicate data.\\n  If there is a lot of ESP-NOW data to send, call\\nesp_now_send() to send less than or equal to 250 bytes of data once a time.

It is a secure and standardized provisioning protocol for configuration of Wi-Fi Devices. With Easy Connect, adding a new device to a network is as simple as scanning a QR Code. This reduces complexity and enhances user experience while onboarding devices without UI like Smart Home and IoT products. Unlike old protocols like Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), Wi-Fi Easy Connect in corporates strong encryption through public key cryptography to ensure networks remain secure as new devices are added.\\n  Easy Connect brings many benefits in the user experience:\\n-\\nSimple and intuitive to use; no lengthy instructions to follow for new device setup\\n-\\nNo need to remember and enter passwords into the device being provisioned\\n-\\nWorks with electronic or printed QR codes, or human-readable strings\\n-\\nSupports both WPA2 and WPA3 networks\\nPlease refer to Wi-Fi Alliance\\'s official page on Easy Connect for more information.\\n  ESP32 supports Enrollee mode of Easy Connect with QR Code as the provisioning method.

The provisioning device needs to be connected to the AP which need not support Wi-Fi Easy ConnectTM.\\nEasy Connect is still an evolving protocol. Of known platforms that support the QR Code method are some Android smartphones with Android 10 or higher.

       " 'Wi-Fi AwareTM (NAN)\\nWi-Fi AwareTM or NAN (Neighbor Awareness Networking) is a protocol that allows Wi-Fi devices to discover services in their proximity. Typically, location-based services are based on querying servers for information about the environment and the location knowledge is based on GPS or other location reckoning techniques. However, NAN does not require real-time connection to servers, GPS or other geo-location, but instead uses direct device-to-device Wi-Fi to discover and exchange information. NAN scales effectively in dense Wi-Fi environments and complements the connectivity of Wi-Fi by providing information about people and services in the proximity.\\n Multiple NAN devices which are in the vicinity form a NAN cluster which allows them to communicate with each other. Devices within a NAN cluster can advertise (Publish method) or look for (Subscribe method) services using NAN Service Discovery protocols. Matching of services is done by service name, once a match is found, a device can either send a message or establish an IPv6 Datapath with the peer.\\n ESP32 supports Wi-Fi Aware in standalone mode with support for both Service Discovery and Datapath. Wi-Fi Aware is still an evolving protocol. Please refer to Wi-Fi Alliance\\'s official page on Wi-Fi Aware for more information. Many Android smartphones with Android 8 or higher support Wi-Fi Aware.

       " 'Ethernet\\nOverview\\nESP-IDF provides a set of consistent and flexible APIs to support both internal Ethernet MAC (EMAC) controller and external SPI-Ethernet modules.\\n This programming guide is split into the following sections:\\nBasic Ethernet Concepts\\nEthernet is an asynchronous Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detect (CSMA/CD) protocol/interface. It is generally not well suited for low-power applications. However, with ubiquitous deployment, internet connectivity, high data rates, and limitless-range expandability, Ethernet can accommodate nearly all wired communications.\\n Normal IEEE 802.3 compliant Ethernet frames are between 64 and 1518 bytes in length. They are made up of five or six different fields: a destination MAC address (DA), a source MAC address (SA), a type/length field, a data payload, an optional padding field and a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). Additionally, when transmitted on the Ethernet medium, a 7-byte preamble field and Start-of-Frame (SOF) delimiter byte are appended to the beginning of the Ethernet packet.\\n Thus the traffic on the twist-pair cabling appears as shown below:\\nPreamble and Start-of-Frame Delimiter\\n The preamble contains seven bytes of\\n55H. It allows the receiver to lock onto the stream of data before the actual frame arrives.\\n The Start-of-Frame Delimiter (SFD) is a binary sequence\\n10101011 (as seen on the physical medium). It is sometimes considered to be part of the preamble.\\n When transmitting and receiving data, the preamble and SFD bytes will be automatically generated or stripped from the packets.\\n Destination Address\\nThe destination address field contains a 6-byte length MAC address of the device that the packet is directed to. If the Least Significant bit in the first byte of the MAC address is set, the address is a multicast destination.',\n",
       " 'MII usually costs up to 18 signals, while the RMII interface can reduce the consumption to 9.\\n  In RMII mode, both the receiver and transmitter signals are referenced to the\\nREF_CLK. REF_CLK must be stable during any access to PHY and MAC. Generally, there are three ways to generate the\\nREF_CLK depending on the PHY device in your design:\\nSome PHY chips can derive the\\nREF_CLKfrom its externally connected 25 MHz crystal oscillator (as seen the option a in the picture). In this case, you should select\\nCONFIG_ETH_RMII_CLK_INPUTin CONFIG_ETH_RMII_CLK_MODE.\\n  Some PHY chip uses an externally connected 50MHz crystal oscillator or other clock sources, which can also be used as the\\nREF_CLKfor the MAC side (as seen the option b in the picture). In this case, you still need to select\\nCONFIG_ETH_RMII_CLK_INPUTin CONFIG_ETH_RMII_CLK_MODE.\\nSome EMAC controllers can generate the\\nREF_CLKusing an internal high-precision PLL (as seen the option c in the picture). In this case, you should select\\nCONFIG_ETH_RMII_CLK_OUTPUTin CONFIG_ETH_RMII_CLK_MODE.\\n ',\n",
       " 'Note\\nREF_CLK is configured via Project Configuration as described above by default. However, it can be overwritten from user application code by appropriately setting\\neth_esp32_emac_config_t::interface and\\neth_esp32_emac_config_t::clock_config members. See\\nemac_rmii_clock_mode_t and\\nemac_rmii_clock_gpio_t for more details.\\n  Warning\\nIf the RMII clock mode is selected to\\nCONFIG_ETH_RMII_CLK_OUTPUT, then\\nGPIO0 can be used to output the\\nREF_CLK signal. See CONFIG_ETH_RMII_CLK_OUTPUT_GPIO0 for more information.\\n  What is more, if you are not using PSRAM in your design, GPIO16 and GPIO17 are also available to output the reference clock. See CONFIG_ETH_RMII_CLK_OUT_GPIO for more information.\\n  If the RMII clock mode is selected to\\nCONFIG_ETH_RMII_CLK_INPUT, then\\nGPIO0 is the only choice to input the\\nREF_CLK signal. Please note that\\nGPIO0 is also an important strapping GPIO on ESP32. If GPIO0 samples a low level during power-up, ESP32 will go into download mode. The system will get halted until a manually reset. The workaround for this issue is disabling the\\nREF_CLK in hardware by default so that the strapping pin is not interfered by other signals in the boot stage. Then, re-enable the\\nREF_CLK in the Ethernet driver installation stage.\\n  The ways to disable the\\nREF_CLK signal can be:\\nDisable or power down the crystal oscillator (as the case b in the picture).\\n  Force the PHY device to reset status (as the case a in the picture). This could fail for some PHY device (i.e., it still outputs signals to GPIO0 even in reset state).\\n  No matter which RMII clock mode you select, you really need to take care of the signal integrity of REF_CLK in your hardware design! Keep the trace as short as possible. Keep it away from RF devices and inductor elements.\\n ',\n",
       " \"Note\\nESP-IDF only supports the RMII interface (i.e., always select\\nCONFIG_ETH_PHY_INTERFACE_RMII in the Kconfig option CONFIG_ETH_PHY_INTERFACE).\\n  Signals used in the data plane are fixed to specific GPIOs via MUX, they can not be modified to other GPIOs. Signals used in the control plane can be routed to any free GPIOs via Matrix. Please refer to ESP32-Ethernet-Kit for hardware design example.\\n  You need to set up the necessary parameters for MAC and PHY respectively based on your Ethernet board design, and then combine the two together to complete the driver installation.\\n  Configuration for MAC is described in\\neth_mac_config_t, including:\\neth_mac_config_t::sw_reset_timeout_ms: software reset timeout value, in milliseconds. Typically, MAC reset should be finished within 100 ms.\\n  eth_mac_config_t::rx_task_stack_sizeand\\neth_mac_config_t::rx_task_prio: the MAC driver creates a dedicated task to process incoming packets. These two parameters are used to set the stack size and priority of the task.\\n eth_mac_config_t::flags: specifying extra features that the MAC driver should have, it could be useful in some special situations. The value of this field can be OR'd with macros prefixed with\\nETH_MAC_FLAG_.

Usually, this address is configured during hardware design by pulling up/down some PHY strapping pins. You can set the value from\\n0to\\n15based on your Ethernet board. Especially, if the SMI bus is shared by only one PHY device, setting this value to\\n-1can enable the driver to detect the PHY address automatically.\\n  eth_phy_config_t::reset_timeout_ms: reset timeout value, in milliseconds.

       " 'There is only one ESP-NETIF L2 TAP interface device (path name) available. However multiple file descriptors with different configurations can be opened at a time since the ESP-NETIF L2 TAP interface can be understood as a generic entry point to the Layer 2 infrastructure. What is important is then the specific configuration of the particular file descriptor. It can be configured to give access to a specific Network Interface identified by\\nif_key (e.g., ETH_DEF) and to filter only specific frames based on their type (e.g., Ethernet type in the case of IEEE 802.3). Filtering only specific frames is crucial since the ESP-NETIF L2 TAP needs to exist along with the IP stack and so the IP-related traffic (IP, ARP, etc.) should not be passed directly to the user application. Even though this option is still configurable, it is not recommended in standard use cases. Filtering is also advantageous from the perspective of the user\\'s application, as it only gets access to the frame types it is interested in, and the remaining traffic is either passed to other L2 TAP file descriptors or to the IP stack.\\n  ESP-NETIF L2 TAP Interface Usage Manual\\nInitialization\\nTo be able to use the ESP-NETIF L2 TAP interface, it needs to be enabled in Kconfig by CONFIG_ESP_NETIF_L2_TAP first and then registered by\\nesp_vfs_l2tap_intf_register() prior usage of any VFS function.\\n  open()\\nOnce the ESP-NETIF L2 TAP is registered, it can be opened at path name \"/dev/net/tap\". The same path name can be opened multiple times up to CONFIG_ESP_NETIF_L2_TAP_MAX_FDS and multiple file descriptors with a different configuration may access the Data Link Layer frames.\\n  The ESP-NETIF L2 TAP can be opened with the\\nO_NONBLOCK file status flag to make sure the\\nread() does not block. Note that the\\nwrite() may block in the current implementation when accessing a Network interface since it is a shared resource among multiple ESP-NETIF L2 TAP file descriptors and IP stack, and there is currently no queuing mechanism deployed. The file status flag can be retrieved and modified using\\nfcntl().\\n  On success,\\nopen() returns the new file descriptor (a nonnegative integer).',\n",
       " \"On error, -1 is returned, and\\nerrno is set to indicate the error.\\n  ioctl()\\nThe newly opened ESP-NETIF L2 TAP file descriptor needs to be configured prior to its usage since it is not bounded to any specific Network Interface and no frame type filter is configured. The following configuration options are available to do so:\\n-\\nL2TAP_S_INTF_DEVICE- bounds the file descriptor to a specific Network Interface that is identified by its\\nif_key. ESP-NETIF Network Interface\\nif_keyis passed to\\nioctl()as the third parameter. Note that default Network Interfaces\\nif_key's used in ESP-IDF can be found in esp_netif/include/esp_netif_defaults.h.\\n-\\nL2TAP_S_DEVICE_DRV_HNDL- is another way to bound the file descriptor to a specific Network Interface. In this case, the Network interface is identified directly by IO Driver handle (e.g.,\\nesp_eth_handle_tin case of Ethernet). The IO Driver handle is passed to\\nioctl()as the third parameter.\\n-\\nL2TAP_S_RCV_FILTER- sets the filter to frames with the type to be passed to the file descriptor. In the case of Ethernet frames, the frames are to be filtered based on the Length and Ethernet type field. In case the filter value is set less than or equal to 0x05DC, the Ethernet type field is considered to represent IEEE802.3 Length Field, and all frames with values in interval <0, 0x05DC> at that field are passed to the file descriptor. The IEEE802.2 logical link control (LLC) resolution is then expected to be performed by the user's application. In case the filter value is set greater than 0x05DC, the Ethernet type field is considered to represent protocol identification and only frames that are equal to the set value are to be passed to the file descriptor.\\n  All above-set configuration options have a getter counterpart option to read the current settings.\\n  Warning\\nThe file descriptor needs to be firstly bounded to a specific Network Interface by\\nL2TAP_S_INTF_DEVICE or\\nL2TAP_S_DEVICE_DRV_HNDL to make\\nL2TAP_S_RCV_FILTER option available.\\n  Note\\nVLAN-tagged frames are currently not recognized. If the user needs to process VLAN-tagged frames, they need a set filter to be equal to the VLAN tag (i.e., 0x8100 or 0x88A8) and process the VLAN-tagged frames in the user application.\\n  Note\\nL2TAP_S_DEVICE_DRV_HNDL is particularly useful when the user's application does not require the usage of an IP stack and so ESP-NETIF is not required to be initialized too. As a result, Network Interface cannot be identified by its\\nif_key and hence it needs to be identified directly by its IO Driver handle.\\n\",\n",
       " \"On error, -1 is returned, and\\nerrno is set to indicate the error.\\n read()\\nOpened and configured ESP-NETIF L2 TAP file descriptor can be accessed by\\nread() to get inbound frames. The read operation can be either blocking or non-blocking based on the actual state of the\\nO_NONBLOCK file status flag. When the file status flag is set to blocking, the read operation waits until a frame is received and the context is switched to other tasks. When the file status flag is set to non-blocking, the read operation returns immediately. In such case, either a frame is returned if it was already queued or the function indicates the queue is empty. The number of queued frames associated with one file descriptor is limited by CONFIG_ESP_NETIF_L2_TAP_RX_QUEUE_SIZE Kconfig option. Once the number of queued frames reached a configured threshold, the newly arrived frames are dropped until the queue has enough room to accept incoming traffic (Tail Drop queue management).\\nread() returns the number of bytes read.

On error, -1 is returned, and\\nerrno is set to indicate the error.\\nO_NONBLOCK), and the read would block.\\n write()\\nA raw Data Link Layer frame can be sent to Network Interface via opened and configured ESP-NETIF L2 TAP file descriptor. The user's application is responsible to construct the whole frame except for fields which are added automatically by the physical interface device. The following fields need to be constructed by the user's application in case of an Ethernet link: source/destination MAC addresses, Ethernet type, actual protocol header, and user data. The length of these fields is as follows:\\n|\\nDestination MAC\\n|\\nSource MAC\\n|\\nType/Length\\n|\\nPayload (protocol header/data)\\n |\\n6 B\\n|\\n6 B\\n|\\n2 B\\n|\\n0-1486 B\\nIn other words, there is no additional frame processing performed by the ESP-NETIF L2 TAP interface.

From the oneshot mode driver's point of view, an ADC instance is represented by\\nadc_oneshot_unit_handle_t.\\n  To install an ADC instance, set up the required initial configuration structure\\nadc_oneshot_unit_init_cfg_t:\\nadc_oneshot_unit_init_cfg_t::unit_idselects the ADC.

       " 'Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) Calibration Driver\\nIntroduction\\nIn ESP32, the digital-to-analog converter (ADC) compares the input analog voltage to the reference, and determines each bit of the output digital result. By design, the ADC reference voltage for ESP32 is 1100 mV. However, the true reference voltage can range from 1000 mV to 1200 mV among different chips. This guide introduces the ADC calibration driver to minimize the effect of different reference voltages, and get more accurate output results.\\n  Functional Overview\\nThe following sections of this document cover the typical steps to install and use the ADC calibration driver:\\nCalibration Scheme Creation - covers how to create a calibration scheme handle and delete the calibration scheme handle.\\n  Result Conversion - covers how to convert ADC raw result to calibrated result.\\n  Thread Safety - lists which APIs are guaranteed to be thread-safe by the driver.\\n  Minimize Noise - describes a general way to minimize the noise.\\n  Kconfig Options - lists the supported Kconfig options that can be used to make a different effect on driver behavior.\\n ',\n",

From the calibration driver's point of view, an ADC calibration scheme is created for an ADC calibration handle\\nadc_cali_handle_t.\\n  adc_cali_check_scheme() can be used to know which calibration scheme is supported on the chip. If you already know the supported schemes, this step can be skipped. Just call the corresponding function to create the scheme handle.\\n  If you use your custom ADC calibration schemes, you could either modify this function\\nadc_cali_check_scheme(), or just skip this step and call your custom creation function.\\n \",\n",

       " \"Clock Tree\\nThe clock subsystem of ESP32 is used to source and distribute system/module clocks from a range of root clocks. The clock tree driver maintains the basic functionality of the system clock and the intricate relationship among module clocks.\\n  This document starts with the introduction to root and module clocks. Then it covers the clock tree APIs that can be called to monitor the status of the module clocks at runtime.\\n  Introduction\\nThis section lists definitions of ESP32's supported root clocks and module clocks. These definitions are commonly used in the driver configuration, to help select a proper source clock for the peripheral.\\n  Root Clocks\\nRoot clocks generate reliable clock signals. These clock signals then pass through various gates, muxes, dividers, or multipliers to become the clock sources for every functional module: the CPU core(s), Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, the RTC, and the peripherals.\\nESP32's root clocks are listed in\\nsoc_root_clk_t:\\n-\\nInternal 8 MHz RC Oscillator (RC_FAST)\\nThis RC oscillator generates a about 8.5 MHz clock signal output as the\\nRC_FAST_CLK.\\n  The about 8.5 MHz signal output is also passed into a configurable divider, which by default divides the input clock frequency by 256, to generate a\\nRC_FAST_D256_CLK.\\n  The exact frequency of\\nRC_FAST_CLKcan be computed in runtime through calibration on the\\nRC_FAST_D256_CLK.\\n-\\nExternal 2 ~ 40 MHz Crystal (XTAL)\\n-\\nInternal 150 kHz RC Oscillator (RC_SLOW)\\nThis RC oscillator generates a about 150kHz clock signal output as the\\nRC_SLOW_CLK. The exact frequency of this clock can be computed in runtime through calibration.\\n-\\nExternal 32 kHz Crystal - optional (XTAL32K)\\n  The clock source for this\\nXTAL32K_CLKcan be either a 32 kHz crystal connecting to the\\n32K_XPand\\n32K_XNpins or a 32 kHz clock signal generated by an external circuit. The external signal must be connected to the\\n32K_XNpin. Additionally, a 1 nF capacitor must be placed between the\\n32K_XPpin and ground. In this case, the\\n32K_XPpin cannot be used as a GPIO pin.\\n  XTAL32K_CLKcan also be calibrated to get its exact frequency.\\n  Typically, the frequency of the signal generated from an RC oscillator circuit is less accurate and more sensitive to the environment compared to the signal generated from a crystal. ESP32 provides several clock source options for the\\nRTC_SLOW_CLK, and it is possible to make the choice based on the requirements for system time accuracy and power consumption.

       " \"Digital To Analog Converter (DAC)\\nOverview\\nESP32 has two 8-bit DAC (digital to analog converter) channels respectively connected to GPIO25 (Channel 1) and GPIO26 (Channel 2). Each DAC channel can convert the digital value 0~255 to the analog voltage 0~Vref (The reference voltage 'Vref' here is input from the pin VDD3P3_RTC, which ideally equals to the power supply VDD). The output voltage can be calculated as the following:\\nout_voltage = Vref * digi_val / 255\\nThe DAC peripheral supports outputting analog signal in the following ways:\\nOutputting a voltage directly. The DAC channel keeps outputting a specified voltage.\\n Outputting continuous analog signal by DMA. The DAC converts the data in a buffer at a specified frequency.\\n Outputting a cosine wave by the cosine wave generator. The DAC channel can output a cosine wave with specified frequency and amplitude.\\n For other analog output options, see Sigma-Delta Modulation and LED Control. Both modules produce high-frequency PWM/PDM output, which can be hardware low-pass filtered in order to generate a lower frequency analog output.\\nDAC File Structure\\nPublic headers that need to be included in the DAC application are listed as follows:\\ndac.h: The top header file of the legacy DAC driver, which should be only included in the apps which use the legacy driver API.\\n\",\n",

The channels have separate software resources and can be managed by\\ndac_oneshot_handle_t,\\ndac_cosine_handle_t, or\\ndac_continuous_handle_t according to the usage. Registering different modes on a same DAC channel is not allowed.\\n',\n",
       " 'Direct Voltage Output (One-shot/Direct Mode)\\n The DAC channels in the group can convert an 8-bit digital value into the analog when\\ndac_oneshot_output_voltage() is called (it can be called in ISR). The analog voltage is kept on the DAC channel until the next conversion starts. To start the voltage conversion, the DAC channels need to be enabled first through registering by\\ndac_oneshot_new_channel().\\n  Continuous Wave Output (Continuous/DMA Mode)\\nDAC channels can convert digital data continuously via the DMA. There are three ways to write the DAC data:\\n-\\nNormal writing (synchronous): Data can be transmitted at one time and kept blocked until all the data has been loaded into the DMA buffer, and the voltage is kept as the last conversion value while no more data is inputted. It is usually used to transport a long signal like an audio. To convert data continuously, the continuous channel handle need to be allocated by calling\\ndac_continuous_new_channels()and the DMA conversion should be enabled by calling\\ndac_continuous_enable(). Then data can be written by\\ndac_continuous_write()synchronously. Refer to peripherals/dac/dac_continuous/dac_audio for examples.\\n-\\nCyclical writing: A piece of data can be converted cyclically without blocking, and no more operation is needed after the data are loaded into the DMA buffer. But note that the inputted buffer size is limited by the number of descriptors and the DMA buffer size. It is usually used to transport short signals that need to be repeated, e.g., a sine wave. To achieve cyclical writing, call\\ndac_continuous_write_cyclically()after the DAC continuous mode is enabled.',\n",
       " '-\\nAsynchronous writing: Data can be transmitted asynchronously based on the event callback.\\n dac_event_callbacks_t::on_convert_donemust be registered to use asynchronous mode. Users can get the\\ndac_event_data_tin the callback which contains the DMA buffer address and length, allowing them to load the data into the buffer directly. To use the asynchronous writing, call\\ndac_continuous_register_event_callback()to register the\\ndac_event_callbacks_t::on_convert_donebefore enabling, and then\\ndac_continuous_start_async_writing()to start the asynchronous writing. Note that once the asynchronous writing is started, the callback function will be triggered continuously. Call\\ndac_continuous_write_asynchronously()to load the data either in a separate task or in the callback directly.',\n",
       " 'On ESP32, the DAC digital controller can be connected internally to the I2S0 and use its DMA for continuous conversion. Although the DAC only needs 8-bit data for conversion, it has to be the left-shifted 8 bits (i.e., the high 8 bits in a 16-bit slot) to satisfy the I2S communication format. By default, the driver helps to expand the data to 16-bit wide automatically. To expand manually, please disable CONFIG_DAC_DMA_AUTO_16BIT_ALIGN in the menuconfig.\\n  The clock of the DAC digital controller comes from I2S0 as well, so there are two clock sources for selection:\\ndac_continuous_digi_clk_src_t::DAC_DIGI_CLK_SRC_PLL_D2supports frequency between 19.6 KHz to several MHz.

       " 'Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)\\nIntroduction\\nI2C is a serial, synchronous, multi-device, half-duplex communication protocol that allows co-existence of multiple masters and slaves on the same bus. I2C uses two bidirectional open-drain lines: serial data line (SDA) and serial clock line (SCL), pulled up by resistors.\\n ESP32 has 2 I2C controller (also called port), responsible for handling communication on the I2C bus. A single I2C controller can be a master or a slave.\\n Typically, an I2C slave device has a 7-bit address or 10-bit address. ESP32 supports both I2C Standard-mode (Sm) and Fast-mode (Fm) which can go up to 100KHz and 400KHz respectively.\\n Warning\\nThe clock frequency of SCL in master mode should not be larger than 400 KHz\\n Note\\nThe frequency of SCL is influenced by both the pull-up resistor and the wire capacitance. Therefore, users are strongly recommended to choose appropriate pull-up resistors to make the frequency accurate. The recommended value for pull-up resistors usually ranges from 1K Ohms to 10K Ohms.\\n Keep in mind that the higher the frequency, the smaller the pull-up resistor should be (but not less than 1 KOhms). Indeed, large resistors will decline the current, which will increase the clock switching time and reduce the frequency. We usually recommend a range of 2 KOhms to 5 KOhms, but users may also need to make some adjustments depending on their current draw requirements.\\n I2C Clock Configuration\\ni2c_clock_source_t::I2C_CLK_SRC_DEFAULT: Default I2C source clock.\\n i2c_clock_source_t::I2C_CLK_SRC_APB: APB clock as I2C clock source.\\n I2C File Structure\\nPublic headers that need to be included in the I2C application\\ni2c.h: The header file of legacy I2C APIs (for apps using legacy driver).\\n',\n",

(The issue is when asynchronous transaction is very large, it will cause memory problem.)\\n  i2c_master_event_callbacks_t::on_recv_donesets a callback function for master \"transaction-done\" event. The function prototype is declared in\\ni2c_master_callback_t.\\n  I2C slave callbacks\\nWhen an I2C slave bus triggers an interrupt, a specific event will be generated and notify the CPU. If you have some function that needs to be called when those events occurred, you can hook your function to the ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) by calling\\ni2c_slave_register_event_callbacks(). Since the registered callback functions are called in the interrupt context, user should ensure the callback function doesn\\'t attempt to block (e.g. by making sure that only FreeRTOS APIs with\\nISR suffix are called from within the function). The callback function has a boolean return value, to tell the caller whether a high priority task is woke up by it.\\n  I2C slave event callbacks are listed in the\\ni2c_slave_event_callbacks_t.\\n ',\n",

The function prototype is declared in\\ni2c_slave_received_callback_t.\\nPower Management\\nWhen the power management is enabled (i.e. CONFIG_PM_ENABLE is on), the system will adjust or stop the source clock of I2C fifo before going into light sleep, thus potentially changing the I2C signals and leading to transmitting or receiving invalid data.\\n  However, the driver can prevent the system from changing APB frequency by acquiring a power management lock of type\\nESP_PM_APB_FREQ_MAX. Whenever user creates an I2C bus that has selected\\nI2C_CLK_SRC_APB as the clock source, the driver will guarantee that the power management lock is acquired when I2C operations begin and release the lock automatically when I2C operations finish.\\n  IRAM Safe\\nBy default, the I2C interrupt will be deferred when the Cache is disabled for reasons like writing/erasing Flash. Thus the event callback functions will not get executed in time, which is not expected in a real-time application.\\n  There\\'s a Kconfig option CONFIG_I2C_ISR_IRAM_SAFE that will:\\nEnable the interrupt being serviced even when cache is disabled\\nPlace all functions that used by the ISR into IRAM\\nPlace driver object into DRAM (in case it\\'s mapped to PSRAM by accident)\\nThis will allow the interrupt to run while the cache is disabled but will come at the cost of increased IRAM consumption.\\n  Thread Safety\\nThe factory function\\ni2c_new_master_bus() and\\ni2c_new_slave_device() are guaranteed to be thread safe by the driver, which means, user can call them from different RTOS tasks without protection by extra locks. Other public I2C APIs are not thread safe. which means the user should avoid calling them from multiple tasks, if user strongly needs to call them in multiple tasks, please add extra lock.\\n  Kconfig Options\\nCONFIG_I2C_ISR_IRAM_SAFE controls whether the default ISR handler can work when cache is disabled, see also IRAM Safe for more information.\\nCONFIG_I2C_ENABLE_DEBUG_LOG is used to enable the debug log at the cost of increased firmware binary size.\\n  API Reference\\nHeader File\\nThis header file can be included with:\\n#include \"driver/i2c_master.h\"\\nThis header file is a part of the API provided by the\\ndrivercomponent.

The frame buffer is located in the controller's internal GRAM (Graphical RAM). ESP-IDF provides only a limited number of LCD controller drivers out of the box (e.g., ST7789, SSD1306), More Controller Based LCD Drivers are maintained in the Espressif Component Registry.\\n SPI Interfaced LCD describes the steps to install the SPI LCD IO driver and then get the panel handle.\\n I2C Interfaced LCD describes the steps to install the I2C LCD IO driver and then get the panel handle.\\n I80 Interfaced LCD describes the steps to install the I80 LCD IO driver and then get the panel handle.\\n LCD Panel IO Operations - provides a set of APIs to operate the LCD panel, like turning on/off the display, setting the orientation, etc. These operations are common for either controller-based LCD panel driver or RGB LCD panel driver.\\n SPI Interfaced LCD\\nCreate an SPI bus.

       " \"LED Control (LEDC)\\nIntroduction\\nThe LED control (LEDC) peripheral is primarily designed to control the intensity of LEDs, although it can also be used to generate PWM signals for other purposes. It has 8 channels which can generate independent waveforms that can be used, for example, to drive RGB LED devices.\\nLEDC channels are divided into two groups of 8 channels each. One group of LEDC channels operates in high speed mode. This mode is implemented in hardware and offers automatic and glitch-free changing of the PWM duty cycle. The other group of channels operate in low speed mode, the PWM duty cycle must be changed by the driver in software. Each group of channels is also able to use different clock sources.\\n The PWM controller can automatically increase or decrease the duty cycle gradually, allowing for fades without any processor interference.\\n Functionality Overview\\nSetting up a channel of the LEDC in either high or low speed mode is done in three steps:\\nTimer Configuration by specifying the PWM signal's frequency and duty cycle resolution.\\n Channel Configuration by associating it with the timer and GPIO to output the PWM signal.\\n Change PWM Signal that drives the output in order to change LED's intensity. This can be done under the full control of software or with hardware fading functions.\\n As an optional step, it is also possible to set up an interrupt on fade end.\\n\",\n",
       " 'For an initial setup, it is recommended to configure for the timers first (by calling\\nledc_timer_config()), and then for the channels (by calling\\nledc_channel_config()). This ensures the PWM frequency is at the desired value since the appearance of the PWM signal from the IO pad.\\n Timer Configuration\\nSetting the timer is done by calling the function\\nledc_timer_config() and passing the data structure\\nledc_timer_config_t that contains the following configuration settings:\\nSpeed mode\\nledc_mode_t\\nTimer number\\nledc_timer_t\\nPWM signal frequency in Hz\\nResolution of PWM duty\\nSource clock\\nledc_clk_cfg_t\\nThe frequency and the duty resolution are interdependent. The higher the PWM frequency, the lower the duty resolution which is available, and vice versa. This relationship might be important if you are planning to use this API for purposes other than changing the intensity of LEDs. For more details, see Section Supported Range of Frequency and Duty Resolutions.\\n The source clock can also limit the PWM frequency. The higher the source clock frequency, the higher the maximum PWM frequency can be configured.\\n',\n",
       " \"This ensures the accuracy of output PWM signal frequency.\\n  The LEDC driver offers a helper function\\nledc_find_suitable_duty_resolution() to find the maximum possible resolution for the timer, given the source clock frequency and the desired PWM signal frequency.\\n  When a timer is no longer needed by any channel, it can be deconfigured by calling the same function\\nledc_timer_config(). The configuration structure\\nledc_timer_config_t passes in should be:\\nledc_timer_config_t::speed_modeThe speed mode of the timer which wants to be deconfigured belongs to (\\nledc_mode_t)\\nledc_timer_config_t::timer_numThe ID of the timers which wants to be deconfigured (\\nledc_timer_t)\\n  ledc_timer_config_t::deconfigureSet this to true so that the timer specified can be deconfigured\\nChannel Configuration\\nWhen the timer is set up, configure the desired channel (one out of\\nledc_channel_t). This is done by calling the function\\nledc_channel_config().\\n  Similar to the timer configuration, the channel setup function should be passed a structure\\nledc_channel_config_t that contains the channel's configuration parameters.\\n  At this point, the channel should start operating and generating the PWM signal on the selected GPIO, as configured in\\nledc_channel_config_t, with the frequency specified in the timer settings and the given duty cycle. The channel operation (signal generation) can be suspended at any time by calling the function\\nledc_stop().\\n  Change PWM Signal\\nOnce the channel starts operating and generating the PWM signal with the constant duty cycle and frequency, there are a couple of ways to change this signal. When driving LEDs, primarily the duty cycle is changed to vary the light intensity.\\n  The following two sections describe how to change the duty cycle using software and hardware fading. If required, the signal's frequency can also be changed; it is covered in Section Change PWM Frequency.\\n  Change PWM Duty Cycle Using Software\\nTo set the duty cycle, use the dedicated function\\nledc_set_duty(). After that, call\\nledc_update_duty() to activate the changes. To check the currently set value, use the corresponding\\n_get_ function\\nledc_get_duty().\\n  Another way to set the duty cycle, as well as some other channel parameters, is by calling\\nledc_channel_config() covered in Section Channel Configuration.\\n  The range of the duty cycle values passed to functions depends on selected\\nduty_resolution and should be from\\n0 to\\n(2 ** duty_resolution). For example, if the selected duty resolution is 10, then the duty cycle values can range from 0 to 1024.\",\n",
       " 'Supported Range of Frequency and Duty Resolutions\\nThe LED PWM Controller is designed primarily to drive LEDs. It provides a large flexibility of PWM duty cycle settings. For instance, the PWM frequency of 5 kHz can have the maximum duty resolution of 13 bits. This means that the duty can be set anywhere from 0 to 100% with a resolution of ~ 0.012% (2 ** 13 = 8192 discrete levels of the LED intensity). Note, however, that these parameters depend on the clock signal clocking the LED PWM Controller timer which in turn clocks the channel (see timer configuration and the ESP32 Technical Reference Manual > LED PWM Controller (LEDC)',\n",
       " \"The LEDC can be used for generating signals at much higher frequencies that are sufficient enough to clock other devices, e.g., a digital camera module. In this case, the maximum available frequency is 40 MHz with duty resolution of 1 bit. This means that the duty cycle is fixed at 50% and cannot be adjusted.\\n  The LEDC API is designed to report an error when trying to set a frequency and a duty resolution that exceed the range of LEDC's hardware. For example, an attempt to set the frequency to 20 MHz and the duty resolution to 3 bits results in the following error reported on a serial monitor:\\nE (196) ledc: requested frequency and duty resolution cannot be achieved, try reducing freq_hz or duty_resolution. div_param=128\\nIn such a situation, either the duty resolution or the frequency must be reduced.\",\n",
       " 'For example, setting the duty resolution to 2 resolves this issue and makes it possible to set the duty cycle at 25% steps, i.e., at 25%, 50% or 75%.\\n  The LEDC driver also captures and reports attempts to configure frequency/duty resolution combinations that are below the supported minimum, e.g.,:\\nE (196) ledc: requested frequency and duty resolution cannot be achieved, try increasing freq_hz or duty_resolution. div_param=128000000\\nThe duty resolution is normally set using\\nledc_timer_bit_t. This enumeration covers the range from 10 to 15 bits. If a smaller duty resolution is required (from 10 down to 1), enter the equivalent numeric values directly.\\n ',\n",

If the TX Channel was set up first, then during the RX Channel setup, the previous RMT TX Channel signal will be overridden by the GPIO control signal.\\n Uninstall RMT Channel\\nIf a previously installed RMT channel is no longer needed, it is recommended to recycle the resources by calling\\nrmt_del_channel(), which in return allows the underlying software and hardware resources to be reused for other purposes.\\n Carrier Modulation and Demodulation\\nThe RMT transmitter can generate a carrier wave and modulate it onto the message signal. Compared to the message signal, the carrier signal's frequency is significantly higher. In addition, the user can only set the frequency and duty cycle for the carrier signal. The RMT receiver can demodulate the carrier signal from the incoming signal.

It is recommended to leave a tolerance for the carrier frequency. For example, in the snippet below, we set the frequency to 25 KHz, instead of the 38 KHz configured on the TX side. The reason is that reflection and refraction occur when a signal travels through the air, leading to distortion on the receiver side.\\n\",\n",

If you have some function that needs to be called when a particular events occur, you can register a callback for that event to the RMT driver\\'s ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) by calling\\nrmt_tx_register_event_callbacks() and\\nrmt_rx_register_event_callbacks() for TX and RX channel respectively. Since the registered callback functions are called in the interrupt context, the user should ensure the callback function does not block, e.g., by making sure that only FreeRTOS APIs with the\\nFromISR suffix are called from within the function. The callback function has a boolean return value used to indicate whether a higher priority task has been unblocked by the callback.\\n  The TX channel-supported event callbacks are listed in the\\nrmt_tx_event_callbacks_t:\\nrmt_tx_event_callbacks_t::on_trans_donesets a callback function for the \"trans-done\" event.

However, the hardware does not help to convert the user data into RMT symbols, this can only be done in software by the so-called RMT Encoder. The encoder is responsible for encoding user data into RMT symbols and then writing to the RMT memory block or the DMA buffer. For how to create an RMT encoder, please refer to RMT Encoder.\\n  Once you created an encoder, you can initiate a TX transaction by calling\\nrmt_transmit(). This function takes several positional parameters like channel handle, encoder handle, and payload buffer. Besides, you also need to provide a transmission-specific configuration in\\nrmt_transmit_config_t:\\nrmt_transmit_config_t::loop_countsets the number of transmission loops. After the transmitter has finished one round of transmission, it can restart the same transmission again if this value is not set to zero. As the loop is controlled by hardware, the RMT channel can be used to generate many periodic sequences with minimal CPU intervention.\\n  Setting\\nrmt_transmit_config_t::loop_countto -1 means an infinite loop transmission.',\n",

The \"trans-done\" event is not generated as well.\\n  Setting\\nrmt_transmit_config_t::loop_countto a positive number means finite number of iterations.

Otherwise, the function will block until a free slot is available in the queue.\\n  Note\\nThere is a limitation in the transmission size if the\\nrmt_transmit_config_t::loop_count is set to non-zero, i.e., to enable the loop feature. The encoded RMT symbols should not exceed the capacity of the RMT hardware memory block size, or you might see an error message like\\nencoding artifacts can\\'t exceed hw memory block for loop transmission. If you have to start a large transaction by loop, you can try either of the following methods.\\n  Increase the\\nrmt_tx_channel_config_t::mem_block_symbols.

So it is possible that the transaction is not started yet when\\nrmt_transmit() returns. To ensure all pending transactions to complete, the user can use\\nrmt_tx_wait_all_done().\\n  Multiple Channels Simultaneous Transmission\\n In some real-time control applications (e.g., to make two robotic arms move simultaneously), you do not want any time drift between different channels. The RMT driver can help to manage this by creating a so-called Sync Manager. The sync manager is represented by\\nrmt_sync_manager_handle_t in the driver. The procedure of RMT sync transmission is shown as follows:\\nInstall RMT Sync Manager\\nTo create a sync manager, the user needs to tell which channels are going to be managed in the\\nrmt_sync_manager_config_t:\\nrmt_sync_manager_config_t::tx_channel_arraypoints to the array of TX channels to be managed.\\n rmt_sync_manager_config_t::array_sizesets the number of channels to be managed.\\n ',\n",

In addition, if the sync manager is not supported by the hardware, it reports a\\nESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED error.

Before that, the channel is just put in a waiting state. TX channels will usually complete their transactions at different times due to differing transactions, thus resulting in a loss of sync.

There are some special restrictions for an encoding function:\\nDuring a single transaction, the encoding function may be called multiple times. This is necessary because the target RMT memory block cannot hold all the artifacts at once. To overcome this limitation, the driver utilizes a ping-pong approach, where the encoding session is divided into multiple parts. This means that the encoder needs to keep track of its state to continue encoding from where it left off in the previous part.\\n  The encoding function is running in the ISR context. To speed up the encoding session, it is highly recommended to put the encoding function into IRAM. This can also avoid the cache miss during encoding.\\nTo help get started with the RMT driver faster, some commonly used encoders are provided out-of-the-box. They can either work alone or be chained together into a new encoder. See also Composite Pattern for the principle behind it. The driver has defined the encoder interface in\\nrmt_encoder_t, it contains the following functions:\\nrmt_encoder_t::encodeis the fundamental function of an encoder. This is where the encoding session happens.\\n  The function might be called multiple times within a single transaction. The encode function should return the state of the current encoding session.\\n  The supported states are listed in the\\nrmt_encode_state_t.

       " \"SD SPI Host Driver\\nOverview\\nThe SD SPI host driver allows communication with one or more SD cards using the SPI Master driver, which utilizes the SPI host. Each card is accessed through an SD SPI device, represented by an SD SPI handle\\nsdspi_dev_handle_t, which returns when the device is attached to an SPI bus by calling\\nsdspi_host_init_device(). It is important to note that the SPI bus should be initialized beforehand by\\nspi_bus_initialize().\\n  This driver's naming pattern was adopted from the SDMMC Host Driver due to their similarity. Likewise, the APIs of both drivers are also very similar.\\n  SD SPI driver that accesses the SD card in SPI mode offers lower throughput but makes pin selection more flexible. With the help of the GPIO matrix, an SPI peripheral's signals can be routed to any ESP32 pin. Otherwise, if an SDMMC host driver is used (see SDMMC Host Driver) to access the card in SD 1-bit/4-bit mode, higher throughput can be reached while requiring routing the signals through their dedicated IO_MUX pins only.\\n  With the help of SPI Master Driver the SD SPI host driver based on, the SPI bus can be shared among SD cards and other SPI devices. The SPI Master driver will handle exclusive access from different tasks.\\n  The SD SPI driver uses software-controlled CS signal.\\n  How to Use\\nFirstly, use the macro\\nSDSPI_DEVICE_CONFIG_DEFAULT to initialize the structure\\nsdspi_device_config_t, which is used to initialize an SD SPI device. This macro will also fill in the default pin mappings, which are the same as the pin mappings of the SDMMC host driver. Modify the host and pins of the structure to desired value. Then call\\nsdspi_host_init_device to initialize the SD SPI device and attach to its bus.\\n  Then use the\\nSDSPI_HOST_DEFAULT macro to initialize the\\nsdmmc_host_t structure, which is used to store the state and configurations of the upper layer (SD/SDIO/MMC driver). Modify the\\nslot parameter of the structure to the SD SPI device SD SPI handle just returned from\\nsdspi_host_init_device. Call\\nsdmmc_card_init with the\\nsdmmc_host_t to probe and initialize the SD card.\\n  Now you can use SD/SDIO/MMC driver functions to access your card!\\nOther Details\\nOnly the following driver's API functions are normally used by most applications:\\nOther functions are mostly used by the protocol level SD/SDIO/MMC driver via function pointers in the\\nsdmmc_host_t structure. For more details, see SD/SDIO/MMC Driver.\\n \",\n",
       " 'SDIO Card Slave Driver\\nOverview\\nThe ESP32 SDIO Card host and slave peripherals share two sets of pins, as shown in the table below. The first set is usually occupied by the SPI0 bus, which is responsible for the SPI flash holding the code to run. This means the SDIO slave driver can only run on the second set of pins while the SDIO host is not using it.\\n The SDIO slave can run under three modes: SPI, 1-bit SD, and 4-bit SD modes. Based on the signals on the interface, the device can determine the current mode and configure itself to adapt to that mode. Later, the slave driver can communicate with the slave device to properly handle commands and data transfers. According to the SDIO specification, the CMD and DAT0-3 signal lines should be pulled up whether in 1-bit SD, 4-bit SD or SPI mode.\\n',\n",
       " \"4-bit SD mode: Connect all pins, and the ground.\\n SPI mode: Connect SCLK, MOSI, MISO, Interrupt, #CS pins, and the ground.\\n Note\\nPlease check if CMD and DATA lines DAT0-DAT3 of the card are properly pulled up by 10 KOhm - 90 KOhm resistors, which should be ensured even in 1-bit mode or SPI mode. Most official modules do not offer these pullups internally. If you are using official development boards, check Overview of Compatibility to see whether your development boards have such pullups.\\n Note\\nMost official modules have conflicts on strapping pins with the SDIO slave function. If you are using an ESP32 module with 3.3 V flash inside, when you are developing on the module for the first time, you will need to perform an eFuse burn-in prior to development. This will adjust the pin configuration of the module to make the module compatible with SDIO functionality. See Overview of Compatibility for details on how to configure this.\\n Here is a list of modules/kits with 3.3 V flash:\\n-\\nModules: All modules except ESP32-WROVER, ESP32-WROVER-I, ESP32-S3-WROOM-2, and please check Modules Overview for module list\\n-\\nKits: ESP32-PICO-KIT, ESP32-DevKitC (up to v4), ESP32-WROVER-KIT (v4.1 [also known as ESP32-WROVER-KIT-VB], v2, v1 [also known as DevKitJ v1])\\nYou can tell the version of your ESP23-WROVER-KIT version from the module on it: v4.1 are with ESP32-WROVER-B modules, v3 are with ESP32-WROVER modules, while v2 and v1 are with ESP32-WROOM-32 modules.\\n Refer to SD Pull-up Requirements for more technical details of the pullups.\\n The host initializes the slave into SD mode by sending the CMD0 command with the DAT3 pin set to a high level. Alternatively, the host initializes the SPI mode by sending CMD0 with CS pin low, which is the same pin as DAT3.\\n After the initialization, the host can enable the 4-bit SD mode by writing CCCR register 0x07 by CMD52. All the bus detection processes are handled by the slave peripheral.\\n The host has to communicate with the slave by an ESP-slave-specific protocol.\\n The slave driver offers three services over Function 1 access by CMD52 and CMD53:\\nsending and receiving FIFO\\n52 R/W registers (8-bit) shared by host and slave\\n16 interrupt sources (8 from host to slave, and 8 from slave to host)\\nTerminology\\nThe SDIO slave driver uses the following terms:\\nA transfer is initiated by a command token from the host and may consist of a response and multiple data blocks. The core mechanism of the ESP32 SDIO slave driver involves data exchange and communication through transfers.\\n Sending: slave to host transfers.\\n Receiving: host to slave transfers.\\n Note\\nThe register names in ESP32 Technical Reference Manual > SDIO Slave Controller [PDF] are organized from the host's perspective. For instance,\\nRX registers indicate sending, while\\nTX registers denote receiving. In our driver implementation, we've chosen not to utilize the terms\\nTX or\\nRX to prevent any potential ambiguities.\\n\",\n",
       " 'A designated address within Function 1 that can be accessed using CMD53 commands for reading or writing substantial volumes of data. The address corresponds to the length intended for reading from or writing to the slave in a single transfer: requested length = 0x1F800 – address.\\n  Ownership: When the driver assumes ownership of a buffer, it means that the driver has the capability to perform random read/write operations on the buffer (often via DMA). The application should not read/write the buffer until the ownership is returned to the application. If the application reads from a buffer owned by a receiving driver, the data read can be random; similarly, if the application writes to a buffer owned by a sending driver, the data sent may be corrupted.\\n  Requested length: The length requested in one transfer determined by the FIFO address.\\n  Transfer length: The length requested in one transfer determined by the CMD53 byte/block count field.\\n  Note\\nRequested length is different from the transfer length. In the context of ESP32 SDIO slave DMA, the operation is based on the requested length rather than the transfer length. This means the DMA controller will process the data transfer according to the requested length, ensuring that only data within the requested length is transferred. The transfer length should be no shorter than the requested length, and the rest part is filled with 0 during sending or discard during receiving.\\n  Receiving buffer size: The buffer size is pre-defined between the host and the slave before communication starts. The slave application has to set the buffer size during initialization by the\\nrecv_buffer_sizeparameter in the\\nsdio_slave_config_tstructure.\\nInterrupts: The ESP32 SDIO slave supports interrupts in two directions: from host to slave (referred to as slave interrupts) and from slave to host (referred to as host interrupts).

       " 'If you want to use these features, please ensure both ESP32 and ALL flash chips in your product support these features. For more details, refer to Optional Features for Flash.\\n  You may also customise your own flash chip driver. See Overriding Default Chip Drivers for more details.\\n  Initializing a Flash Device\\nTo use the\\nesp_flash_* APIs, you need to initialise a flash chip on a certain SPI bus, as shown below:\\nCall\\nspi_bus_initialize()to properly initialize an SPI bus. This function initializes the resources (I/O, DMA, interrupts) shared among devices attached to this bus.\\n  Call\\nspi_bus_add_flash_device()to attach the flash device to the bus. This function allocates memory and fills the members for the\\nesp_flash_tstructure. The CS I/O is also initialized here.\\n ',\n",
       " 'This is the set of API functions for working with data in flash:\\nesp_flash_read()reads data from flash to RAM\\nesp_flash_write()writes data from RAM to flash\\nesp_flash_erase_region()erases specific region of flash\\nesp_flash_erase_chip()erases the whole flash\\nesp_flash_get_chip_size()returns flash chip size, in bytes, as configured in menuconfig\\nGenerally, try to avoid using the raw SPI flash functions to the \"main\" SPI flash chip in favour of partition-specific functions.\\n  SPI Flash Size\\nThe SPI flash size is configured by writing a field in the software bootloader image header, flashed at offset 0x1000.\\n  By default, the SPI flash size is detected by\\nesptool.py when this bootloader is written to flash, and the header is updated with the correct size. Alternatively, it is possible to generate a fixed flash size by setting CONFIG_ESPTOOLPY_FLASHSIZE in the project configuration.\\n  If it is necessary to override the configured flash size at runtime, it is possible to set the\\nchip_size member of the\\ng_rom_flashchip structure. This size is used by\\nesp_flash_* functions (in both software & ROM) to check the bounds.\\n  Concurrency Constraints for Flash on SPI1\\nAttention\\nThe SPI0/1 bus is shared between the instruction & data cache (for firmware execution) and the SPI1 peripheral (controlled by the drivers including this SPI flash driver). Hence, calling SPI Flash API on SPI1 bus (including the main flash) causes significant influence to the whole system. See Concurrency Constraints for Flash on SPI1 for more details.\\n  SPI Flash Encryption\\n It is possible to encrypt the contents of SPI flash and have it transparently decrypted by hardware.\\n  Refer to the Flash Encryption documentation for more details.\\n  Memory Mapping API\\nESP32 features memory hardware which allows regions of flash memory to be mapped into instruction and data address spaces. This mapping works only for read operations. It is not possible to modify contents of flash memory by writing to a mapped memory region.\\n ',\n",

See the technical reference manual for more details and limitations about memory mapping hardware.\\n  Note that some pages are used to map the application itself into memory, so the actual number of available pages may be less than the capability of the hardware.\\n  Reading data from flash using a memory mapped region is the only way to decrypt contents of flash when flash encryption is enabled.

As long as each Device is accessed by only one task, the driver is thread-safe. However, if multiple tasks try to access the same SPI Device, the driver is not thread-safe. In this case, it is recommended to either:\\nRefactor your application so that each SPI peripheral is only accessed by a single task at a time.

For more information, see Polling Transactions.\\n  If DMA is enabled, setting up the linked list requires about 2 µs per transaction. When a master is transferring data, it automatically reads the data from the linked list. If DMA is not enabled, the CPU has to write and read each byte from the FIFO by itself. Usually, this is faster than 2 µs, but the transaction length is limited to 64 bytes for both write and read.\\n  The typical transaction duration for one byte of data is given below.\\n  Interrupt Transaction via DMA: 28 µs.\\n Interrupt Transaction via CPU: 25 µs.\\nPolling Transaction via DMA: 10 µs.\\n Polling Transaction via CPU: 8 µs.\\nNote that these data are tested with CONFIG_SPI_MASTER_ISR_IN_IRAM enabled.

As a result, the MISO pin setup time is the limiting factor for the SPI clock speed. When the delay is too long, the setup slack is < 0, which means the setup timing requirement is violated and the reading might be incorrect.\\n The maximum allowed frequency is dependent on:\\nspi_device_interface_config_t::input_delay_ns- maximum data valid time on the MISO bus after a clock cycle on SCLK starts\\nIf the IO_MUX pin or the GPIO Matrix is used\\nWhen the GPIO matrix is used, the maximum allowed frequency is reduced to about 33 ~ 77% in comparison to the existing input delay. To retain a higher frequency, you have to use the IO_MUX pins or the dummy bit workaround. You can obtain the maximum reading frequency of the master by using the function\\nspi_get_freq_limit().\\n Dummy bit workaround: Dummy clocks, during which the Host does not read data, can be inserted before the Read phase begins. The Device still sees the dummy clocks and sends out data, but the Host does not read until the Read phase comes. This compensates for the lack of the MISO setup time required by the Host and allows the Host to do reading at a higher frequency.\\n In the ideal case, if the Device is so fast that the input delay is shorter than an APB clock cycle - 12.5 ns - the maximum frequency at which the Host can read (or read and write) in different conditions is as follows:\\n|\\nFrequency Limit (MHz)\\n|\\nFrequency Limit (MHz)\\n |\\nDummy Bits Used by Driver\\n|\\nComments\\n|\\nGPIO Matrix\\n|\\nIO_MUX Pins\\n|\\n26.6\\n|\\n80\\n|\\nNo\\n|\\n40\\n|\\n--\\n|\\nYes\\n|\\nHalf-duplex, no DMA allowed\\nIf the Host only writes data, the dummy bit workaround and the frequency check can be disabled by setting the bit\\nSPI_DEVICE_NO_DUMMY in the member\\nspi_device_interface_config_t::flags.',\n",

In general, a bus includes the following lines: MISO, MOSI, SCLK, one or more CS lines, and, optionally, QUADWP and QUADHD. So Devices are connected to the same lines, with the exception that each Device has its own CS line. Several Devices can also share one CS line if connected in the daisy-chain manner.\\n\",\n",

The driver can send/receive transactions up to 64 bytes in length, or utilize DMA to send/receive longer transactions. However, there are some known issues related to DMA.\\n  The SPI slave driver supports registering the SPI ISR to a certain CPU core. If multiple tasks try to access the same SPI Device simultaneously, it is recommended that your application be refactored so that each SPI peripheral is only accessed by a single task at a time. Please also use\\nspi_bus_config_t::isr_cpu_id to register the SPI ISR to the same core as SPI peripheral related tasks to ensure thread safety.\\n  SPI Transactions\\nA full-duplex SPI transaction begins when the Host asserts the CS line and starts sending out clock pulses on the SCLK line. Every clock pulse, a data bit is shifted from the Host to the Device on the MOSI line and back on the MISO line at the same time. At the end of the transaction, the Host de-asserts the CS line.\\n  The attributes of a transaction are determined by the configuration structure for an SPI peripheral acting as a slave device\\nspi_slave_interface_config_t, and transaction configuration structure\\nspi_slave_transaction_t.\\n  As not every transaction requires both writing and reading data, you can choose to configure the\\nspi_transaction_t structure for TX only, RX only, or TX and RX transactions. If\\nspi_slave_transaction_t::rx_buffer is set to\\nNULL, the read phase will be skipped. Similarly, if\\nspi_slave_transaction_t::tx_buffer is set to\\nNULL, the write phase will be skipped.\\n  Note\\nA Host should not start a transaction before its Device is ready for receiving data. It is recommended to use another GPIO pin for a handshake signal to sync the Devices. For more details, see Transaction Interval.\\n ',\n",
       " \"As opposed to dedicated slaves, CPU-based SPI Devices have a limited number of pre-defined registers. All transactions must be handled by the CPU, which means that the transfers and responses are not real-time, and there might be noticeable latency.\\n As a solution, a Device's response rate can be doubled by using the functions\\nspi_slave_queue_trans() and then\\nspi_slave_get_trans_result() instead of using\\nspi_slave_transmit().\\n You can also configure a GPIO pin through which the Device will signal to the Host when it is ready for a new transaction. A code example of this can be found in peripherals/spi_slave.\\n SCLK Frequency Requirements\\nThe SPI slaves are designed to operate at up to 10 MHz. The data cannot be recognized or received correctly if the clock is too fast or does not have a 50% duty cycle.\\n On top of that, there are additional requirements for the data to meet the timing constraints:\\n- Read (MOSI):\\nThe Device can read data correctly only if the data is already set at the launch edge. Although it is usually the case for most masters.\\n- Write (MISO):\\nThe output delay of the MISO signal needs to be shorter than half of a clock cycle period so that the MISO line is stable before the next latch edge. Given that the clock is balanced, the output delay and frequency limitations in different cases are given below.\\n/\\nOutput delay of MISO (ns)\\nFreq. limit (MHz)\\nIO_MUX\\n43.75\\n< 11.4\\nGPIO matrix\\n68.75\\n< 7.2\\nNote: 1.\",\n",
       " 'The output delay is measured under ideal circumstances (no load). If the MISO pin is heavily loaded, the output delay will be longer, and the maximum allowed frequency will be lower.\\n  Exception: The frequency is allowed to be higher if the master has more tolerance for the MISO setup time, e.g., latch data at the next edge, or configurable latching time.\\n  Restrictions and Known Issues\\nIf DMA is enabled, the rx buffer should be word-aligned (starting from a 32-bit boundary and having a length of multiples of 4 bytes). Otherwise, DMA may write incorrectly or not in a boundary aligned manner. The driver reports an error if this condition is not satisfied.\\n  Also, a Host should write lengths that are multiples of 4 bytes. The data with inappropriate lengths will be discarded.\\n ',\n",
       " \"Furthermore, DMA requires SPI modes 1 and 3. For SPI modes 0 and 2, the MISO signal has to be launched half a clock cycle earlier to meet the timing. The new timing is as follows:\\nIf DMA is enabled, a Device's launch edge is half of an SPI clock cycle ahead of the normal time, shifting to the Master's actual latch edge. In this case, if the GPIO matrix is bypassed, the hold time for data sampling is 68.75 ns and no longer a half of an SPI clock cycle. If the GPIO matrix is used, the hold time will increase to 93.75 ns. The Host should sample the data immediately at the latch edge or communicate in SPI modes 1 or 3. If your Host cannot meet these timing requirements, initialize your Device without DMA.\\n \",\n",

       " 'Two-Wire Automotive Interface (TWAI)\\nOverview\\nThe Two-Wire Automotive Interface (TWAI) is a real-time serial communication protocol suited for automotive and industrial applications. It is compatible with ISO11898-1 Classical frames, thus can support Standard Frame Format (11-bit ID) and Extended Frame Format (29-bit ID). The ESP32 contains 1 TWAI controller(s) that can be configured to communicate on a TWAI bus via an external transceiver.\\n Warning\\nThe TWAI controller is not compatible with ISO11898-1 FD Format frames, and will interpret such frames as errors.\\n This programming guide is split into the following sections:\\nTWAI Protocol Summary\\nThe TWAI is a multi-master, multi-cast, asynchronous, serial communication protocol. TWAI also supports error detection and signalling, and inbuilt message prioritization.\\n',\n",
       " 'The bus does not contain a clock signal. All nodes on the bus operate at the same bit rate and synchronize using the edges of the bits transmitted on the bus.\\n  Error Detection and Signaling: Every node constantly monitors the bus. When any node detects an error, it signals the detection by transmitting an error frame. Other nodes will receive the error frame and transmit their own error frames in response. This results in an error detection being propagated to all nodes on the bus.\\n  Message Priorities: Messages contain an ID field.',\n",
       " 'The CLKOUT signal line is optional and outputs a prescaled version of the controller\\'s source clock.\\n  Note\\nAn external transceiver must internally loopback the TX to RX such that a change in logic level to the TX signal line can be observed on the RX line. Failing to do so will cause the TWAI controller to interpret differences in logic levels between the two signal lines as a loss in arbitration or a bit error.\\n  API Naming Conventions\\nNote\\nThe TWAI driver provides two sets of API. One is handle-free and is widely used in IDF versions earlier than v5.2, but it can only support one TWAI hardware controller. The other set is with handles, and the function name is usually suffixed with \"v2\", which can support any number of TWAI controllers. These two sets of API can be used at the same time, but it is recommended to use the \"v2\" version in your new projects.\\n  Driver Configuration\\nThis section covers how to configure the TWAI driver.\\n  Operating Modes\\nThe TWAI driver supports the following modes of operations:\\nNormal Mode: The normal operating mode allows the TWAI controller to take part in bus activities such as transmitting and receiving messages/error frames. Acknowledgement from another node is required when transmitting a message.\\n  No Ack Mode: The No Acknowledgement mode is similar to normal mode, however acknowledgements are not required for a message transmission to be considered successful. This mode is useful when self testing the TWAI controller (loopback of transmissions).\\n  Listen Only Mode: This mode prevents the TWAI controller from influencing the bus. Therefore, transmission of messages/acknowledgement/error frames will be disabled. However the TWAI controller is still able to receive messages but will not acknowledge the message. This mode is suited for bus monitor applications.\\n  Alerts\\nThe TWAI driver contains an alert feature that is used to notify the application layer of certain TWAI controller or TWAI bus events. Alerts are selectively enabled when the TWAI driver is installed, but can be reconfigured during runtime by calling\\ntwai_reconfigure_alerts(). The application can then wait for any enabled alerts to occur by calling\\ntwai_read_alerts().',\n",

       " \"TWAI controller can no longer influence bus\\nNote\\nThe TWAI controller's error warning limit is used to preemptively warn the application of bus errors before the error passive state is reached. By default, the TWAI driver sets the error warning limit to 96. The\\nTWAI_ALERT_ABOVE_ERR_WARN is raised when the TEC or REC becomes larger then or equal to the error warning limit. The\\nTWAI_ALERT_BELOW_ERR_WARN is raised when both TEC and REC return back to values below 96.\\n  Note\\nWhen enabling alerts, the\\nTWAI_ALERT_AND_LOG flag can be used to cause the TWAI driver to log any raised alerts to UART. However, alert logging is disabled and\\nTWAI_ALERT_AND_LOG if the CONFIG_TWAI_ISR_IN_IRAM option is enabled (see Placing ISR into IRAM).\\n  Note\\nThe\\nTWAI_ALERT_ALL and\\nTWAI_ALERT_NONE macros can also be used to enable/disable all alerts during configuration/reconfiguration.\\n  Bit Timing\\nThe operating bit rate of the TWAI driver is configured using the\\ntwai_timing_config_t structure. The period of each bit is made up of multiple time quanta, and the period of a time quantum is determined by a pre-scaled version of the TWAI controller's source clock. A single bit contains the following segments in the following order:\\n-\\nThe Synchronization Segment consists of a single time quantum\\n-\\nTiming Segment 1 consists of 1 to 16 time quanta before sample point\\n-\\nTiming Segment 2 consists of 1 to 8 time quanta after sample point\\nThe Baudrate Prescaler is used to determine the period of each time quantum by dividing the TWAI controller's source clock. On the ESP32, the\\nbrp can be any even number from 2 to 128. Alternatively, you can decide the resolution of each quantum, by setting\\ntwai_timing_config_t::quanta_resolution_hz to a non-zero value. In this way, the driver can calculate the underlying\\nbrp value for you. It is useful when you set different clock sources but want the bitrate to keep the same.\\n  Supported clock source for a TWAI controller is listed in the\\ntwai_clock_source_t and can be specified in\\ntwai_timing_config_t::clk_src.\\n  If the ESP32 is a revision 2 or later chip, the\\nbrp will also support any multiple of 4 from 132 to 256, and can be enabled by setting the CONFIG_ESP32_REV_MIN to revision 2 or higher.\\n  The sample point of a bit is located on the intersection of Timing Segment 1 and 2. Enabling Triple Sampling causes 3 time quanta to be sampled per bit instead of 1 (extra samples are located at the tail end of Timing Segment 1).\\n  The Synchronization Jump Width is used to determine the maximum number of time quanta a single bit time can be lengthened/shortened for synchronization purposes.\\n \",\n",

A UART provides a widely adopted and cheap method to realize full-duplex or half-duplex data exchange among different devices.\\n The ESP32 chip has 3 UART controllers (also referred to as port), each featuring an identical set of registers to simplify programming and for more flexibility.\\n Each UART controller is independently configurable with parameters such as baud rate, data bit length, bit ordering, number of stop bits, parity bit, etc. All the regular UART controllers are compatible with UART-enabled devices from various manufacturers and can also support Infrared Data Association (IrDA) protocols.\\n Functional Overview\\nThe overview describes how to establish communication between an ESP32 and other UART devices using the functions and data types of the UART driver. A typical programming workflow is broken down into the sections provided below:\\nSet Communication Parameters - Setting baud rate, data bits, stop bits, etc.\\n Set Communication Pins - Assigning pins for connection to a device\\nInstall Drivers - Allocating ESP32's resources for the UART driver\\nRun UART Communication - Sending/receiving data\\nUse Interrupts - Triggering interrupts on specific communication events\\nDeleting a Driver - Freeing allocated resources if a UART communication is no longer required\\nSteps 1 to 3 comprise the configuration stage. Step 4 is where the UART starts operating. Steps 5 and 6 are optional.\\n The UART driver's functions identify each of the UART controllers using\\nuart_port_t.

       " \"There are many interrupts that can be generated depending on specific UART states or detected errors. The full list of available interrupts is provided in ESP32 Technical Reference Manual > UART Controller (UART) > UART Interrupts and UHCI Interrupts [PDF]. You can enable or disable specific interrupts by calling\\nuart_enable_intr_mask() or\\nuart_disable_intr_mask() respectively.\\n The\\nuart_driver_install() function installs the driver's internal interrupt handler to manage the TX and RX ring buffers and provides high-level API functions like events (see below).\\n The API provides a convenient way to handle specific interrupts discussed in this document by wrapping them into dedicated functions:\\nEvent detection: There are several events defined in\\nuart_event_type_tthat may be reported to a user application using the FreeRTOS queue functionality. You can enable this functionality when calling\\nuart_driver_install()described in Install Drivers. An example of using Event detection can be found in peripherals/uart/uart_events.\\n FIFO space threshold or transmission timeout reached: The TX and RX FIFO buffers can trigger an interrupt when they are filled with a specific number of characters, or on a timeout of sending or receiving data. To use these interrupts, do the following:\\nConfigure respective threshold values of the buffer length and timeout by entering them in the structure\\nuart_intr_config_tand calling\\nuart_intr_config()\\nEnable the interrupts using the functions\\nuart_enable_tx_intr()and\\nuart_enable_rx_intr()\\nDisable these interrupts using the corresponding functions\\nuart_disable_tx_intr()or\\nuart_disable_rx_intr()\\n-\\nPattern detection: An interrupt triggered on detecting a 'pattern' of the same character being received/sent repeatedly. This functionality is demonstrated in the example peripherals/uart/uart_events. It can be used, e.g., to detect a command string with a specific number of identical characters (the 'pattern') at the end. The following functions are available:\\nConfigure and enable this interrupt using\\nuart_enable_pattern_det_baud_intr()\\nDisable the interrupt using\\nuart_disable_pattern_det_intr()\\n-\\nMacros\\nThe API also defines several macros. For example,\\nUART_HW_FIFO_LEN defines the length of hardware FIFO buffers;\\nUART_BITRATE_MAX gives the maximum baud rate supported by the UART controllers, etc.\\nDeleting a Driver\\nIf the communication established with\\nuart_driver_install() is no longer required, the driver can be removed to free allocated resources by calling\\nuart_driver_delete().\\n Overview of RS485 Specific Communication 0ptions\\nNote\\nThe following section uses\\n[UART_REGISTER_NAME].[UART_FIELD_BIT] to refer to UART register fields/bits.

The term collision means that a transmitted datagram is not equal to the one received on the other end. Data collisions are usually associated with the presence of other active devices on the bus or might occur due to bus errors.\\n The collision detection feature allows handling collisions when their interrupts are activated and triggered. The interrupts\\nUART_RS485_FRM_ERR_INT and\\nUART_RS485_PARITY_ERR_INT can be used with the collision detection feature to control frame errors and parity bit errors accordingly in RS485 mode. This functionality is supported in the UART driver and can be used by selecting the\\nUART_MODE_RS485_APP_CTRL mode (see the function\\nuart_set_mode()).\\n The collision detection feature can work with circuit A and circuit C (see Section Interface Connection Options). In the case of using circuit A or B, the RTS pin connected to the DE pin of the bus driver should be controlled by the user application. Use the function\\nuart_get_collision_flag() to check if the collision detection flag has been raised.\\n The ESP32 UART controllers themselves do not support half-duplex communication as they cannot provide automatic control of the RTS pin connected to the RE/DE input of RS485 bus driver. However, half-duplex communication can be achieved via software control of the RTS pin by the UART driver. This can be enabled by selecting the\\nUART_MODE_RS485_HALF_DUPLEX mode when calling\\nuart_set_mode().\\n Once the host starts writing data to the TX FIFO buffer, the UART driver automatically asserts the RTS pin (logic 1); once the last bit of the data has been transmitted, the driver de-asserts the RTS pin (logic 0). To use this mode, the software would have to disable the hardware flow control function. This mode works with all the used circuits shown below.\\nInterface Connection Options\\nThis section provides example schematics to demonstrate the basic aspects of ESP32's RS485 interface connection.\\n Note\\nThe schematics below do not necessarily contain all required elements.\\n The analog devices ADM483 & ADM2483 are examples of common RS485 transceivers and can be replaced with other similar transceivers.\\n\",\n",

This option will use the last debug memory watchpoint to allow breaking into the debugger (or panic'ing) as soon as any of the last 32 bytes on the stack of a task are overwritten. The side effect is that using gdb, you effectively have one hardware watchpoint less because the last one is overwritten as soon as a task switch happens.\\n Another consequence is that due to alignment requirements of the watchpoint, the usable stack size decreases by up to 60 bytes. This is because the watchpoint region has to be aligned to its size and the size for the stack watchpoint in IDF is 32 bytes.\\n This check only triggers if the stack overflow writes within 32 bytes near the end of the stack, rather than overshooting further, so it is worth combining this approach with one of the other stack overflow check methods.\\n When this watchpoint is hit, gdb will stop with a SIGTRAP message.
